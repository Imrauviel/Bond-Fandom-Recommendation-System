4,/wiki/Casino_Royale_(novel),"Casino Royale is the first novel written by Ian Fleming featuring the 00 agent Commander James Bond, published in 1953. The plot revolves around a plan to take down Le Chiffre, an agent of SMERSH, by bankrupting him in a high-stakes game of Baccarat Chemin-de-fer.
Casino Royale has the unique distinction of being the only James Bond novel to be adapted three times: as a 1954 American TV production, a 1967 spoof film, and finally as the basis for the 2006 film of the same name.
The head of Station S, Fawcett formulates a plan to take down SMERSH operative Le Chiffre who is the head of communist sympathizing trade unions in northern France, who is attempting to earn money in game in Baccarat Chemin de fer in order to compensate for the loss of his chain of brothels which were shut down after a law banning prostitution surfaced in France. M sends out his finest gambler, 00 agent Commander James Bond to play in the game. Station S's Vesper Lynd, Texan CIA agent Felix Leiter, and Frenchman René Mathis of the Deuxième Bureau are sent by their respective superiors to assist Bond in his endeavour.
Bond checks into the hotel and prepares his operation. Before Bond has a chance to face off with Le Chiffre, Soviet agents make an attempt on his life. Bond survives a bomb blast unscathed. He makes it to the casino and squares off against Le Chiffre. During the game, Bond is nearly killed by a gunman hired by Le Chiffre. Soon Bond goes bankrupt, but Felix Leiter provides him with extra capital to continue playing. Bond ultimately wins and bankrupts Le Chiffre, earning a sum of 40,000 Francs. After his win Bond takes Vesper out for a drink. However, she is lured into the parking lot and kidnapped by Le Chiffre. Bond pursues her in his Bentley but, after Le Chiffre makes him crash, he is captured himself.
Subsequently Vesper is taken away by Le Chiffre's men while he physically tortures Bond's genitals, seeking to know where the cheque for the money he won was hidden. After a while, he decides he couldn't extract information from Bond and begins sadistic mental torture on him. Shortly after, a SMERSH agent enters and executes both Le Chiffre and his two men by shooting them in the head. The agent spares Bond's life because he had been given no orders to kill him, then tells him about SMERSH's ideals: That they are only known to give mercy by chance or by mistake (both of which have been done in a single day to James Bond) then cuts a ""Ш"" (a Russian/Cyrillic symbol associated with spies) into Bond's left hand for any future SMERSH agents he might run into to identify him. Delirious, exhausted and in tremendous pain, Bond passes out immediately afterward.
Two days later, Bond regains consciousness and Vesper nurses him back to health. While in the hospital Bond contemplates his future as a spy. Three weeks later, they go on vacation where Bond starts a romantic relationship with Vesper. They take a vacation at a French seaside inn. They start a passionate relationship and Bond decides he will ask Vesper to marry him.
Vesper soon realizes that a SMERSH agent using the guise ""Adolph Gettler"" was watching their movements. Vesper grows increasingly fearful and paranoid of this man as he occasionally passes by. Bond catches Vesper making a secret phone call and acting duplicitously. Bond is frustrated and their relationship becomes strained. It comes to a head when Bond demands to know her secret. She promises to tell him the next day. They make passionate love and Bond retires to his own room. Finally, unable to handle the guilt, Vesper deliberately overdoses on sleeping pills that night to commit suicide.
In the morning, Bond finds a letter from Vesper explaining that she was working for the MWD to free her boyfriend who served in the Polish RAF. She had also nearly sabotaged the operation in the casino by not getting in between the gunman. She then tells Bond she started to fall in love with Bond, and this ended up drawing the ire of SMERSH, who sent the agent to track Vesper and Bond. Vesper also stated she wanted to escape to South America, start up a new life with Bond, and have a baby with him. She then finishes the letter with ""My love, my love.""
Because of Vesper's lies and the engraving of ""Ш"" into his right hand Bond decides to oppose SMERSH, an act which sets the rest of the series in motion. The novel then ends with Bond telling his liaison officer that ""the bitch is dead now"".
Casino Royale was the first James Bond novel to be adapted as a daily comic strip which was published in the Daily Express newspaper and syndicated worldwide. It ran from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958, and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky. All strips are missing the familiar ""JAMES BOND"" heading in the top left corner which was used on all subsequent adventures.
To aid the Daily Express in illustrating James Bond, Ian Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of what he believed James Bond to look like. The illustrator, John McLusky, however, felt that Fleming's 007 looked too ""outdated"" and ""pre-war"" and thus changed Bond to give him a more masculine look.

Chang was the one responsible for providing Carver with stealth materials which he stole in secret from one of his military bases for Carver to build his Stealth Ship.
He is seen in Saigon in one of Carver's buildings after he captured both James Bond and Wai Lin. There they discovered the plot and upon escaping, Chang sent troops after Wai Lin to silence her, though his henchmen were unsuccessful.
Chang's ultimate fate is unknown. He was possibly demoted and almost certainly arrested for his involvement with Elliot Carver and attempting to have Wai Lin killed. He may even have been charged with treason, and executed as a result.

19,/wiki/Felix_Leiter_(Jeffrey_Wright),"Felix Leiter is a fictional American CIA intelligence operative. Based on the literary character created by Ian Fleming, Leiter is portrayed by American actor, Jeffrey Wright, and first appeared in the 2006 film, Casino Royale, and was later seen in its 2008 sequel, Quantum of Solace. He again reprises his role in No Time to Die (2021), making him the only actor to play the role of Felix Leiter in three films.
At the Casino Royale in Montenegro Leiter plays in the high-stakes poker game against James Bond and Le Chiffre. Unable to beat Le Chiffre, Leiter backs Bond with a $5 million buy in, after Bond misreads Le Chiffre's bluff, under the agreement that the CIA be the ones to arrest Le Chiffre after the game.
Later, Felix and Gregg Beam work with General Medrano's regime to ensure America gets oil rights in Bolivia when Medrano becomes president by force. Beam indeed negotiated a deal with Quantum operative, Dominic Greene, to ignore his orchestrated coup in Bolivia in exchange for oil, which the section chief assumed Greene had discovered; incorrectly interpreting Greene's bulk purchase of water piping. He and Leiter travel with the Quantum representatives to Austria and while discussing their business arrangements, Greene mentions that he has a 'pest' he would like eliminated as part of the deal. Beam glances at the photo of James Bond and passes it to Leiter, duplicitously asking him to identify it. When Felix lies to the men, Beam identifies Bond and tells Greene he will deal with him. Later in La Paz, 007 phones Leiter at their front office, Incan Exports, and arranges a meeting. Beam sends his men after Bond to kill him. However, Felix, disgusted by Beam's corruption, informs the spy of their dealings with Medrano and that their time window to talk is 30 seconds and warns him about his pursuers, allowing him to escape at the last minute. Following Medrano and Greene's demises, Beam is exposed for his crimes and Leiter replaces him as section chief as M says that to Bond.
Bond mentions Felix Leiter briefly to Lucia Sciarra as a form of protection.
Bond and another CIA agent named Paloma are able to capture Obruchev and the British brings Obruchev back to a boat where Leiter and Ash are waiting. Despite Ash telling Bond that his mission is over, Bond refuses to leave and angrily demands to know who Obruchev is working for. Ash, realizing that there's no way out, reveals his allegiance by pulling out a gun and shooting Leiter in the stomach before kicking him into the hull. The corrupt agent later sinks the ship with a limpet mine before leaving with Obruchev and bringing him over to his boss Safin. Bond escapes the ship, but Leiter bleeds out and drowns to his death, much to Bond's distraught.
Following Blofeld's death, Bond faces off against Ash again, as he invokes Leiter's name as justification, just before Ash is crushed to death by an overturned vehicle in revenge for Leiter's death. After killing Safin and his remaining men, Bond joins Leiter in death by sacrificing himself in a missile explosion to foil Safin's plot. 
Casino Royale allowed Leiter to re-appear and he and Bond meet for the first time in the film. Early script drafts for Quantum of Solace gave Wright a larger role, but his screen time was restricted by on-set rewrites. Wright became the second actor to play the role of Leiter multiple times after David Hedison in 1973's Live and Let Die and 1989's Licence to Kill. He returned to the role in No Time to Die.

Kennedy included it in a list of his favorite books; the James Bond novel was the only work of fiction in the list of ten.
The title of the book is occasionally printed with a comma, as From Russia, with Love, depending upon the publisher. It is more commonly printed without the punctuation. In 1979, Oxford University Press published a simplified adaptation of the novel, written by Rosemary Border, under its Alpha Thrillers imprint; this version was intended for people learning to read.
In Istanbul, Bond meets Darko Kerim, the leader of the British substation in Istanbul. Bond likes this man on sight.

28,/wiki/Elektra_King_(Sophie_Marceau),"Elektra Vavra King was the daughter of wealthy oil tycoon, Sir Robert King, but also a criminal mastermind associated with terrorist, Renard. One of the two main antagonists in the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough, she was portrayed by French actress, Sophie Marceau, and also appeared in the film's accompanying novelization penned by Raymond Benson as well as its video games.
Elektra is the daughter of Sir Robert King and his second wife. Her maternal background is of Azerbaijani descent; the family had fled the country immediately after the Soviet Union was established and relocated to England. Robert King's marriage had become a much noted affair as he managed to acquire his father-in-law's oil business and assimilate it into his own construction enterprise, forming the official King Industries.
Elektra's subsequent birth was also subject of much press coverage, foreshadowing much of the attention she would receive later on in her early adulthood. As the only daughter of a lucrative oil baron, Elektra had a privileged upbringing, becoming a tad bit spoiled in the process. She attended prestigious private schools around Europe and often spent summer vacationing with her maternal family in the Middle East. After college, Elektra decided to follow in her father's footsteps and join King Enterprises.
Much to the media's delight, Elektra's business affiliation and beauty made her a well known figure in the press. The fame eventually drew the attention of the anarchist Renard, who decided to kidnap her in a scheme to extort a large sum from her father. Sir Robert refused to pay the ransom on the advice of family friend (and James Bond's boss) M. Embittered, she became Renard's lover and participated in his scheme to extort money from her family (going so far as to mutilate her own left ear so Renard could send it to her father as a warning) but pretended to have been traumatized by the kidnapping. (Bond thought she suffered from Stockholm syndrome, but may have been blinded by his affection for her).
Having survived the bombing, Valentin Zukovsky and his men take mount a raid on the tower. Reaching the room where Elektra has Bond, he is shot by her. Dying, Zukovsky uses his cane gun to free Bond, who then chases after the fleeing Elektra, freeing M in the process. During a tense standoff, and at the business end of a gun, Bond demands that Elektra order Renard to call off the imminent meltdown in the city. Elektra then taunts Bond, telling him that he wouldn't shoot her and that he would miss her as she didn't see him as a killer of a former lover in cold blood. She then radios Renard and in her overconfidence on her hold over Bond, she instead tells him to proceed with the plan, and out of anger, Bond immediately kills her with a single gunshot while exclaiming ""I never miss"".
Elektra was a woman who was used to getting what she wants. She did not like to be resisted and will do anything to get her way, including using her charms, torturing and killing anyone who tries to stand in her way. She's also an excellent tactician and actress who passes for an innocent girl when she's really one of the brains behind her operation.

The character appeared in the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun and was portrayed by Swedish actress Maud Adams. Andrea also appeared in the James Bond 007 tabletop role-playing game.
At the start of the film, Andrea is seen with Francisco Scaramanga, a famous assassin, on his private island in Red Chinese waters, first helping him dry off after a swim and then sunbathes with him. After the pre-title sequence, the plot for the story becomes clear: James Bond has been sent a note from Scaramanga, with a golden bullet engraved with '007'. As the plot unfolds it becomes clear that Miss Anders sent the note and the bullet hoping Bond would come and eventually kill Scaramanga. She considers Scaramanga a ""monster"" but she cannot just leave him because, according to her, people just don't walk out on him as he would kill her or have her killed.
After watching the mysterious Miss Anders collect a shipment of Scaramanga's custom-made gold bullets from a casino in Macau, Bond follows her back to her hotel in Hong Kong and walks in on her as she showers. Startled, she opens the shower door and points a Beretta at him (Bond quips 'a water pistol?'). Demanding a bathrobe she escorts him out of the bathroom at gunpoint. 
As she makes a call to the reception desk, Bond lifts and opens the cigarette packet containing Lazar's bullets. Unnerved, she orders him to give them to her. He obliges and as he passes her the packet, he knocks the weapon from her hand and pins her to the bed. Bond proceeds to interrogate Andrea about her connection with Scaramanaga, threatening first to break her arm if she refuses and then slapping her when she proves uncooperative. She eventually reveals that she is his mistress and divulges his location for that evening; the Bottoms Up Club.
Later that evening, after assassinating British scientist named Gibson, Scaramanga returns to his Junk moored in Hong Kong harbour. Andrea is in bed awaiting him looking uncomfortable. Drawing the golden gun from his jacket pocket, he sensuously caresses her arm and lips with the weapon, eliciting a fearful and repulsed response from the girl.
Later, while romancing fellow agent Mary Goodnight, Bond is visited by Andrea in his hotel room, where she says that she wants Scaramanga dead and she says that Bond can have anything that he wants as long as he kills him. Bond considers the solex agitator, and the young woman says that he can have it and her as well (saying she is not unattractive). She then changes into a light blue bathrobe which Bond admits is charming, and Anders turns off the light. Bond and Andrea kiss and 007 says that sending the bullet to MI6 was an inspiration. He then opens up her bathrobe, and drops it. It falls to the floor leaving her completely naked and the two of them engage in sex.
That night, Andrea goes back to Scaramanga on his junk, on the pretence she has been to the cinema. Scaramanga demandingly asks where she has been, to which she replies 'it was a double feature' (still claiming she was at the cinema). As she puts away her jewellery in Scaramanga's safe, she sees the solex agitator and thinks of Bond. Suspecting she is up to something, Scaramanga enquires what she is doing, and his reply is 'I'm just putting my jewellery away'.
The next morning, Bond meets Miss Anders at a Thai kick boxing match to pick up the solex, but upon arriving and finding that she is not replying, Bond finds that she has already been shot and killed after Scaramanga discovers her deceit. Scaramanga had shot her in such a manner that the bullet struck her heart but the entry wound was partially concealed by her jacket. Obviously searching for the solex after her murder, Scaramanga fails although Bond notices once Scaramanga comes and sits next to him that the solex had fallen out of her purse onto the floor, and Bond carefully guides it with his foot as Scaramanga says of Anders: ""Forget the girl, she is replaceable"".
In the end, Andrea got her wish when Bond gunned Scaramanga down during a duel on his island.
Though having loved Scaramaga, Andrea became fearful of him and loathed his trigger-happy enjoyment of killing. She was willing to do whatever it took to rid herself of this ""monster"" forever even if it meant deceiving others, which is why she set up Bond to kill Scaramanga in the first place, as in her opinion, simply leaving her former lover would only make her his next target. However after feeling guilty for setting Bond up, she willing agreed to help in his mission if it meant he would kill Scaramanga for her.

31,/wiki/Dalton,"Timothy Peter Dalton (born March 21, 1944 or 1946) is a British actor of stage and screen, famous for being chosen as the fourth Eon James Bond.
Timothy Dalton was born in Colwyn Bay, Wales, UK, he is of mixed English and Italian-Irish ancestry. Soon after his birth, the family moved to Belper, Derbyshire, England, UK. He became interested in acting in his teenage years, and left school in 1962 to enrol in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and tour with the National Youth Theatre in the summer. He did not complete his RADA studies, leaving the academy in 1966 to join the ensemble of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. He quickly moved to television, working mainly with BBC, and in 1968 made his film debut in The Lion in Winter, the first of several period dramas.
After a few more films, Dalton took a break in 1971 to concentrate on the theatre, performing with the Royal Shakespeare Company and other troupes throughout the world. With the exception of the 1975 film Permission to Kill, he remained a theatre actor until 1978. That year he starred in Sextette, hailing his return to cinema and the beginning of his American career. While in the United States, Dalton worked mainly in television, although he starred in several European films and gave notable performances for the BBC.
In 1986, after Roger Moore's retirement from the James Bond role, Dalton was approached to replace him but obligations to the film Brenda Starr kept him from accepting the role. Sam Neill was then screentested for the part of Bond but was ultimately rejected by ""Cubby"" Broccoli. Pierce Brosnan was then approached for the role, but rescinded because of his commitment to the television revival of Remington Steele. In the ensuing time, Dalton had completed the filming of Brenda Starr and was now able to accept the role of Bond.
Previously, Dalton had been offered the role in 1969 to replace Sean Connery after You Only Live Twice, but turned it down feeling he was too young for the role and because of what he felt was an imposing legacy left behind by Connery. He was approached again following Connery's second departure after Diamonds Are Forever but again declined, citing the same reasons. He was offered the part a third time in 1981 when Roger Moore decided to retire from the character prior to For Your Eyes Only; Dalton was apparently all but signed to the role when Moore decided to continue at the last moment. Work commitments made him again refuse the role in 1986, but when asked again, he finally agreed to appear in three James Bond films. The first, The Living Daylights (1987) was successful and grossed more than the previous two Roger Moore Bond films as well as contemporary box office rivals such as Die Hard and Lethal Weapon.
The second film, Licence to Kill (1989) did not perform as well at the U.S. box office, partly due to a lacklustre marketing campaign, after the title of the film was abruptly changed from Licence Revoked, and partly because it was released in competition with other action blockbusters Batman, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Lethal Weapon 2, Ghost Busters II, Honey I Shrunk the Kids and Back to the Future Part II over the summer of 1989. As a direct result of the latter, no Bond movie since has been released over the summer months. However, MGM reported a net profit of $28.2 million for the film.
Dalton's third Bond film (rumoured title: The Property of A Lady) was due for a 1991 release but its production was scuttled by internecine corporate litigation between Danjaq, LLC, the copyright holder of James Bond on screen and MGM/United Artists (Giancarlo Parretti), the financier and distributor of the series. In 1994, tired of waiting for a film that seemed as though it would never happen, Dalton officially dropped the James Bond role, re-opening the door for Pierce Brosnan.
Dalton's portrayal of Bond - darker, more grittily realistic and truer to the original character as portrayed in Fleming's novels - was something of a double-edged sword. Critics welcomed a more serious interpretation after more than a decade of Roger Moore's lighthearted approach but the reaction of Moore aficionados and those who had grown up with Moore as their Bond during his 15 year tenure and were generally unfamiliar with Ian Fleming's original novels was mixed. Despite the contemporary criticism, rumours persist to this day that Dalton had always been high on ""Cubby"" Broccoli's list of ideal Bond actors. More recent evaluation has warmed somewhat to Dalton's brief tenure, with some critics noting the similarities between his gritty performance and that of Daniel Craig.
After his Bond films, Dalton's career entered an uncertain period. Successes on stage and television were balanced by indifferent films. He also endured the unenviable assignment of playing Rhett Butler in Scarlett; the television mini-series sequel to Gone with the Wind. In 2003, he played a parody of James Bond named Damian Drake in the film Looney Tunes: Back in Action. He recently appeared in Doctor Who as the character Rassilon in the 2009-10 two-part special, The End of Time, and returned to feature films as the villain in Hot Fuzz.
He co-starred in the TV series Penny Dreadful (2014-16) created by and solely written by John Logan and produced by Logan and Sam Mendes and also starred Eva Green, Rory Kinnear, and Helen McCrory.

Following the film, he achieved worldwide recognition for his role as Mr. Roarke's assistant, Tattoo, in the television series Fantasy Island, which ran from 1978–1984. He was also an acclaimed painter. He committed suicide by shooting himself in 1993.

33,/wiki/Felix_Leiter_(Rik_Van_Nutter),"Felix Leiter is a fictional character invented by Ian Fleming in the James Bond books, who also appears in the Bond movies. In the films, Leiter works for the CIA, and assists Bond in his various adventures. He was portrayed by Rik Van Nutter in the 1965 film Thunderball.
James Bond teams up with Felix Leiter to find a hijacked plane that was carrying two atomic bombs, which they eventually find along with the corpse of the phony NATO observer. He then watches over Domino while Bond is chased through town by Fiona Volpe and her SPECTRE agents. Bond is later rescued by Leiter from the underwater cave where bombs were concealed. Bond informs Felix of the location of the bomb and a platoon of US Navy Frogman attack Emilio Largo's men whilst James pursues Largo in his yacht, the Disco Volante.
The fourth film in the EON Productions series, Thunderball, was the third to portray Leiter and the producers chose a third actor to play the role, Rik Van Nutter. Van Nutter was married to Swedish actress Anita Ekberg at the time and the couple had dined with Cubby and Dana Broccoli after Ekberg had appeared in the Eon-produced Call Me Bwana. Van Nutter was subsequently offered the Leiter role without an audition, although he did have screen tests with some of the Bond girls.
According to Pfeiffer and Worrall, Leiter had a more proactive role in Thunderball and Van Nutter was ""an inspired choice for the role"". Smith and Lavington agree and consider that Van Nutter's ""relaxed and charming performance works well."" Benson also concurs, but complains that although Van Nutter is a piece of successful casting, ""the script … does not give the character any real depth"".

34,/wiki/Emile_Leopold_Locque,"Emile Leopold Locque was a fictional Belgian henchman in the employ of Greek heroin smuggler Aristotle Kristatos. The secondary antagonist in the 1981 James Bond film, For Your Eyes Only, the character was portrayed by the late British actor, Michael Gothard, and also appeared in the comic adaptation by Marvel Comics.
Emile Locque was an enforcer in the Brussels underworld. On January 31, 1975, after being convicted of several particularly brutal murders, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in Namur Prison, Belgium. During his incarceration, he escaped by strangling his psychiatrist and subsequently worked for drug syndicates in Hong Kong and France. It was at one of the syndicates he came to the attention of a Greek drug smuggler named Aris Kristatos, who soon recruited Locque into working for him.
In 1981, Locque is first encountered by James Bond at a private estate in Madrid, Spain. The enforcer is delivering payment to Cuban hitman Hector Gonzales for the murder of marine archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock and his wife. Suddenly, Havelock's vengeful daughter, Melina, hiding in nearby bushes, shoots Gonzales in the back with a crossbow. As Bond escapes and chaos ensues, Locque keeps his calm, simply sighing to himself that Gonzales did not have much time to enjoy his ill-gotten gains, taking back the case of money and taking advantage of the bedlam to make a quiet getaway. Returning to London, Bond attempts to discover the identity of the man paying off Gonzales using Q Branch's Idenigraph system; a computer-like device which assembles a phantom photo of a person by selecting characteristics from a variety of lists including hair colour, hair style, nose form, style of eyeglasses etc. Q behaves like a composite artist, assembling the profile on a computer (though he has trouble at first, giving the suspect an extra long nose like Pinocchio, causing Bond to remark ""he needs a nose, Q, not a banana!"". Finishing with Locque's distinctive steel rimmed, octagonal glasses, Bond confidently states ""That's him. That's our man."" The Identigraph then connects with police computers, and prints out a headshot of Locque. Q also notes that he was recently sighted in Italy.
Arriving in the Italian ski resort of Cortina, Bond attends a biathlon event with Aris Kristatos' protégée, Bibi Dahl. Observing Bond leave the biathlon course, and sensing an opportunity to kill him, Locque signals for enforcer Claus and his accomplice to cut him off. Meanwhile, his fellow henchman, Erich Kriegler, attempts to snipe Bond from the slope above. Bond manages to evade the mercenaries and escape to the relative safety of the Olympic ski jump.
Following him, Locque and Claus enter a lift with Bond. It is here that Bond notices the dove pin attached to Locque's lapel. At the top, the pair split up - Locque preventing Bond from retreating back and Claus preparing to kill him on the way down the 90-meter Olympic ski jump. At the same time, Kriegler arrives at the base of the jump and prepares to snipe Bond. With no other option available, the spy is forced to use the slope, brawling with Claus and subsequently escaping.
Locque returns later and kills Luigi Ferrara, Bond's Italian contact. As Ferrara waits for Bond to return from his discussion with Bibi, Locque slits his throat. Attempting to further frame Kristatos' rival, Milos ""The Dove"" Columbo, he leaves a white dove lapel pin in the dead man's hand. Having discovered the body, 007 travels to Corfu to find out more about The Dove.
After Bond spends the night with Columbo's mistress Lisl von Schlaf, Locque and his men attack Bond and Lisl as they stroll along the beach. Using dune buggies, Claus and an unnamed driver force Lisl into the path of Locque's vehicle. She is killed instantly much to Bond's agony. Seconds later Claus clips Bond with his buggy and holds him at gunpoint. He orders him into Locque's vehicle, but is struck in the back by a harpoon shot by one of Columbo's men emerging from the sea. In the confusion, Locque quickly accelerates away.
Under the cover of darkness, Bond accompanies Columbo and his crew on a raid at one of Kristatos' opium-processing warehouses in Albania. Locque is overseeing a shipment of raw opium smuggled in enormous rolls of newsprint. Columbo's men begin to open fire and Bond cautiously pursues the fleeing Locque into the warehouse, uncovering naval mines similar to the one that sank the St. Georges, suggesting it was not an accident. As his men provide cover, Locque wires explosives to one of the mines, taking the detonator with him to a nearby escape car. Bond notices the explosives and they narrowly escape the building before it violently explodes.
Recovering from the explosion, 007 sees Locque's car pulling away and gives chase on foot. After intercepting Locque at the summit of the hill, he shoots the enforcer in the shoulder, causing him to lose control of the vehicle. Though not killed by the gunshot, his car is left hanging precariously over the edge of the cliff.
Approaching the tottering car, Bond holds up the dove pin which the Locque left on the body of Ferrara. He returns it to its rightful owner, tossing it through the passenger window at him, and as the ground begins to give way, 007 coldly kicks the car over the edge, sending Locque to his death on the jagged rocks at the bottom of the cliff.
To be added
Locque is a sly and vicious assassin who is tasked with the more convenient work of Kristatos' intricate business. He delights in his work, showing no remorse for the people his killed. However, when he realizes his own life is endangered, he does show fear and screamed when James Bond kicked his car over the edge to his death.
Locque does not say a single word throughout the entire film, except a cry of pain when Bond shoots him and a scream when his car goes over the cliff. In the ski resort he can be seen speaking to his radio transmitter, but the conversation is drowned out — the only telltale sign of speech is that his lips are moving.
Seven years later, a similar scene would be shot in the film License to Kill. A turncoat villain, Ed Killifer, would find himself in a similar life-or-death situation after a fight with Bond, being suspended over a shark tank. Like Locque, Ed Killifer had caused harm to an ally of Bond. A main difference is that the villain and his underlings, rather than Killifer himself, were the ones to hurt Bond's friend, and Killifer felt unease at what transpired, whereas Locque seemed to control his emotions until the very end of his life. Another main difference was that the underlings of Franz Sanchez were often hotheaded and did their hurting out of anger, whereas Locque expressed his sadism in an aloof and detached style. Killifer, however, was more loquacious than Locque, offering Bond $2 million if he let him live.
Another similarity was that both men shouted at their pending dooms, but Locque's was from defenestration, whereas Killifer fell into a marine tank and screamed as he was now a meal for the shark. Yet another comparison was that Bond threw objects at both men which were related to hurting others, but in this case the object thrown was a briefcase full of the bribe money. Unlike the car kicking (as the dove pin was too light to make much impact), the suitcase in and of itself was thrown with sufficient force to cause Killifer to lose his balance. Killifer's death as opposed to Locque's could be surmised as more ""Bond like"", with Bond dryly remarking ""You earned it, you keep it, old buddy.""

A major antagonist, the character appeared in the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace and was portrayed by Spanish actor Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Colonel Carlos starts off as the contact of French agent René Mathis when James Bond goes over to La Paz, Bolivia, to investigate Dominic Greene's intent of securing a portion of Bolivian land for Quantum. He also meets Bond and MI6 agent Strawberry Fields during the Greene Planet Fundraiser Party, right before Bond escapes while Fields is killed by Greene's henchmen.
Eventually, Carlos reveals his true colors by murdering Mathis and implanting his body inside Bond's car in order to frame Bond for the murder and have him arrested by the police. However, Bond escapes again after killing two of Carlos' policemen, much to Carlos' anger.
Eventually, Carlos meets with exiled Bolivian general Luiz Medrano in Perla de las Dunas, a hotel in the Bolivia's Atacama Desert, as it turns out that Carlos is in cahoots in helping Medrano overthrow the Bolivian government as part of Greene's plan. Carlos receives his share of the money (through euros) from Elvis for his efforts, but before he leaves in his car, Bond jumps on the departing vehicle and shouts ""You and I had a mutual friend!"" before shooting him and his driver in the heads in revenge for Mathis' death. Carlos and the driver's bodies are destroyed when the car explodes after reversing into a fuel tank.

37,/wiki/ATAC,"The ATAC (an acronym of or Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator) is a device used by the Ministry of Defence to communicate and co-ordinate the Royal Navy's fleet of Polaris submarines. The equipment appeared in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only along with its comic adaptation by Marvel Comics.
At the beginning of For Your Eyes Only, the British spy ship St. Georges is stationed in the Ionian Sea, trawling off the coast of Albania. In the lower hull of the boat is a sealed control room containing the Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC), a system used by the Ministry of Defence to communicate with and co-ordinate the Royal Navy's fleet of Polaris submarines. While the ship's decoy fishing crew hauls in a net, they accidentally bring with it an old anti-warship mine which explodes, sinking the vessel and drowning the crew before they can trigger the ATAC's self-destruct mechanism. A hunt for the St. Georges and the ATAC ensues, with the British Secret Service dispatching underwater archaeologist, Timothy Havelock to find the ship. Meanwhile, their Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union's KGB contact Aris Kristatos, who it is implied sank the St. Georges, to acquire the transmitter. After Kristatos has Havelock assassinated by a hitman, the British send James Bond to investigate.
Bond accidentally makes contact with Havelock's vengeful daughter, Melina, and travels to the Havelock's yacht where the dead man's journal suggests he had been diving in an unusual underwater location. The pair travel there in her father's mini-submarine and find the St. Georges. The enter the wreck and discover that the ATAC's explosive charge had been armed, but failed to be detonated by the crew. As Bond disarms the charge and extracts the transmitter from its housing, the pair are attacked by one of Kristatos' men in a JIM suit. After a struggle, 007 manages to escape and kill the diver by attaching the magnetic thermite charge to the JIM suit, arming the timing mechanism, which subsequently detonates. The pair flee the sunken ship with the ATAC transmitter and return to the surface. They are promptly ambushed. Kristatos steals the ATAC and makes a failed attempt to kill the pair by trawling them through the water as shark bait. The Soviet spy arranges a handover of the equipment at St. Cyril's Monastery, but is foiled by the combined efforts of Bond, Melina, and Milos Columbo. 007 retrieves the ATAC from Kristatos and as General Gogol arrives to take posession of it, the British spy hurls it over the side of the cliff - destroying it completely.

Bond meets with him at his mansion in California, which has been shipped stone-by-stone from France. While there, Drax and Bond go hunting in the estate grounds, where an assassination attempt by one of Drax's men is foiled. At Drax's research facility Bond meets Dr. Goodhead who sets him up in a machine which simulates g forces, although one of Drax's men tries to kill him by making it spin dangerously fast.

‘No,’ said James. ‘I’ve given you enough chances. Face facts. I’m a better player than any of you, and if you carry on you’ll all end up with nothing.’ 
‘Well, if you will not give us the chance to win the money fairly, we will have to 
take it,’ said Gerhardt, jutting his big chin out aggressively. 
‘Don’t be stupid,’ said James. ‘You may be dressed up like toy soldiers, but I’ll bet you know nothing about fighting. Believe me. If you take me on, you will lose again. My advice to you is to spend a little less time learning to march about waving flags and a little more time learning to play cards. Until then, you should steer clear of any game more complicated than snap.’

43,/wiki/Eurocopter_Tiger,"The Tiger is a high-tech stealth vehicle, developed by Eurocopter for the advanced technological battlefield of the 21st century. A prototype of the aircraft was being tested off of the French frigate La Fayette, which was in dock in Monte Carlo for a public demonstration when it was stolen by Janus Operatives, Xenia Onatopp and Arkady Orumov. It was sought it out for it's anti-radiation properties, to utilize during their test fire of the electromagnetic super-weapon: GoldenEye. The two operatives murdered the pilots and then impersonated them as they hijacked the helicopter. James Bond attempted to thwart the theft, but was restrained by French authorities as the stolen Tiger left the scene.
Onatopp and Ourumov then used the helicopter for their infiltration of Severnaya, where they murdered the technical staff and stole the key to the GoldenEye. They then fled the scene aboard the Tiger as the weapon was fired upon Severnaya to wipe clean any evidence of their activities. As designed, the Tiger safely fled the area, unaffected by the resulting EMP which destroyed the facility and a trio of Russian MIGs deployed to investigate the situation. Monitoring the scene via satellite surveillance, MI6 lost track of the Tiger in the aftermath of the blast; 007 was sent to track down the Tiger and the GoldenEye before either could be used again.
In his face-to-face meeting with Janus, 007 discovered the Tiger helicopter at a statue park in St. Petersburg where Janus awaited his arrival. Janus himself, revealed to be Bond's former ally Alec Trevelyan then captured Bond and strapped both him and Severnaya survivor Natalya Simonova in the Tiger, intending to destroy it along with themselves. The Tiger launched a pair of anti-aircraft missiles at itself, and Bond hit the eject button just as the missiles found their target, destroying the Tiger.
The Eurocopter Tiger is renamed the ""Pirate"", a stealth helicopter of similar design that is targeted for theft by Janus while undergoing testing aboard the FS La Fayette. To steal it, a team of Janus commandos overtake the vessel and take the crew hostage, intending to blow up the vessel as they flee with their prize. MI6 sends Bond to resolve the crisis, saving the ship and its crew but unable to prevent the Pirate's capture. However, Bond plants a tracking bug on the vehicle, prompting him to pursue it to Russia in the hopes of finding Janus. The helicopter as in the film is finally found in the statue park in St. Petersburg, where Bond rescues Natalya before it is destroyed by Janus. Bond eventually recovers the flight recorder from Defense Minister Dmitri Mishkin at the Archives, proving the traitorous General Ourumov's involvement with Janus.
Development of the real-life Tiger started during the Cold War, and it was initially intended as an anti-tank helicopter platform to be used against a Soviet ground invasion of Western Europe. During its prolonged development period the Soviet Union collapsed, but France and Germany chose to proceed with the Tiger, developing it instead as a multirole attack helicopter. It first entered service in 2003 and achieved operational readiness in 2008.
In GoldenEye 007 the Tiger's spiritual counterpart, the ""Pirate"" strongly resembles the American-built AH-64 Apache gunship.

44,/wiki/Carlos_(Claudio_Santamaria),"Weapons manufacturerCarlos Nikolic was the assumed identity of a fictional freelance weapons manufacturer and terrorist. A minor antagonist, the character first appeared in the 2006 James Bond film, Casino Royale, portrayed by Italian actor, Claudio Santamaria, and was later seen in the 2008 video-game, 007: Quantum of Solace.
The terrorist financier Le Chiffre uses a Ugandan warlord's money to short-sell stock in Skyfleet, a promising aerospace company, thus betting the money on the company's failure. After his original bomb-maker is killed by James Bond in Madagascar, Carlos is hired to destroy the company's Skyfleet S570 prototype.
After 007 has killed his boss Alex Dimitrios, the spy notices that the ticket has disappeared and that the bag that was stored in the cloakroom under that ticket has gone. Running outside to be confronted by the mass of people, Bond uses quick thinking to call the person using Dimitrios' phone, since he had sent a text to him already. After identifying the target, Bond follows Carlos to Miami International airport.
At the airport, Bond follows the terrorist who changes into a police uniform. He enters a restricted area just before Bond can stop the entry door from closing. Thinking about it for a few moments, Bond gets an idea that the text sent to Mollaka might spell out the numbers to use on the keypad. Luckily, Bond's guess is right and he makes a hurried pursuit.
In order to distract security staff and remain unchallenged, Carlos activates the sprinkler system as a diversion, and walks out onto the runway. He commandeers a fuel truck and before heading off towards the Skyfleet S570prototype, attaches a small keyring bomb to the underside of the tanker. Bond pursues Carlos on foot, managing to run up some aircraft stairs and jumps on top of the tanker. Carlos tries to dislodge Bond by running the tanker into all sorts of aircraft vehicles, while he tries to get Carlos out of the cabin. As the tanker approaches the Skyfleet S570 prototype, Carlos jumps from the tanker leaving Bond to stop the tanker just before it hits the plane. After Bond is arrested by police, Carlos smugly activates his bomb's detonator. During the fight however, Bond had managed to remove the bomb from the tanker, placing it on Carlos' belt. He realises this too late when he is killed in the resulting explosion.
During the course of the 2008 video-game 007: Quantum of Solace, Bond opens up to Camille Montes about the death of his former love, recounting the events of Casino Royale. The player follows through the plot of Casino Royale, with Bond infiltrating the Science Center to kill Dimitrios and eventually saving Skyfleet from Carlos and an army of terrorists who have hijacked Miami International Airport. The level concludes with a pitched battle inside the S570's hangar. In an introductory cut-scene the character is identified as Carlos Decameron, an unemployed American electrical engineer and a suspected arsonist and weapons manufacturer.
Listed in the film's credits as simply 'Carlos', the character's (presumably fake) surname is 'Nikolic' according to his police uniform ID tag. The name may be an in-joke reference to set dressing department coordinator Marija Nikolic who notably worked in Casino Royale's Costume and Wardrobe Department.

James David Graham Niven was born in London to William Edward Graham Niven (1878–1915) and Henrietta Julia Degacher. He was named David for his birth on St. David's Day (1 March). Niven often claimed that he was born in Kirriemuir, in the Scottish county of Angus in 1909, but his birth certificate shows this was not the case.
Henrietta was of French and British ancestry. She was born in Wales, the daughter of army officer William Degacher (1841–1879) by his marriage to Julia Caroline Smith, the daughter of Lieutenant General James Webber Smith. Niven's grandfather William Degacher was killed in the Battle of Isandlwana (1879), during the Zulu War.  Born William Hitchcock, he and his brother Henry had followed the lead of their father, Walter Henry Hitchcock, in assuming their mother's maiden name of Degacher in 1874.
William Niven, David's father, was of Scottish descent; his paternal grandfather, David Graham Niven, (1811–1884) was from St. Martin's, a village in Perthshire. William served in the Berkshire Yeomanry in the First World War and was killed during the Gallipoli Campaign on 21 August 1915. He was buried in Green Hill Cemetery, Turkey in the Special Memorial Section in Plot F. 10.
David's mother Henrietta then married Sir Thomas Comyn-Platt in London in 1917. Graham Lord, in Niv: The Authorised Biography of David Niven, suggested that Comyn-Platt and Mrs. Niven had been having an affair for some time before her husband's death, and that Sir Thomas may well have been David Niven's biological father, a supposition which has some support from her children. A reviewer of Lord's book stated that Lord's photographic evidence showing a strong physical resemblance between Niven and Comyn-Platt ""would appear to confirm these theories, though photographs can often be misleading.”
David Niven had three older siblings:
The source for the dates and places of birth of the above is William Edward Graham Niven's army service record which does not give a place of birth for David, but his birth certificate states Belgrave Mansions, London. The family's country home at Buckland, Carswell Manor, was sold shortly after David's birth.

46,/wiki/Eve_Sharma,"Eve Sharma was a fictional British senior field officer of the United Kingdom's domestic security agency, MI5. The character served as an ally and Bond girl in Dynamite Entertainment's second James Bond comic arc, Eidolon, which ran between June 22 and December 28, 2016.
"
47,/wiki/Gebr%C3%BCder_Gumbold,"Gumbold and his brother were Swiss solicitors who operated from an office in Bern, Switzerland. One of his clients was the infamous outlaw, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who had gone into hiding at his Alpine clinic, Piz Gloria, following the failure of his scheme to blackmail the Western powers with stolen atomic bombs. Between June and August 1969, Gumbold acted as a middle-man in Blofeld's secretive correspondence with the College of Arms in London, as he attempted to legally obtain the title of ""Count Balthazar de Bleuchamp"". James Bond discovered the connection via the Head of the Unione Corse crime syndicate, Marc-Ange Draco, and infiltrated Gumbold's office during his lunch hour. By the time he returned, 007 had cracked his safe and photocopied letters between the parties involved.

49,/wiki/Blood_Stone,"In 2010, after stopping a terrorist from destroying a fundraiser, Bond is given a new assignment, a scientist who specializes in biological engineering goes missing, presumed dead as his boat was found capsized in the ocean. The US Echelon system picks up a cell phone call that pertains to his disappearance that he is alive and the call was made in Istanbul. Bond is sent to investigate whether it was the scientist or not. Posing as professor of the British Museum, James investigates the foreman's office but was already found out and he manages to escape before the trailer was put in the pit. James manages to head down to the catacombs and heard the scientist reveal codes to a man and is soon killed before Bond could save him. Bond chases down the man who was interrogating him and learns that he was hired to interrogate the scientist by a man named Pomerov.
Using an MI6 cover agent, fashion-designer Nicole Hunter, who has ties to Pomerov, Bond infiltrates a Casino owned by him while Nicole meets with him as a way to get Bond in without Pomerov noticing. Bond finds incriminating evidence in Pomerov's safe, and it's revealed that he had the scientist kidnapped and interrogated to create weaponized biological agents from vaccinations that the scientist was working on but triggers an alarm and fights his way out to Nicole.
Again, using Nicole as cover for Bond's infiltration, he heads to a facility in Siberia to determine whether Pomerov is indeed creating WMDs, and upon learning that such is the case, Bond destroys the facility, hunts Pomerov down, and eliminates him before he can flee the country.
Thought it seems that everything is wrapped up, Bond concludes that some third party tipped MI6 off about what was happening in Istanbul, as the scientist couldn't have made the calls that MI6 believed him to have made, being that he was imprisoned at the time. Bond sets out to discover the who and why.
Finding himself in Bangkok, Bond meets with Colonel Ping who claims to know who was really behind it all: a criminal named Rak. Suddenly, Rak's men attack and kill the officer, but Bond survives and hunts down the assassin, who confirms that Rak has something to do with everything. Unable to find Rak on his own, Bond meets with an old acquaintance while evading the police for causing many property damage in the chase with Ping's assassin before he was killed. He learns of Rak's location. He double-crosses Bond however, and informs Rak that Bond is on his way. Upon finding Rak, Bond is captured and brought to Burma.
In Burma, Rak is about to torture Bond with a jewel-encrusted knife, but is suddenly called away to deal with urgent matters. Bond takes this opportunity to escape, hunt Rak down again, and finally eliminate him. Before his death, Rak informs Bond that he was actually working for someone, stating that he'll offer up who hired him to have the scientist kidnapped in the first place if Bond spares his life, but Bond refuses the offer, as the knife Rak used to torture his victims was encrusted in the same jewels used by Nicole Hunter in her fashion-line.
Bond hunts down Nicole and interrogates her, learning that she, too, was working for a higher organization as a double agent. Nicole says she did it to prove herself to the unknown powerful head of the organization, who she claims is bigger than any organization in the world, including MI6. However, before Bond is able to interrogate her further, an unmanned drone passes by shoots Nicole dead. With no further cues to follow, Bond reports to M, advising her to find a new contact in Monaco, before departing.
Due to the game's intended sequel being cancelled, the identify of the man Nicole was describing at the end of the game was never revealed. However, with the release of Spectre in 2015 and the reveal that the villains of Craig's previous 3 films were all agents of SPECTRE; many have retroactively speculated that the person Nicole was referring to was Ernst Stravro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE. However, this is highly unlikely to be the case considering MGM didn't regain the rights to SPECTRE and Blofeld until 2013, 3 years after the game was released. 
The game was hinted on April 21, 2010, when a British retailer listed ""Blood Stone"". Two days later Activision was later registering a domain name called bloodstonethegame.com. The game was officially announced on July 16 later that year.
James Bond film writer Bruce Feirstein was chosen to pen the story for the game. The game itself is built on developer Bizarre Creations' Bespoke engine, which was first created for the game The Club. Ben Cooke, who is Daniel Craig's stunt double in the films, has provided the motion capture choreography for Bond's digital animation. He is credited as the game's stunt coordinator.
Joss Stone provides the main title introduction song with an original soundtrack called ""I'll Take it All"".
Blood Stone is a third-person shooter game similar to games like Uncharted, Gears of War and Splinter Cell and with an elements of stealth, similar to Splitner Cell: Conviction, Blood Stone has a ""Focus Aim"" system that lets you accurately shoot enemy which is unlocked by taking an enemy with melee combat.

50,/wiki/Baron_Sharck,"""S""Baron Sharck, also known as Commissar Sharkface, was a fictional German intelligence operative who spied on behalf of the Soviet Union. The character served as the primary antagonist of the James Bond comic strip, Trouble Spot, which ran in The Daily Express newspapers between December 28, 1971 and June 10, 1972.
During the Second World War, Baron Sharck served as a trusted adviser in Adolf Hitler's Reich. Unbeknownst to the Germans, the baron was secretly an intelligence operative spying on behalf of the Soviet Union. After the fall of Berlin in May 1945, he joined the Red Army; gaining him the moniker, ""Commissar Sharkface"". Some time later, Sharck was tasked with recovering a box containing the skull of double-agent, Piotr Vassilyevitch Grigorov. Grigorov had been spying for the West when he was executed by the Soviets and, in a bid to continue feeding misinformation into the West via Grigorov's pipeline, Sharck was dispatched to recover any evidence of his demise.
The skull was obtained by a spy named Mike Channing, who left the item with his wife in California before he was killed in a car crash en route to the French Riviera. Channing was subsequently impersonated by James Bond, who had also been sent to retrieve the Box. Initially believing Bond to be Channing, Sharck (as ""S"") made contact with him and secretly arranged for the kidnapping of the dead man's girlfriend, Gretta. However, he quickly recognised 007 and attempted to extract the location of the Box from him by threatening to torture the girl. Bond escaped with her and they followed the trail to Belluna, California - closely followed by Sharck.
Shadowing him and unsuccessfully attempting to co-opt 007's assistance, the baron's men planted a tracking device on Bond's car after he made contact with Channing's wife. Sharck and his men followed the group to an excavation site on the coast and were waiting a top the cliff when Bond emerged from a cave with the prize. A long standoff ensued, culminating in the fatal shooting of Gretta. After Sharck radioed for a napalm-equipped helicopter to break the standoff, Bond caused a distraction and hijacked a nearby power shovel; scooping up the baron's car and knocking the helicopter from the sky with its boom arm. Both vehicles were consumed by napalm, violently exploded and toppled over the edge of the cliff. All occupants died in the conflagration.

While in Italy she also became Emilio Largo's mistress whom she calls a ""guardian"" of no relation.
Bond meets Domino while in Nassau. She is staying on Largo's yacht, the Disco Volante, and believes Largo is in the area on a treasure hunt. For reasons she does not understand Largo makes her stay on land while he and his partners (whom she describes as shareholders) go prospecting for the hidden treasure. She also tells Bond that she has never been able to see the map that they use.
Although Bond is successful in engaging Domino in conversation, she snubs him, but later agrees to meet with him again when she returns to land. She also becomes testy when Bond uses her given name, Dominetta, and bluntly tells him to call her 'Domino'. When Bond and Domino meet again at the casino later, she has entirely changed. She tells Bond that she is tired of watching Largo show off and letting him use her. She explains to Bond that she is trapped like a bird in a gilded cage.
Domino ultimately escapes as Largo attempts to carry out his plan. During a battle with Bond, while he is focused on 007, she appears behind him and shoots him in the neck with a harpoon from a spear gun, avenging her brother and for what he had previously done to her.

57,/wiki/Carver_Media_Group_Network,"The CMGN started off as a newspaper enterprise owned by Carver's biological father, Lord Roverman. Upon finding out from his adoptive parents that he was the true heir to the Roverman fortune, Carver set out to claim what was rightfully his. Gathering embarrassing and incriminating evidence (in the novelisation, of his biological father's sexual fantasies), Carver blackmailed Roverman into suicide but not before having him rewrite his will to suit Carver's desires. After winning a lengthy court battle with Roverman's wife and daughter, Carver successfully acquired all of Roverman's assets. Branding the company under his own image and having prior experience with the tabloid and broadcasting industries during his youth in Hong Kong, Carver expanded into many media ventures such as news, television, film, print and radio industries, even using his own newspaper ""Tomorrow"" to detail events of danger and outrage for ratings.
Unknown to the public, CMGN is responsible for many scandals that they report to the world for ratings. This was shown during a meeting between Carver and his executives about their business adventures, with Jeff Hobbs reporting of ""floods in Pakistan, riots in Paris, and a plane in California"" that they set up, Philip Jones reporting that he's got all the new Carver software filled with bugs so that customers will be forced to pay for upgrades for years, and Tom Wallace agreeing to blackmail the U.S. President in signing a bill lowering cable rates by threatening to doctor and release a video of him with a cheerleader in the Chicago hotel room - and having said tape released anyway after the signing.
It wasn't until 1997 when Carver decides to provoke a war between England and China, as the Chinese government refused to sell their broadcasting rights to CMGN, making them the only country to refuse Carver's broadcasting rights. To that end, Carver employs a corrupt Chinese general named Chang, who sold him stealth material to create a stealth boat. Using the stealth boat (commandeered by Richard Stamper and Captain Scott) Carver arranged for the sinking of a British frigate, HMS Devonshire, and the murder of all its crew, Scott even ordered a missile on one of the Chinese MIGs to pin the blame of the attack on the Chinese Air Force. Carver also arranges for Henry Gupta to use a stolen American GPS encoder to intercept and erase the ship's current location from the GPS system in order for Scott and his divers to steal a large missile from the sunken ship.
With the brink of war at hand, Carver takes the opportunity to host his network's celebratory launch in Hamburg, but this wasn't the case when James Bond sabotaged the broadcast by causing a blackout in the studio, causing great embarrassment to Carver. After catching on to Bond's occupation as a secret agent and learning that his own wife Paris had a relationship with him, Carver arranges for Dr. Kaufman to kill the young woman in hopes to draw Bond out and pin the blame on him, though this failed when Bond angrily kills Kaufman, by forcing the assassin to shoot himself in the head with his own gun, in revenge for Paris' death.
After recovering the stolen decoder for the Americans, Bond soon learns that Carver is planning to launch the stolen missile into Beijing, which will start off World War III, between Britain and China, and that the CMGN is planning to make a profit by covering the event with their media resources. Around the same time, Chinese agent Wai Lin takes wind of Chang's allegiance with Carver and comes to the same conclusion, learning that Chang will take over the Chinese government and grant the CMGN broadcasting rights for the next hundred years.
Working together, Bond and Lin send messages about the CMGN's true plot to their governments before tracing down the stealth boat's previous location at Ha Long Bay, where they took down many of Carver's men to their deaths. After killing Carver, Bond implanted detonators on the missile before escaping with Lin, killing a pinned Stamper and destroying the stealth boat in the process.
It can be implied that the CMGN would be put under investigation and presumably be shut down due to Carver's plot being exposed and foiled, tarnishing its reputation as a direct result.

58,/wiki/Elektra%27s_Estate,"Elektra's Estate was a fictional villa owned by billionaire oil heiress Elektra King in The World is Not Enough.
Elektra owns this property in Baku, Azerbaijan. Since she identifies more with her maternal Azerbaijani heritage, she prefers to stay here rather than in the familie's Scottish home, Glen Darrock Estate.
Although the house for sure has plenty of rooms, the bedroom is the most prominent one, as it appears three times during the movie. It is a large, luxurious room, with green walls, completed by golden decorations. One door leads to the hallway, while the other one leads to Elektra's study.
Apart from the large bed, there is a small table located in the middle of the room, with photographs of her ancestors on it.
Located right next to her bedroom, Elektra has a small study, with access to a balcony.
The stairs leading up to Elektra's bedroom originate from a hall. Little is seen, but a piano is visible.
A large garden area belongs to the villa. Near the main entrance (Davidov is able to go there by car), an unspectacular barrack has been set up, serving as a office for security guards.
The gardens are very large, and feature some hedgemazes. The whole compound is patroled by guards armed with submachine guns and dogs.
Exterior views of the estate show Küçüksu Palace, located in the Beykoz neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey. The same building is also visible in the background in From Russia with Love. Unlike in the movie, this Otoman era building (completed in 1857) was used as an excursion palace, and not for overnight stays.
Interior scenes were filmed at Luton Hoo Estate, Bedfordshire. The building was completed in 1767. Never Say Never Again was also filmed here.

64,/wiki/Franz_Sanchez_(Robert_Davi),"El Patrón (The Boss)Founder and head of the Sanchez CartelFranz Sanchez was a fictional powerful and ruthless Central American drug baron who heads a powerful Central American criminal cartel. He was responsible for the maiming of Felix Leiter and the death of his wife triggering the anger of James Bond. The main antagonist in the 1989 James Bond film, Licence to Kill, he was portrayed by American actor, Robert Davi, and also appeared in John Gardner's accompanying novelisation. Still portrayed by Davi, the character would later be re-imagined for Activision's 2012 James Bond video game, 007 Legends.
Franz Sanchez is a Mexican drug lord running his own empire from the fictitious Republic of Isthmus. Owner of a large luxury estate, protected by an army of henchmen and controller of the city President, Sanchez has either bribed, intimidated or killed most of the government’s officials. Heading an international drugs cartel Sanchez is both ruthless and merciless, yet is cultured, refined and a man of his word. Sanchez rewards loyalty but promises death to anyone who double-crosses him. With paranoid tendencies relating to the loyalty of his men, James Bond is able to exploit this weakness to manipulate Sanchez into killing several of his own men; convincing him of their disloyalty.
Prompted to leave the safety of his lair by the betrayal of his mistress, Lupe Lamora, Sanchez traveled to the Bahamas with his enforcers; catching her in bed with another man, Alvarez. Ordering Dario to cut out the man's heart as an ironic gesture, Sanchez then severely whips her with the tail of a stingray. As Sanchez makes his way back to the nearby airfield, he is intercepted by a DEA team comprised of Felix Leiter and James Bond (ostensibly, as an ""observer""). Amid the chaos, Sanchez takes to the air in a stolen Beechcraft 18 and sets course for Cuba. The agents pursue him by helicopter and hook his aircraft in mid-flight, taking him into custody. During Sanchez's transportation to a prison, DEA agent Ed Killifer succumbs to a $2 million dollar bribe and assists the drug lord's escape by driving the prison van into the sea. Scuba divers sent by Sanchez's associate, Milton Krest, then help them make their underwater escape. Meanwhile, his henchmen Dario, Perez and Braun ambush Leiter and his wife Della on the night of their wedding. After repaying Killifer for his loyalty, Sanchez enacts his vengeance on Leiter by having him dunked into a shark tank at Ocean Exotica. When Bond returns to Leiter's house to find Della dead (and it is implied, raped) and Felix alive, but seriously wounded, he swears to take his revenge on Sanchez. Consequently, Bond boards the Wavekrest – a ship owned by Krest – and foils the kingpin's latest drug shipment, stealing five million dollars in the process.
After maiming Leiter, Sanchez is smuggled back to safety in Isthmus, where he acquires four Stinger missiles from the Contras and threatens to shoot down an American airliner if the DEA refuses to back off. He meets with five Asian drug lords as part of his goal of expanding his cocaine empire to incorporate the Pacific region; offering each of the men exclusive franchises in his narcotic product, priced at one million US dollars per territory. Unaware that one of the men is actually a Hong Kong narcotics agent, he reluctantly agrees to takes them on a tour of his main distribution centre. Bond has also traveled to Isthmus on the trail of Sanchez, and after making some winnings in the kingpin's Isthmus casino, he approaches him seeking employment in his organization (introducing himself as a ""problem eliminator""). After reconnoitering the establishment, Bond notes that Sanchez is well protected, sitting behind two inches of armored glass. Using plastic explosives, 007 attempts to demolish the window and snipe the drug lord from an adjacent building site. Despite detonating the explosives, two Hong Kong Narcotics officers foil Bond's assassination attempt and take him to their safe house for questioning. Attacking the building with a tank, Sanchez and the Isthmian militia inadvertently rescue Bond and kill the officers, believing them to be the assassins.
Now ingratiated with Sanchez and nursed back to health at his private villa, Bond sets about destroying his operation by turning him against his own employees. Taking advantage of Franz's paranoia (with the aid of informant Pam Bouvier, Q and Lupe Lamora) Bond frames Krest by placing the five million dollars he had stolen into a hyperbaric chamber on board the Wavekrest. A furious Sanchez traps Krest in the chamber and then rapidly depressurizes it with an axe, killing him gruesomely. When Perez asks about the money, Sanchez just tells him to launder it. For Bond's perceived loyalty, Sanchez admits him into his inner circle and takes him to the narcotics refinery along with the Orientals. Bond learns that Sanchez's scientists can dissolve cocaine in gasoline and then sell it disguised as fuel to Asian drug dealers. The buying and selling are conducted via the televangelist Professor Joe Butcher, working under orders from Sanchez's business manager Truman-Lodge. Four tanker trucks loaded with the mixture were prepared for the drug lords (pending their agreement). However, during the presentation Dario recognizes Bond and betrays him to Sanchez. Bond starts a fire in the laboratory and attempts to flee, but is captured, bound by the hands and feet, and placed on a conveyor belt that drops brick-cocaine into a giant shredder.
While being fed along the conveyor belt, Bond directs Sanchez's paranoid attention to his head of security, Heller's absence during the fire, stating ""That's the last you'll see of Heller and your Stingers"". The drug lord finds Heller in the middle of moving the Stingers from his helicopter and tells him to move the Stingers to his car, whilst exchanging a knowing glance at his enforcer Braun. Shortly thereafter, Heller is impaled on the forks of a forklift. Sanchez flees as the fire consumes the facility, taking with him the four articulated tankers; pursued by Bond and Bouvier in a light aircraft. During the course of the chase through the desert, three of the four tankers are destroyed, sending the cartel's profits up in smoke. Sanchez resorts to wastefully using the Stingers against 007, remarking ""Don't worry. It's only money"". Having failed to kill him, he personally attacks Bond aboard the final remaining tanker, accidentally severing the break line with a machete; causing it to veer out of control and crash down a hill side. Bloodied and soaked in petrol from the leaking tanker, Sanchez raises his blade to kill Bond, lamenting that he ""could have had everything"" by working under him rather betraying him. The incapacitated agent asks ""don't you want to know why?"", revealing his cigarette lighter – the Leiters' gift for being the best man at their wedding – and ignites Sanchez's clothing, showing that Bond wants vengeance. Burning, Sanchez stumbles into the wrecked tanker causing a violent explosion which kills him, avenging Felix and Della.
Franz Sanchez also appears in the video game 007 Legends which takes its inspiration from the final act of Licence to Kill. In it, Sanchez is an infamous drug dealer operating out of Mexico and ruling over a vast criminal empire that stretches from North America down into Chile and Argentina; from the poppy fields of Afghanistan, to cocaine processing facilities in Colombia, and counterfeit goods and money laundering in Egypt. Sanchez was drawn to the drug trade from an early age, first raw material production, then refinement and shipping until he eventually became a dealer himself. His ruthless business ethic led him to the top and he now commands the largest drugs cartel in all of Central and South America; cultivating successful business partnerships with gangs from the far east, Russia and central Eurasia. Infamously purchasing information and favor from government officials at a price of one million US dollars, his legitimate business interests include owning a bank in his native Colombia and a casino in the Mexican city of Chihuahua.
Prior to the events of 007 Legends, Sanchez brutally maims James Bond's friend, Felix Leiter, feeding him to a shark and murdering his wife Della. In a flashback sequence, Bond visits Leiter at home, discovering the carnage and pummeling one of Sanchez's thugs. Leiter provides the spy with a cigarette lighter containing intelligence on Sanchez and tells him to warn one of his agents, Pam Bouvier. The pair team up and infiltrate Sanchez's operation; with Bouvier claiming to defect from the DEA, returning $2 million of Sanchez's money the agency had recently seized from a cartel courier. Meanwhile, 007 is officially tasked by MI6 with investigating the drug lord's close ties to a shadowy faction of terrorists based out of the middle east. Operating an enormous narcotics refinery under the cover of an old Otomi temple, Sanchez shows Pam around the laboratories whilst 007 gathers evidence of arms smuggling and plants explosives around the complex. The drug lord discovers her covert listening device, blowing her cover and forcing 007 to detonate the explosives; knocking Sanchez unconscious and pinning Pam under wreckage. Introducing himself to the kingpin as 'a friend of Leiter', Bond beats him before being tackled by his enforcer, Dario. Taking advantage of the chaos, Sanchez flees in a gasoline tanker loaded with his cocaine mixture. Bond and Bouvier pursue him, eventually boarding the tanker and brawling until the vehicle veers out of control and crashes. Staggering through the wreckage, the pair fight until 007 gains the upper hand - knocking him to the ground and hurling Leiter's cigarette lighter at the gasoline-doused drug lord.

All were scheduled for execution, with Chernov organising a fitting death for his respected foe, 007: he would be hunted around the Estate by a team of four murderous Soviet inmates code-named ""Robinsons"". He was preparing to personally conduct the executions when Bond returned to the Villa triumphant, having killed all four assassins and Wagen. The KGB officer was offered a temporary reprieve by the arrival of Inspector Murray, who briefly held 007 at gunpoint before being shot dead by the spy's dart-firing pen gun. Chernov was subsequently shackled and flown to London for interrogation by the Secret Intelligence Service.

69,/wiki/Daily_Express,"The Daily Express is a tabloid newspaper that began publication in 1900, with a Sunday edition under the name ""The Sunday Express"" was launched in 1918. In 1958, the paper began to run a comic strip based based on the James Bond property, written by Anthony Hern, Henry Gammidge, Peter O'Donnell and Jim Lawrence over the run of the series. The series was illustrated by John McLusky and Yaroslav Horak. Starting in 1958 and continuing to 1983, 007 appeared in 52 comic strips that were syndicated in British newspapers, 7 of which were published abroad.
In 1957 the Daily Express, a newspaper owned by Lord Beaverbrook, approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips. Ian Fleming at the time was reluctant to allow this because he felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing and could potentially hurt his series while he was still authoring them. Ian Fleming wrote:
Regardless, Fleming later agreed and the first strip Casino Royale was published in 1958. The story was adapted by Anthony Hern who had previously serialized Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia with Love for the Daily Express. The illustrations of the strip were done by John McLusky who would later go on to illustrate 12 more James Bond comic strips with partner Henry Gammidge until 1966.
To aid the Daily Express in illustrating James Bond, Ian Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of what he believed James Bond to look like. John McLusky, however, felt that Fleming's 007 looked too ""outdated"" and ""pre-war"" and thus changed Bond to give him a more masculine look.
The majority of the early strips were adapted by Henry Gammidge, however the adaptation of Dr. No was handled by Peter O'Donnell, a couple of years before he launched his legendary strip, Modesty Blaise.
In 1962 the Daily Express abruptly cancelled their agreement with Ian Fleming when a dispute between Lord Beaverbrook and Fleming erupted over the rights to the short story The Living Daylights. Fleming had sold the rights to the Sunday Times, a rival newspaper which upset Beaverbrook to the point of terminating his relationship with Fleming. The dispute caused the comic strip adaptation of Thunderball to come to an abrupt end. Thunderball was actually never finished; however, a few additional panels were later added for syndication in other newspapers to expand and conclude the story. Lord Beaverbrook and Ian Fleming would later work out their differences and the comic strip serial would continue in 1964 with On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
In 1966 Yaroslav Horak replaced John McLusky as the artist for the Daily Express comic strip series and adapted six more Ian Fleming James Bond novels and short stories as well as Kingsley Amis' Colonel Sun with partner Jim Lawrence. The Living Daylights was also republished in the Daily Express after first appearing in the first edition of the Sunday Times magazine on February 4, 1962 and in the American magazine Argosy in June of the same year under the title ""Berlin Escape.""
In 1977 the Daily Express discontinued their series of Bond comic strips, although Horak and Lawrence went on to write and illustrate several other James Bond adventures for syndication abroad in Europe, for the Sunday Express (the Sunday edition of the Daily Express), and the Daily Star. Additionally, John McLusky returned to team up with Jim Lawrence for five comic strips.
The 1983 strip Polestar was abruptly terminated by the Daily Star midway through its run and was not completed, although the complete story did appear in non-UK newspapers and was followed by several more complete serials before the James Bond comic strip officially came to an end.
Since first publication in the Daily Express, the comic strip adaptations have been reprinted several times. First by the James Bond 007 International Fan Club, in the early 1980s. Then annually, from 1987 to 1990, by the British Titan Books company in anthologies, beginning with The Living Daylights to tie-in with the release of the eponymous James Bond film.
Beginning in 2004, Titan reissued these anthologies in larger, revised editions, and also began reprinting stories that hadn't been featured in the earlier books. With a more frequent publishing schedule than the first series, to date seven books have been released with more scheduled. These volumes include new introductory chapters on the history of the strip and the Bond novels, and most of the books have also included special introductions written by Bond film actors, specifically Caroline Munro (The Spy Who Loved Me), George Lazenby (OHMSS), Shirley Eaton (Goldfinger), Eunice Gayson (Dr. No), Roger Moore (Casino Royale), Maud Adams (Octopussy) and Britt Ekland (Colonel Sun). Titan's comic strip reprints were not initially published in the strips' original publication order; this changed as of the release of the The Spy Who Loved Me volume.
The Harpies, included in The Spy Who Loved Me, is the first non-Fleming-based Bond comic strip to be reprinted as well as the first original story. River of Death, in the Colonel Sun collection, is the second original story to be published (Colonel Sun itself being an adaptation of the first post-Fleming Bond novel). The Golden Ghost, announced for an April 2006 release, is the first collection comprising all-original stories. By 2011 they had released each of the Daily Express strips in paperback form, and in 2015 they began to publish the strips based upon Fleming's work in large hardcover editions.

The original soundtrack was once again composed by John Barry. This was the sixth time he had composed music for a James Bond film.
Bond producer Harry Saltzman reportedly hated the song because he felt the lyrics (written by lyricist Don Black) were ""too dirty.""
The title song was later sampled by Chicago rapper Kanye West for a single titled ""Diamonds from Sierra Leone.""
Tracks 1-12 were first released on vinyl in 1971. When the soundtrack was remastered on compact disc, nine previously unreleased tracks were added (13-21).

71,/wiki/Alexander_Mayhew,"Alexander Mayhew was a fictional property manager employed by nuclear decommissioning company Phoenix International. Voiced by English actor Ian Abercrombie, the character served as an antagonist and ally in Electronic Arts' 2002 James Bond video-game 007: Nightfire.
Responsible for managing Phoenix International's Japanese properties, Mayhew was intimately involved in the organisation's scheme for world domination, dubbed ""Operation Nightfire"". He was responsible for procuring a vital component of the project – a missile guidance chip for the U.S. Space Defense Platform. The handover of the stolen chip, held during a lavish cover party at Rafael Drake's Austrian castle, was an unmitigated disaster. British and American agents James Bond and Zoe Nightshade interrupted the exchange and stole back the chip. Drake subsequently threatened to kill Mayhew, whom he held responsible for the breach of security. Fearing for his safety, Mayhew contacted the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6), offering them vital information in exchange for protection and extraction by 007. Shortly afterwards, Mayhew's Japanese estate was assaulted by Phoenix-affiliated Yakuza; secretly assisted by his treacherous bodyguard Makiko Hayashi. After escorting Mayhew to a hidden safe room, Bond fought his way through the estate, cleaning up loose ends, rescuing Mayhew's servants, and obtaining a valuable file from his safe. As they attempted to escape from the estate, Mayhew was cut down by an assassin. The file subsequently led Bond to incriminating evidence Mayhew's office in the Tokyo Phoenix Building.

73,/wiki/A_View_to_a_Kill:_The_Computer_Game,"Domark created an action game split into three separate sections, inspired by scenes from the film. The game starts with the famous movie intro sequence of the moving gunsight and Bond shooting towards the camera.
In the first section set in Paris, James Bond commandeers a taxi to follow May Day who has parachuted from the Eiffel Tower. Roadblocks and police cars are out to stop Bond, who can shoot his pistol at them to get them out of the way. The display is in three sections - an overhead map of Paris, a small 3D view from the car's point of view, and a scanner showing May Day's height. James must arrive at the right location to catch her as she lands.
In the second section, James must help Stacey Sutton escape from San Francisco City Hall, which is on fire. Each room is displayed from a side-on perspective. James must collect useful objects to get through the floors of the building, such as keys to open doors and buckets of water to stop the progress of the fire.
In the third and final section, James must collect the code numbers to stop the detonation of Zorin's bomb. Bond runs around the mine, avoiding rockfalls and long drops. Among the objects he can pick up are a grapnel gun (to fire ropes upward which he can climb to safety) and a plank of wood to bridge gaps. May Day is also somewhere in the mine.
"
74,/wiki/Boris_Grishenko,"Boris Ivanovich Grishenko (In Russian: Борис Иванович Грищенко) was a fictional Russian computer technician at the GoldenEye control center in Severnaya, Siberia. He appeared as henchman to Alec Trevelyan in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye and was portrayed by Scottish actor Alan Cumming. The character also appeared in John Gardner's accompanying novelization and in 1997 video game adaptation.
Boris Grishenko worked at the Severnaya observatory in Siberia which watched over the two weapons satellites, Petya and Mischa. He is first seen helping fellow programmer Natalya Simonova get into a programme by using a perverse female password much to another fellow programmer Anna Nishkov's disgust, especially when she sees a perverted cartoon likeness of herself on the screen. She scoffs at his boorish attitude, remarking ""He wouldn't know woman if one came up and sat on his head,"" much to Natalya's amusement.
Another program Boris made was to triangulate on the origin of an outside program, he hacked into the US Department of Defense. Boris finished it to the FBI by sending a spike, with a message ""Better luck next time, slugheads.""
Later, Boris disappeared when he was ""going for a cigarette"" and was never seen again. He had actually slipped away and flew off with General Arkady Ourumov and Xenia Onatopp, having allied himself with them and Alec Trevelyan, head of Janus to steal the GoldenEye satellite, but not before Xenia massacred multiple Severnaya employees and activated a satellite to fire on Severnaya as ""target practice"" in electromagnetic warfare. This succeeded, as the Severnaya facility was destroyed. A Russian airbase a few hundred kilometers away was alerted that Severnaya was under attack, and deployed three fighter jets to intercept the attackers. The electromagnetic pulse had killed the fighter pilots as well, with one jet crashing into the satellite dish.
Natalya was the sole survivor of the Severnaya massacre, as she had hid herself in a cupboard which had shielded her from the radiation and ensuing debris. Believing Boris to be innocent and of good fortune to have excused himself for a smoke prior to the carnage, she shouted for Boris, believing him to be in the area (unaware he was spirited away by Ourumov).
Ourumov later reports to the Russian Defense Minister Dmitri Mishkin, passing off Grishenko as a lucky survivor. Natalya, still also under the impression that Grishenko was lucky to have survived, attempts to contact him via email. After telling him that Ourumov shot everyone at the bunker, Boris tells her to meet him at a nearby church and to trust no one. At the church, Boris lets Onatopp capture Natalya.
After saving Natalya and killing Ourumov, James Bond does not know how to locate Alec's base. By accessing the computer inside the train Natalya manages to hack inside Boris' network. Although Boris tries to rip out his servers, Natalya finds out that the base is at Cuba.
At the base, Trevelyan tells Boris to heave the base out of the lake. Boris claims that he is not ready but Trevelyan angrily urges him to do it anyway. After the base has emerged, Trevelyan hands Boris the GoldenEye master control key, threateningly telling Boris that it better be working. While Boris makes the final preparations, Trevelyan is handed a tablet by one of his henchman and watches footage of Bond and Natalya sneaking onto the base. He sends his men to deal with Bond and orders Boris to have the GoldenEye satellite target London, as they activate the weapon. Eventually, Bond and Natalya are captured and brought before Alec. Boris is delighted to see Natalya, but she furiously slaps him and continues to attack until she is restrained by guards. He picks up Bond's explosive pen that had fallen to the ground and starts to click it. Natalya tells him of her disgust by his betrayal and that millions of people may die because of his sick games.
He furiously raises a clenched fist to her face, but Trevelyan stops him and sends Boris back to his computer to check whether Natalya has done any harm hacking before she was captured. Big-mouthed, Boris brags that Natalya does not have his skills and would be unable to hack into the GoldenEye. Boris' overconfidence is misplaced, as soon thereafter the alarms are activated, with Boris now stating that GoldenEye is about to re-enter Earth's atmosphere which would cause the satellite to ignite and explode, in twelve minutes' time. Boris tries to hack back into the system, viciously clicking the pen, whilst Bond counts the many times it is clicked, knowing that three clicks arm its grenade, whilst three more disarm it. Bond senses an opportunity and knocks the pen from Boris' hand which falls near the gasoline canister, causing it to blow up. Fuelled by the gasoline and the explosive charge Bond set earlier, the explosion destroys almost the entire control room. However, Boris' computer equipment survives. Alec dispatches a guard to kill Boris if he fails to break Natalya's code or tries to escape, and then sets off to hunt down Bond.
Eventually, Boris manages to access the system and resets the antenna. However, Bond, who has meanwhile reached the antenna, disables the mechanism by jamming a metal bar into the rotation belts, causing grave harm to the system. This eventually results in a giant explosion that destroys the remainder of the base and kills Trevelyan. Miraculously, Boris survives. Emerging from the ruins, he loudly exclaims that he's invincible. But he celebrates too soon as at the same moment, the canisters behind him that contain liquid nitrogen explode, covering and freezing Boris to death.
Boris was a featured character in the 1997 video game Goldeneye 007 for the Nintendo 64. He could be one of the eight main characters played in the multiplayer mode. He was featured in two stages. The first stage was the second mission, or Bond's first trip to Severnaya (a main difference from the film is that Bond never went to Severnaya). In the first stage he is known as ""Programmer"" and ""Boris"" in the second stage. Bond is ordered to capture Boris in Severnaya, then force Boris to disable the security so MI6 can hack the Severnaya database. (Boris dying or fleeing the Severnaya facility before Bond captures him would result in a failed mission.) If Bond succeeds at capturing Boris, he will do as Bond commands, however his tampering with the mainframe will sound the alarm, resulting in Bond having to fight multiple Soviet soldiers, although the mission will be successful.
Boris is mentioned again in the Train level, when Natalya tries to use the computer in Trevelyan's dining car to track him to Cuba. Boris makes his second and final appearance in Trevelyan's base, feigning innocence to Bond before attempting to pull a gun on him. Being utterly incompetent in firearms, Boris fumbles and drops it. He begs for his life, saying Trevelyan made him do it and then runs away shouting his catchphrase when Bond's back is turned. As in Severnaya, killing Boris results in mission failure; Natalya, still unaware of the depth of Boris' treachery, will refuse to help Bond further if he kills him, claiming that Boris was only a pawn of Trevelyan's and did not deserve death. In order for the mission to succeed, Bond must allow Boris to flee.
Though a brilliant computer programmer, Boris was also known to be perverse and perverted mostly by the way he used female body parts as his access codes and passwords and also shown to be full of arrogance and self-confidence especially when he shouted ""I am invincible"" whenever he succeeded in finishing a task.
He later became a backstabbing traitor having sided with Janus to steal a dangerous electronic satellite that was used to murder his fellow programmers at Severnaya to leave no witnesses of the theft.
He was shown to be friends with Natalya who saw him just as an annoying little brother and was a bit more patient with his wayward antics, but then her friendship with him turned to hatred when she realised he was partly responsible for the murder of Anna and all the other people at the Severnaya observatory as well as him being willing to kill more people for personal profit.
Perhaps because of his ego, Boris became somewhat unstable when he was confronted with a problem he couldn't solve.  When Natalya changed the codes to lock him out of the computer, he insisted he could fix it himself; when he failed to do so, he screamed in her face, demanding her codes.  Later, when the satellite, dish failed to respond to his commands (because Bond had sabotaged it), Boris devolved into manhandling the computer screen and screaming incoherently.

In the room, they discover an envelope containing a key for a safety deposit box at the bank where Suzuki worked. Haven drives 007 to the bank, where they investigate Suzuki's workspace, while a locksmith attempts to fix the broken deposit box lock. The locksmith accidentally triggers a bomb in the locker meant for Bond, and emerging from the building the pair notice a suspicious bag lady; who promptly flees by car.
The spies commandeer a taxi and pursue the felons to a Macy's warehouse. Bond sends her to phone for help, while he attempts to gain entry to the building; getting caught in the process. It is revealed that the 'bag lady' and orchestrator of the bombing is actually Irma Bunt, the vengeful former-paramour of super-villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Bunt shaves Bond with a barber's razor coated with fugu poison, but is interrupted by Haven; who sneaks into the room and shoots one of her gunmen. While Cheryl holds the remaining man at gunpoint, 007 pursues Irma Bunt and shoots her dead. The spy, however, is shot in the process and is taken to hospital. Haven is there when he regains consciousness and the story concludes with her seducing him.

89,/wiki/Attach%C3%A9_case,"An attaché case is a box-style briefcase made of leather, scrunched over a hinged frame that opens into two compartments. It was traditionally carried by an attaché, a diplomatic officer attached to an embassy or consulate officially assigned to serve in a particular capacity (e.g., cultural attaché; military attaché). An attaché case crafted by British luxury luggage manufacturer Swaine Adeney Brigg (and subsequently modified by Q Branch) was prominently featured in Ian Fleming's 1957 novel From Russia with Love and later in its 1963 film adaptation. Attaché cases would also play a role in the 2005 video game adaptation.
Weighing in at 8 lbs (3.6 kg), Q Branch ripped out the careful handiwork of Swaine and Adeney to pack fifty rounds of .25 ammunition, in two flat rows, between the leather and the lining of the spine. In each of the sides there was a flat throwing knife, built by Wilkinsons and the tops of their handles were concealed by the stitching at the corners. The handle of the case hid a compartment containing a cyanide death-pill, triggered by pressure at a certain point. Its lid contained fifty golden sovereigns, which could be poured out by slipping sideways one ridge of welting. Inside the case was a thick tube of Palmolive shaving cream, whose top unscrewed to reveal the silencer for 007's Beretta 418, packed in cotton wool.
The case first makes its appearance in Chapter 13 of Ian Fleming's 1957 novel From Russia with Love. Whilst aboard B.E.A. Flight 130 to Rome, Athens and Istanbul, 007 reaches for the case and takes out a copy of the 1939 novel The Mask of Dimitrios by Eric Ambler. Days later, after obtaining the prized Spektor decoding machine, Bond and cypher clerk Tatiana Romanova  board the Orient Express in Istanbul. En-route to Paris, Soviet assassin Red Grant gains Bond's confidence and agrees to share the guard duties in his stateroom. With Bond asleep and unarmed he allows his identity to be known and a confrontation between the pair occurs. Pretending to be fatally shot, Bond lies motionless on the ground and feels for his attaché case, extracting one of the flat-bladed throwing-knives and plunging it into Grant. After a scuffle, Grant is shot by Bond.
In the 1963 film adaptation of From Russia with Love, the briefcase is introduced during a short scene in M's office and is almost identical to the one described in Fleming's novel. The briefcase, now standard issue among 00 agents, is demonstrated to Bond by Major Boothroyd of Q-Branch. He explains how the case functions and notes its hidden features, such as a flat throwing-knife at the top corner of the case, 20 rounds of ammunition stored in 2 cylinders hidden in its base, and fifty gold sovereigns concealed in the lining of the case (25 in either side, accessible by pulling the inside straps). Unlike its novel counterpart, the case contains an anti-tampering mechanism with a magnetized tear-gas cartridge (disguised as a tin of talcum powder). The mechanism is disarmed by turning the case's catches to a horizontal position and opening normally. Inside the case was also an Armalite AR-7 folding sniper-rifle with an infrared scope and .25 ACP ammunition.
In the subsequent film Goldfinger, reference is made to Bond having a black attaché case that is damaged (presumed destroyed) when examined by Auric Goldfinger's personnel. This may be a reference to the agent briefcase introduced in From Russia with Love, or it could have been another piece of luggage that had been rigged to self-destruct when tampered with.
Although a particular attaché case of the kind found in the novel and film adaptations does not appear in the 2005 video game From Russia with Love, the game does contain numerous locked attaché cases which, when unlocked via a controller key combination, provide useful items such as schematics for upgrading weapons and gadgets. The game also features a briefcase turret which resembles the Swaine Adeney Brigg attaché case found in the novel and film.

The character is still called Domino (however now it is no longer just a nickname) yet her last name has become Petachi, the reason for this change is unknown. Although somewhat less assertive than the Thunderball version- being clearly terrified when she is nearly sold off to a group of Arabs-, she nevertheless kills Largo and avenges her brother. The film ends with Bond retiring from the service to be with her.
Never Say Never Again marked the high-point of a long legal battle between United Artists and Kevin McClory. For more information see: the controversy over Thunderball.

91,/wiki/Fredericka_von_Gr%C3%BCsse,"Fredricka ""Flicka"" von Grüsse was a fictional intelligence operative formerly of Swiss Intelligence, and subsequently of the British Secret Intelligence Service. A recurring ally and prominent love interest, the character first appeared in John Gardner's 1993 James Bond continuation novel, Never Send Flowers, and subsequently appeared in SeaFire (1994) and COLD (1996).
She struck Bond as athletic, and as someone who would get what she wanted when she wanted it. She is overly protective of her position as Bond's lover, as she tends to get a tad macabre when Caramel Chantry is brought up, calling her a tart, subtly implying that she is promiscuous or a prostitute, and threatening to rip out her organs if she came near Bond again. She is fired from the Swiss secret service when she is expelled from a hotel during the investigation of the murder of Laura March, and later hired by MI6.

94,/wiki/Georgi_Koskov,"Lieutenant-General Georgi Koskov (Russian: Георгий Косков) was a fictional deceitful Soviet General who was in league with arms dealer Brad Whitaker. Portrayed by Dutch actor Jeroen Krabbé, the character was one of the two main antagonists (alongside Whitaker) in the 1987 James Bond film The Living Daylights. He later made an appearance in the 2000 video game 007 Racing, voiced by Alistair Abell.
Georgi Koskov is a deceitful, mastermind and sociopathic Soviet general in business for himself, who carefully plays both sides of the Cold War. Initially, Koskov gives the impression of a somewhat anxious pawn in the battle between the Soviet Union and the West, when he is, in reality, a mastermind using all means to his own advantage. He is prepared to dote on his girlfriend Kara Milovy and give her all manner of expensive gifts (the prize among which is a Stradivarius cello), but when necessary will easily sign her death warrant. He is also secretly working with American arms dealer Brad Whitaker in an illicit arms and drug deal.
Koskov fakes his own defection using Kara Milovy as a sniper to make it look real. James Bond is assigned in aiding him across the border into Austria. At a safe house in England, Koskov falsely and deliberately fingers KGB head General Pushkin as the mastermind of ""Smiert Spionem"" or ""Death to Spies,"" a plot to kill off American and British spies, but Bond suspects the truth. After Koskov is recaptured by the KGB following a raid on an MI6 safehouse after his debriefing, MI6 dispatches Bond to terminate Pushkin despite the 00 Agent's doubts.
Bond eventually discovers through his contact with Kara that defection was not Koskov's true intent, and in an attempt to lure him out, conspires with General Pushkin to fake the latter's death. Bond fakes Pushkin's assassination in Tangier just as Necros was ordered to carry out the attack himself and Koskov moves forward with his plans upon this news. He tricks Kara into incapacitating Bond and flies the two of them to Soviet-occupied Afghanistan where the two of them are to be imprisoned. Despite their eventual escape, Koskov was still left to operate freely.
It is later discovered that Koskov is misusing funds from the Soviet Union to purchase a massive supply of opium with a street value of $500 million from the local Mujaheddin drug lords in Afghanistan; he and Whitaker would then distribute the drugs through the United States and reap huge personal profit in the sales, while still buying up plenty of advanced armaments through Whitaker to bolster the Soviet occupation of the country. Intending to disrupt this exchange, Bond trails Koskov back to the airbase, where he is later rescued by his newfound Mujaheddin allies as they attack the Soviet forces. Amidst the confusion, Bond and Kara hijack the aircraft carrying Koskov's newly purchased opium supply, and make their escape despite Koskov and Necros' attempts to stop them.
Ultimately Koskov is captured by Pushkin just as Bond kills Whitaker in Tangier and is returned to his motherland under armed escort. Koskov is arrested and presumably executed off-screen by the Russian government.

A BD-5J was supplied by Q Branch during 007's mission to destroy aeronautical equipment at a Latin American air base. Intended as his escape vehicle, the tiny unarmed jet was concealed in a phoney horsebox complete with a plastic horse's hindquarters. After the mission went awry, Bond escaped from his pursuers and used the BD-5J to guide a heat-seeking surface-to-air missile into the enemy's equipment hangar - destroying the facility and its research. Running low on fuel, 007 crossed the border and landed at a ramshackle petrol filling station; nonchalantly requesting, ""Fill her up, please.""

100,/wiki/Anya,"When the British HMS Ranger and the Soviet submarine Potemkin are captured, M recalls James Bond from a mission where he is currently in a cabin located in Austria. While leaving Bond is ambushed by a Russian team lead by Sergei Barsov, but is able to kill Barsov in self-defense prior to parachuting off the mountain, unbeknownst that the agent was Amasova's lover. Later, Anya has also been recalled from a mission by General Gogol of the KGB.
Anya meets Bond during a show at the Pyramids in Egypt, where her thugs fight with Bond when she believes he has killed Aziz Fekkesh, an Egyptian contact whose body has been found in one of the pyramids. The real killer was Jaws.
However, they become formally introduced to one another in Cairo when they both arrive at Max Kalba's club. After spouting various biographical details to each other (for example, Anya is aware of Bond's doomed marriage), they attempt to outbid one another for a secret microfilm. When Kalba is killed by Jaws, they travel across Egypt tracking the microfilm. After Anya ultimately outwits Bond for the microfilm (but Bond had reviewed it), they report to the Abu Simbel temple where Gogol and M have decided to work together to find out how and why their submarines are being stolen while at sea.
For most of the film, Bond and Anya have the same mission objectives and try to achieve the same goals often by attempting to outdo one another, during which they fall in love. While travelling to Sardinia by train they share a meal together and while Anya is preparing for bed in her carriage, having politely declined Bond's offer of a nightcap, she is attacked by Jaws. Bond hears the sounds of a struggle over the noise of the train and arrives just in time to save her from being killed. After a brief fight, Jaws is dispatched out of a window and Bond returns to Anya, who tends to a cut on his shoulder before they kiss and ultimately spend the night together. On Sardinia, Anya accompanies Bond to meet Karl Stromberg posing as his wife. Afterwards, Anya learns that Bond killed her lover. She then tells him that she will ultimately have revenge once their mission is complete.
Anya is later captured by Stromberg and held captive at Atlantis, Stromberg's undersea base. Bond sneaks aboard and rescues her. As the mission reaches its end, she points her gun at Bond, only to discover that she is too in love with him to kill him.
Anya (pointing gun at Bond), tells him: ""The mission is over, Commander"". At that moment, as Anya is tightening her finger on the trigger, the cork pops off of a champagne bottle that Bond is in the process of opening. Anya smiles, stifling a giggle, and Bond says ""In my country, Major, the condemned man is usually allowed a final request"" to which she says ""Granted"". Bond then suggests that they get out of their wet clothes.
When James and Anya's escape pod goes into the ship Bond saved from Stromberg's 'instruments of Armageddon', Q, M, Fredrick Gray and Anya's superiors from Russia look inside the window at James and Anya making love in the luxury bed in awe. ""James!"" Anya says as she's the first one in the pod to see the duo's superiors.
Anya was depicted as cunning, devious, aloof and fearless. She was vengeful and became tenacious to kill James Bond after he killed her boyfriend. However, despite this, unfortunately for Sergei, she is also capable of forgiveness and letting go of these grudges as she has shown to have forgiven Bond after she realized Bond actually killed Sergei in self-defense. She is shown to have nerves of steel, since she was completely calm in holding Jaws at gunpoint.
It was planned to have Amasova make a cameo in Moonraker (which was released in 1979), as the woman in bed with General Gogol, but this never happened.

102,/wiki/Chula_(Chan_Yiu_Lam),"Chula is a fictional student in the training school of wealthy industrialist, Hai Fat. A minor antagonist portrayed by actor and martial artist, Chan Yiu Lam, the character first appeared in the 1974 James Bond film, The Man with the Golden Gun. He was subsequently adapted for the 1983-87 tabletop role-playing game, James Bond 007: Role-Playing In Her Majesty's Secret Service.
When James Bond gets sent the Kung Fu school of Hai Fat, he finds out the hard way that Chula is one of the best students, if not the best student. After watching a swordfight, Bond is instructed to take centre stage.
After 007 defeats Hassman, the master of the school chooses Chula to fight him next. Chula rises from his seat, next to the master's chair, to the sound of the other pupils, especially the white belts, chanting his name. He and Bond bow to one another, as is traditional in most martial arts, to show respect between opponents. However, after observing that this is how Bond felled Hassman, Chula does not take his eyes off Bond during the bow.
After fighting Bond for a few minutes, it seems apparent that Bond is going to lose the battle. To counter, Bond knocks Chula down and jumps out a window before begins his escape. At once, the students of the school try to capture him, only to fall victim to Hip's nieces. Chula and other senior students, however, avoid this confrontation.
Hip and his nieces drive off, so Bond makes an escape in a boat on the nearby river. Chula and other students follow him, but Bond buys some time by threatening them with the motorised pole on the boat.
After Bond races off, Chula and his crew commandeer another boat and pursue him on the river. Following a lengthy pursuit of the spy on the river, Bond races his boat over that of his pursuers, breaking the pursuers' boat and causing it to sink.
Although their boat is sunk, Chula and his crew all survive; however, their martial arts robes are ruined by the river's water. Their foul luck is observed by none other than J.W. Pepper, who ridicules their supposed dress.

103,/wiki/Gonzles%27_Henchman_1.,"Gonzales' henchman is a fictional unnamed mercenary serving under Hector Gonzales. He later takes command of Gonzales' men after his death at the hands of Melina Havelock. The minor villain appeared in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by stuntman Clive Curtis.
Handing him the PPK, Gonzales recognizes the weapon as the standard issue firearm of the British Secret Service and orders Bond to be taken away, presumably to be shot. It is at this moment that the Cuban hitman is shot in the back by Melina, who has been lurking in the woods.
In the ensuing chaos, Bond knocks one of his captors into the pool and escapes over the villa wall into the woods. The henchman manages to fire several shots at Bond, but ultimately is unable to catch him. Eventually, the spy manages to get to the relative safety of Melina's Citroën 2CV, and a car chase through the Spanish countryside ensues.
With the henchman and two cars full of mercenaries in pursuit, Bond accidentally topples the 2CV in a crowded village. As 007 and Melina (with the help of some villagers) attempt to roll the car onto its wheels, a traffic pile-up begins with a bus blocking the mercenaries' path through the cramped street. After gesturing wildly at the bus driver to reverse and clear the street, the henchman fires his pistol menacingly in the air. The threat has the desired effect, but by the time the bus has moved the 2CV is already up-righted and escaping.
Continuing the chase through winding hill roads, the henchman's car attempts to force Bond off the road twice. Although the first attempt succeeds, the second attempt fails miserably as Bond's quick braking sends the henchman's car careering into the second car behind him. The henchman's vehicle is sent tumbling down the hillside, landing on its roof on the road below. Bruised and bloodied, the henchman stares in horror as the second car hurtles around the corner, hitting the car a second time and sending its occupants spinning in circles.

Travelling under the guise of a horse trainer, Bond disguises himself as Colonel Toro (complete with a fake moustache, uniform and ID card) in order to access the facility. However, the real Toro notices 007 entering the aircraft hangar and blows his cover before he can complete his mission. Minutes later, Bianca spots Toro's paratrooper guards driving away with a captured Bond and helps free him. 007 attempts to escape in an Acrostar Bede Jet hidden in the back of his Land Rover's horse trailer and uses one of his enemies' own heat-seeking ground-to-air missiles to destroy the hangar with Toro inside.

106,/wiki/Gobinda_(Kabir_Bedi),"Gobinda is generally seen accompanying Kamal Khan wherever he goes, and performing various other duties, mainly security based. British agent James Bond first spies the tall, imposing man when Gobinda is acting as chauffeur for Khan and his henchwoman Magda in a street after the Sotheby's auction. Later in India, it is clear Gobinda means business when he destroys the rigged dice after Bond defeats Kamal in a game of backgammon at the hotel casino. Then later, he and Khan's other henchmen chase Bond and his Indian ally, Vijay, through the streets of Delhi driving tuk-tuks and try unsuccessfully to shoot 007 and Vijay. Ultimately the goon captures Bond after Magda seduces the spy and steals the real Fabergé egg. He takes the agent to stay as Kahn's 'guest' at the Monsoon Palace, where 007 finds out that Khan is working with General Orlov.
Later, Gobinda fights Bond on Octopussy's train in Germany but fails in killing him when the British falls off the train. He notices 007 when they are leaving the circus and informs Khan, who says to let their enemy keep going and that he will soon die in the explosion. However, Bond and Octopussy manage to deactivate the bomb and return to India to attack Kamal Khan. During the assault on and in Khan's palace, Octopussy gets captured by Khan and Gobinda, who escape the palace and into a plane. Bond follows them and jumps on the plane, disabling one of its engines in the process. Khan so instructs Gobinda to fight 007 atop the plane, albeit understandably with some reluctance. His reluctance was with good concern, as that was a very risky venture that ultimately led to Gobinda's doom. Bond figured he was outmatched and wing-walking makes a poor choice for a battleground. While Gobinda is attempting to grab Bond, 007 pulls back the plane's antenna and snaps it at Gobinda's head. Gobinda screams in pain due to the blistering sting of the antenna's snap, and it also causes him to loosen his arm's grip on the fuselage, causing him to fall to his death.

Arriving in the Italian ski resort of Cortina, James Bond narrowly saves the life of Melina Havelock after she is attacked by two men on motorcycles. Although Bond apparently kills one of the assassins, the second escapes. It is unknown if the fleeing cyclist was Claus or another mercenary.
Later, Bond attends a biathlon event with Aris Kristatos' protégée, Bibi Dahl. Observing Bond leave the biathlon course, and sensing an opportunity to kill him, Locque signals for Claus and his accomplice to cut him off. Meanwhile, his fellow henchman, Erich Kriegler, attempts to snipe Bond from above. Bond manages to evade Kriegler, skiing into the path of Claus. Performing a somersault leap from a mound of snow, 007 knocks Claus to the ground and, despite a flurry of small arms fire, manages to escape to the relative safety of the Olympic ski jump.
Following him, Locque and Claus enter a lift with Bond. At the top, the pair split up - Locque preventing Bond from retreating back and Claus preparing to kill him on the way down the 90-meter Olympic ski jump. At the same time, Kriegler arrives at the base of the jump and prepares to snipe Bond. With no other option available, the spy is forced to use the slope. As he begins his descent, Claus forces his way on to the jump and brawls with Bond. Both men make the jump and as they land, Bond knocks Claus off his feet and makes his escape.
Later, Claus and two other henchmen fight Bond in the hockey rink, but the three henchmen are defeated by him.
Claus makes one final appearance later in the film as he and another unnamed driver aid Locque in his attempt to murder Bond and Lisl von Schlaf. Using dune buggies, the pair drive Lisl into the path of Locque's vehicle. She is killed instantly. Seconds later, Claus clips Bond with his buggy and holds him at gunpoint. He orders him into Locque's vehicle, but never finishes his sentence; he is struck in the back by a harpoon fired by one of Milos Columbo's men.

115,/wiki/Auric_Enterprises,"Auric Enterprises, or Entreprises Auric A.G., or simply AE, is a Swiss metallurgical and engineering company owned by billionaire Auric Goldfinger. The company is the main antagonistic faction in the 1959 James Bond novel Goldfinger and its 1964 cinematographic adaptation. It later made a subsequent apparence in the 2012 Activision's video game 007 Legends as a part of a re-imagined Goldfinger storyline.
Entreprises Auric A.G. is an engineering business based in Coppet in the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Owned by Auric Goldfinger, they manufacture metal furniture for the Swiss railways and airlines such as Mecca (also owned by Goldfinger), a major charter line to India.
Entreprises Auric plays a major part in Goldfinger's gold smuggling scheme, taking the gold components of Auric's armour-plated Silver Ghost and melting them down to be modeled into chairs for Mecca aircraft. Once arriving in India, the chairs are stripped off the plane, melted down once again into gold bars and are replaced with aluminium ones, whilst the bars are sold for a much higher premium rate; netting Goldfinger close to a million pounds in profit.
Auric Goldfinger founded the company in Switzerland to engage in legitimate bullion and jewelry dealing. Unknown to the public, the enterprise is known to illegally smuggle gold throughout all of Europe, recently through Goldfinger's Rolls-Royce Phantom III vehicle, which was witnessed by James Bond.
Following Bond's capture and transport to Kentucky, Bond soon learns of Goldfinger's plot: he plans to destroy Fort Knox and supply of gold with a nuclear bomb (created by Mr. Ling). As such, Goldfinger would have to have his aviator team called the Flying Circus (led by Pussy Galore) to spray nerve gas across the area that will kill 60,000 troops so that he can lead his task force (led by Oddjob and Kisch) to transport the bomb into the vault. Once the bomb is set to go off, it will destroy Fort Knox and render the gold radioactive and useless for 58 years, thus putting the U.S. economoy in chaos and allowing the value of Auric Enterprises' gold to increase many times, thus making it the most richest company in the world.
To that end, Goldfinger gets several crime bosses (Mr. Solo, Jed Midnight and Jack Strap) to smuggle the gas and weaponry to the company as part of his plan before having them all killed to cover his tracks. Not wanting this to happen, Bond seduces Galore, convincing her to get the Flying Circus to replace the gas with a more harmless subtance while alerting the U.S. government about the plot. This allowed the U.S. Army to take down all of Goldfinger's men, including Oddjob, Kisch and Mr. Ling. Goldfinger would later meet his end after being sucked out from a plane to his death after a brief fight against Bond, and it's implied that Auric Enterprises would be shut down afterwards.
Auric Enterprises returns in the first mission of the 2012 video game 007 Legends as part of a re-imagined story based on 1964's Goldfinger. After starting an investigation into Auric Goldfinger, who MI6 believe is smuggling gold out of the United Kingdom, 007 is dispatched to infiltrate his headquarters at Auric Enterprises in Switzerland.

116,/wiki/General_Li,"Sangjang Li was a fictional North Korean military officer allied to Gustav Graves. A supporting antagonist portrayed by the late actor, Vincent Wong, the character first appeared in the 2002 James Bond film, Die Another Day, and was later seen in its accompanying novelization penned by Raymond Benson.
Along with General Dong and General Han, Li is invited over to Graves' Ice Palace for a demonstration: a new satellite called Icarus that can provide sunlight to areas of the world which lack it in order to promote agricultural development in cold climate countries. However, it turns out that Icarus was actually designed as a weapon to detonate mines placed along the De-Militarized Zone between North and South Korea, as Graves intends to create a path carved through the De-militarized zone so that all of Korea would be reunited by force under North control. To that end, Graves provides a secret demonstration to Li, Han and Dong by using the satellite to trace down and kill James Bond with a giant laser, though Bond manages to escape from being killed.
Following Graves' return to North Korea, Li helpes him and the other generals form a coup against Graves' father General Moon by putting him under house arrest. Li and the generals then watch as Graves shows Moon of his plot. However, Moon is outraged by this and grabs Han's gun in an attempt to shot Graves, only for the latter to stun him and shot him down in anger, something which Li and the other generals didn't expect. Needless to say, Bond and his NSA partner Jinx breaks into the plane just as the former accidentally fires a bullet in one of the plane's windows, causing the cabin to lose pressure. Li, along with Vlad and the generals, are blown out of the plane and fell to their deaths.

Two Chinese J-17 MiGs were dispatched to investigate the frigate's presence. Unbeknownst to both the fighter pilots and the Devonshire's crew, the frigate was being used in Carver's plot to provoke war between China and the United Kingdom in order to secure broadcasting rights in the former. Carver's Stealth Ship, undetectable by either the Devonshire or the MiGs, launched a sea drill at the frigate, which sank the craft by surgically cutting through its hull. Believing it to be an aerial torpedo fired by the MiGs, Commander Day sent a message to the Admiralty and proceeded to abandon ship.

He subsequently devoted himself to to the study of octopi, becoming a leading authority on the subject. His enthusiasm was such that he nicknamed his daughter ""Octopussy"". When her father's gold ran out, the people in Hong Kong who'd disposed of it for him offered her a commission to smuggle diamonds. Discovering that she had a talent for it, she followed in Smythe's illicit footsteps and went into business as a smuggler. Two decades after the gold affair, the corpse of Smythe's native guide was discovered, with a bullet inside his skull matching the Major's service revolver. The Service dispatched James Bond to search for Smythe, whom he tracked down to Sri Lanka. He gave Smythe 24 hours to tidy up his affairs before returning for him; during which time Smythe committed suicide rather than face the disgrace of a court martial.

122,/wiki/Hannes_Oberhauser_(Literary),"Hannes Oberhauser was an Austrian climbing and skiing instructor, later an officer in the Gestapo, and a father-like figure to James Bond. The character was first mentioned in the 1966 Ian Fleming short-story Octopussy. He was later adapted into a similar character for the 2015 James Bond film SPECTRE.
Oberhauser taught climbing and skiing in Kitzbühel before World War II. He even taught James Bond during his youth while he was on term breaks while attending Fettes College. He formed a very strong paternal relationship with James, to such an extent that he later referred to him as his second father. After the annexation of Austria and outbreak of war with Great Britain he was drafted into the Gestapo, probably due to his ability to speak English.
One day, in the closing weeks of the war, a British officer named Dexter Smythe arrived by jeep at Oberhauser's chalet and arrested him. He had told his weeping, protesting family that he was being taken to an interrogation camp in Munich. If the Oberhauser's record was clean he would be released within a week. If his family caused a drama it would just make things worse for Oberhauser.
The officer and Oberhauser drove off and Oberhauser was told that in exchange for assisting him climbing the Kaiser range, he would report to his commanding officer that he had been cleared at Munich. He guided the Englishman up the mountain to a hut where he was shot point blank in the back of the skull by the officer's Webley & Scott .45 pistol. His body was then pushed off the mountain onto a glacier below.
Twenty years later, Oberhauser's corpse was discovered by mountaineers and the case for his murder was re-opened. As serendipity had it, the case was noticed by James Bond, who set out to discover the one responsible for his friend's death.

125,/wiki/Franco,"Franco Oliveiro Quesocriado is an international terrorist leader in the 1981 James Bond novel Licence Renewed by John Gardner.
Franco was born in Madrid, Spain in 1948 to a Spanish father and an English mother. During the late 1960s, Franco was involved in the hijacking of two British passenger jets, and later operated as a planner for terrorist actions for the Baader-Meinhof Gang, later renamed the Red Army Faction. Throughout his terrorist career, he was involved with the Palestine Liberation Organization, Irish Republic Army, and a network of terrorist groups. In addition, he was connected in two political kidnappings and bomb attacks inspired by him. Eventually, Franco becomes a wanted terrorist in most European countries as well as some in the Middle East, as well as a request for him to be held in the United States.
In the novel's beginning, Franco arrives at an airport, and dons a disguise composed with dark eye contacts, a tailor-made short beard and moustache, and latex frame eye bristles. Under the disguise, he takes a flight on Aer Lingus flight EI 154 from Dublin to London Heathrow Airport. After being briefed about Franco's previous involvements, James Bond is assigned to investigate Dr. Anton Murik who is thought to be connected with Franco supposedly creating a lethal nuclear device. At Murik's Castle in Murcaldy, Bond gradually gains Murik's trust posing as a mercenary-for-hire. Later on, Murik assigns Bond to kill Franco for a sum of money.
When Bond goes into his decorative room at the Murik Castle, he equips a standard VL 22H countersurveillance receiver and headphones via a bug in Murik's study room. There, he listens on a conservation between Murik and Franco discussing their plans. Unfortunately, he is interrupted by Murik's mistress, Mary Jane Mashkin, who comes to check up on Bond. After Mary Jane leaves, Bond plays back the cassette tape only to find it muffled. Nevertheless, Bond learns that Franco and Murik are conducting at least five nuclear terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States under the codename, Operation Meltdown.
Upon learning this information, Bond goes to report this to MI6. With help from Lavender Peacock, Bond tries to escape at night, but is caught after a violent car chase resulting in the two deaths of Murik's men. Via aircraft, Murik transports Bond to Perpignan, France, where he escapes him at the airport.

He was last seen by his local contacts heading to Lima to investigate ""Paradiso Industries, Ltd."", a biomedical research and genetics firm under the control of a mysterious man going by the name ""Indigo"". While in Indigo's custody, 009's blood was taken and used in his experiments. As a part of Indigo's delusions of godhood, 009's mind and appearance were altered to resemble a Neanderthal and he was forced to act as the madman's manservant and bodyguard under the name ""Goliath"".
Bond had been against 009's being given the assignment, and his hunch that the soviets were not involved were proven viable by 009's having been killed in Peru. He was then given the assignment, and eventually tracked Indigo to his mobile Eden complex. Attempting to make Goliath stronger, Indigo gave him several injections, and the man later delivered his master drinks in bed, which he accidentally dropped into a alligator pit, to Indigo's ire. After Bond infiltrated Eden and gave chase after Indigo, Goliath confronted his former-colleague with a shotgun and was ordered to kill him. The spy recognized 009 through his mutations and begged him to remember who he was. 009 briefly regained control of his actions before being stabbed in the back and killed by Indigo.

128,/wiki/Christmas_Jones,"Dr. Christmas Jones is a fictional nuclear physicist who appeared in the 1999 James Bond film The World is Not Enough. She was portrayed by American actress and former fashion model Denise Richards.
Mid-way though the film, Bond arrives at a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan, working undercover to investigate the terrorist Renard's presence at the facility. Posing as a Russian nuclear scientist, Bond is introduced to Dr. Christmas Jones, an American nuclear physicist working in Russia to dismantle nuclear warheads, reducing the Russian inventory in line with treaty obligations. On their initial encounter Jones treats Bond with a combination of mistrust and mild contempt, pre-empting a discussion of her unusual forename with a warning not to bother with any Christmas jokes - she has apparently heard them all.
After gaining access to the silo, Bond notices Renard removing a GPS locator card and a half quantity of weapons-grade plutonium from one of the nuclear devices. Before Bond can kill him, Christmas blows his cover by pointing to an inconsistency between Bond's appearance and his age as stated on his stolen ID card. Renard steals the bomb and flees, leaving everyone to die in the booby-trapped missile silo. Bond and Christmas narrowly escape the exploding silo with the weapon's locator card.
In Azerbaijan, Bond discovers that the stolen bomb has been placed in the King oil pipeline attached to an inspection rig and is heading rapidly toward the oil terminal. Bond and Christmas enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Christmas discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig and a large section of the pipe is destroyed by the remaining explosive charge. Bond and Jones are presumed killed and the villainess, Elektra King, decides to take advantage of the opportunity and abduct M.
Meeting up with Bond's ex-KGB ally, Valentin Zukovsky, the group goes to Istanbul, where they realize that Renard is planning to insert the stolen plutonium into a submarine's nuclear reactor (the submarine would subsequently be hijacked by Elektra and was captained by Zukovsky's nephew). The resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. Elektra's pipeline is planned to go around Istanbul, dramatically increasing the value of her own oil.
After a further assassination attempt by Elektra's hired thugs, Bond and Christmas are captured. Christmas is taken aboard the submarine, which was seized by Renard's men. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a garrotte. Bond escapes with the help of Zukovsky, frees M and kills Elektra. He then dives after the submerging submarine, boards it and frees Christmas. Following a fight, the submarine starts to dive, and hits the bottom of the Bosphorus, causing its hull to rupture. Bond catches up with Renard and fights and kills him. Bond and Christmas escape the submarine, leaving the flooded reactor to detonate safely underwater. They are subsequently shown celebrating Christmas in Turkey, culminating in a romantic liaison that is unintentionally spied on by MI6 using a new body sensor designed by R, who soon turns it off, lying to M by saying it is an error likely caused by a premature form of the ""Millennium Bug"" said to occur in 2000.

131,/wiki/Greene%27s_driver,"The driverUnnamed, the character was a fictional member of the secretive criminal organization, Quantum, who served as Dominic Greene's chauffeur and bodyguard. A minor antagonist portrayed by actor, Carl von Malaisé, he appeared in the 2008 James Bond film, Quantum of Solace.
The silent bodyguard was one of several unidentified Quantum operatives who accompanied Greene to a meeting during a performance of Tosca at an opera house in Bregenz, Austria. Alongside the environmentalist's right-hand man, Elvis, he stands guard over his boss in his personal box. As James Bond compromises the meeting, the driver maintains his stoic appearances, gathering up Greene's cabal of guards and ushering them to his vehicle. As the group prepares to leave, 007 throws Guy Haines' bodyguard on Greene's car. The villain orders the driver to kill the injured man and the driver shot the bodyguard in the chest, killing him and letting Bond be framed for the murder.
Some time later the driver is seen at the Perla de las Dunas in Bolivia's Atacama Desert, where he watches over Greene's meeting with exiled dictator, General Medrano, and the corrupt Bolivian police chief in regards to their payment for Quantum's continued control of Bolivia's water supply. The calm of the meeting is however shattered by the arrival of Bond, who kills the police chief. During the ensuing shooting, Greene and Elvis attempts to evacuate to the hotel's upper floors while the driver stay behind in order to kill Bond but he scarcely proves a deterrent to the determined agent, who shoots the henchman in the stomach repeatedly with a SIG-Sauer P226, killing him. The driver's corpse is later incinerated when the hotel is destroyed.
The driver's calm nature indicated a fierce loyalty to his employer, something further demonstrated by his complete willingness to sacrifice his life to protect Greene. Despite this apparent bond to Greene, he is also shown as a borderline sociopath due to his murder of Guy Haines' bodyguard without flinching or question.

The Scorpio replaced the European Ford Granada (all pre-1990 Scorpios were sold as Granadas in the UK), and was itself replaced itself by the Scorpio Mk.II in 1994. Due to the rather tasteless design of the second generation, the Scorpio was discontinued, and there has been no executive Ford on the European market ever since.
During the parking garage chase of Tomorrow Never Dies, some of Carver's men are using a 1985-1989 Scorpio hatchback in CL or GL trim (Ghia models had different side planks). They start to chase Bond's BMW 750iL after the missiles fail to destroy the closed gate, and - just like the BMW - the Scorpio also drives over the tire spikes released by Bond earlier.
Unlike the BMW, the Scorpio's tires do not re-inflate itself, so the car chases Bond while driving on its rims, with sparks flying everywhere. The driver has problems to control the Scorpio in the tight corners of the parking garage, due to the tires being blown, so he slightly hits the curb in one scene.
Another henchman fires a rocket from his LAW 80 launcher at Bond, but the rocket goes straight through the damaged windows of the BMW, leaves the car again and destroys the Scorpio instead.
The Scorpio has a (fake) licence plate HH-J5273. HH is the designation for Hansestadt Hamburg in the German plate system.

Now Mallory is the one holding C at gunpoint and plans to bring him down the spiral staircase leading to the bottom of the building to have him incarcerated.

In the ensuing struggle, Denbigh loses his balance and drops over the ledge of the platform, falling to his death several floors below. Tanner confirmed the death of Max Denbigh.

142,/wiki/Diamond_satellite,"The diamond satellite was a fictional orbital laser weapon commissioned by Ernst Stavro Blofeld under the guise of and using the resources of billionaire industrialist, Willard Whyte. It was featured in EON Productions' 1971 James Bond film Diamonds are Forever.
The final product of Blofeld's diamond smuggling pipeline, the diamond satellite was built by light refraction expert Dr. Metz at the Willard Whyte's Techtronics Plant in Nevada, United States. The laser is activated by using several hundred diamonds to concentrate and amplify a laser beam strong enough to destroy ICBM facilities, submarines, and other strategic targets from outer space orbit and is controlled from an oil platform off the coast of Baja California, ostensibly owned by Whyte Enterprises Inc.. While Metz naively believes the weapon to be a means of securing world peace, Blofeld uses the device to extort money from Washington DC. Similar orbital weapons appear in GoldenEye and in Die Another Day. The satellite is also similar to most other laser devices throughout the Bond film series, with this one being the largest and most powerful laser to date.

146,/wiki/Anthony_Dawson,"Anthony Dawson (1916-1992) was a Scottish actor who was famous for playing a James Bond villain, Professor Dent.
Born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1916, Anthony Dawson made a name for himself playing villainous roles in over 70 screen productions. His first on-screen role was as a 27 year old in a James Mason mystery-romance ""They Met in the Dark"". He went on to play in ""They Were Not Divided"", a war adventure directed by Terence Young. The film also starred other soon-to-be James Bond stars, Christopher Lee and Desmond Llewelyn. Dawson would go on to work with Young on several other productions.
Dawson came to Hollywood recognition in the 1953 Hitchcock production ""Dial M for Murder"" which also starred Grace Kelly and Ray Milland. An extract from his unpublished autobiography recalls how Hitch hosted a dinner party where Dawson met his co-star Grace Kelly. ""At the end of the evening I found myself escorting her home. She was staying at the Chateau Marmont, a small, classy apartment house on the strip. It was very warm, there was moonlight, there were stars reflecting on the surface of the pool, there were tall, dark cypress trees with cicadas chirruping. And again, how did it happen? We found ourselves swimming together in the tepid waters. I don't know how some things happen, they just do. They seem so natural that no other course is possible. The next evening we had a date.""
In the 1950s Dawson moved to the US to work, appearing in a string of television bit parts - most notably a leading role in the three-part drama ""I Killed The Count"" - screened as part of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" in 1957.
In the early 1960s he returned from the US to the UK and won a role in James Bond's first on-screen adventure, Dr. No. He played the suspicious Professor Dent. The film was again directed by Terence Young and the following year - despite his character's death - Dawson was welcomed back to the Bond productions to lend his figure (but not his face) to the still-unknown Number One of SPECTRE. He would play the character that would come to be known as Blofeld in both From Russia with Love and Thunderball.
Beyond Bond, Dawson served in four ""Danger Man"" episodes between 1960 and 1965 as well as the James Bond parody, starring Connery's younger brother Neil, O.K. Connery (1967). Dawson teamed up with Terence Young on several other productions, including ""Triple Cross"" (1966), ""Inchon"" (1982) and ""The Jigsaw Man"" (1983).
Outside of Hollywood, during the 1970s and '80s, Dawson worked on a string of Italian film productions, notably ""Rosolino Paternò, soldato..."" (1970) which also starred Hollywood veterans Martin Landau and Peter Falk.
Anthony Dawson worked right up until his death in 1992, his last role was a bit part in ""Selling Hitler"" a five part miniseries about the fraudulent sale of Hitler's diaries.
Dawson ultimately passed away in Sussex, UK, on January 8th 1992; he was 75.

The goons close in on Bond, who is repeatedly buffeted by attendees of the carnival, but are ultimately unsuccessful in recapturing him, as Bond is found by his girlfriend Tracy, who leads Bond to her car before driving away.
Realizing that Bond had escaped them, the thugs returned to their car, the driver having seen which direction Bond drove away in. The spy attempts to use a phone box in the next town over to contact London, only to nearly get killed by Bunt, who fires several rounds at him in a sneak attack. Sitting in the back of the car, Felsen tried to shoot at Tracy's car as it hurtled along the icy roads, but is unable to get a clear shot. The car then skidded off the road and into a pile of deep snow.
Arriving at Lauterbrunnen, Bond and Tracy discover an ongoing stock car race and crash through the barriers to lose their pursuers. As expected, Bunt and her men followed and carnage ensued, with the spectators thinking they were part of the race. Sitting in the front passenger seat of the car, Braun managed to get a few potshots at Tracy's car before his own car is flung upside down, causing it to combust. The vehicle's occupants were forced to abandon the burning car before it exploded. Felsen is last seen trying to help Bunt out of the vehicle before running away with the others.
Felsen final's fate is unknown. He is not among the victims in the final battle in Piz Gloria where most of Blofeld's soldiers lost their lives, but in all likelihood it is possible some of Blofeld's men from Piz Gloria may have been in Lauterbrunnen or the surrounding areas at the time. It's a possibility Felsen is one of these. He may have more likely escaped with Irma Bunt after the Mercedes-Benz W111 blew up at the stock car race where Bunt was slightly caught in the blast. Felsen may have looked after her as she was trying to recover from her injuries.

150,/wiki/Blades,"Blades was a fictional gentlemen's club situated on Park Street off St James's Street, in central London. The location first appeared in the Ian Fleming's 1955 James Bond novel, Moonraker, and was subsequently featured or referenced in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964) and The Man with the Golden Gun (1965). The location also appeared in the comic strip adaptations of Fleming's novels which ran in The Daily Express newspapers.
Blades is situated on “Park Street” (correct name Park Place) off of St James's Street, at the approximate location of the real-life club Pratt's. Blades was founded between 1774 and 1776 and is of a calibre equal to or greater than that of any other club. Blades’s annual closings, its members have to “pig it” at the prestigious White’s or Boodle’s. It excels in terms of member accommodations, staff, food, and furnishings, and its members include some of the finest card players in the world. The club has a limit of 200 members, and there are only two qualifications for being elected a member: behaving like a gentleman and being able to “show” ₤100,000 in cash or gilt-edged securities ant any time. Another Blade's Club rule dictates that every member must win or lose at least £500 a year at cards on the club premises.
M is a member of Blades, and James Bond, though not a member, is an occasional guest of his. M often lunches at Blades, usually eating a spare meal of grilled Dover sole and ""the ripest spoonful he could gouge from the club Stilton."" As a favour to M, Blades also stocks a very bad Algerian red wine, to which he is partial, which he calls ""Infuriator"", but the club refuses to put it on the wine list.
Blades plays a prominent role in the novel Moonraker. M, along with the club chairman Lord Basildon, suspect another member, Sir Hugo Drax, to be cheating at bridge. Because Drax is involved in a nuclear missile project crucial to national security, M and Basildon wish to avoid a scandal. Because of Bond’s skill at cards, M invites him to Blades to discern Drax’s method of cheating. When Bond finds that Drax is using a shiner (i.e., a highly-polished silver cigarette case that allows him to read the cards as he deals), M. and Basildon go along with a plan of Bond’s to teach Drax a lesson and discourage him from further cheating. During a very high-stakes bridge game, Bond switches in a cold deck, making Drax believe he has an extraordinarily good hand that in reality allows Bond to achieve a grand slam, costing Drax ₤15,000.
Years later M has lunch at Blades with Sir James Moloney and talks about Bond's state of mental health after the death of his wife, Tracy. Moloney says that Bond is in shock and needs a wakeup call to return him to liveliness. M says he is going to fire Bond, though Moloney pleads him not to. He suggests Bond get one last chance, but on a seemingly impossible, yet crucial, mission as he needs some motivation and a task big enough to take his mind off Tracy.

Trevor, ever ignorant, arrogant and egotistical is not impress with James's loss to Lilly as she is just a girl calling himself a living weapon, as he makes his way onto the mat, despite just being a yellow belt. He then makes a fool of himself attempting to throw Lilly before she easily sends him down to the mat. Still unimpressed, and ignorant as ever, he considers this a lucky throw.  
Mr Michal claps his hands declaring and end to the practice session. He gets on his knees as does the hole team, they bow to each other. Michal says he thinks they are in  good shape for the judo tournament especially with Lilly he congratulates her on making the team. Lilly says she is honored but cant go to Japan with the team.

Mr Michel leaves James to it. James, who is clearly out of practice in judo askes for help with his shoulder throw. Lilly steps over to him, takes hold of his hand and arm and tells him he needs better leverage and to spread his feet more. He does so only to be thrown by Lilly, using a shoulder throw. James then gives a try, heeding Lilly's earlier given warning about keeping his guard up and spreading his feet. Lilly still is easily about to throw him, this time with submission or  throw, but it appears that James is beginning to understand judo and just needs practices James askes Lilly who taught her judo. She says her father who she has not seen in 2 years. James invites Lilly for a soda which she accepts.

IQ enplanes that the new function he has built into James watch is an electronic jamming device. James then heads off to meat Lilly.

After going out for a soda with Lilly the two walk back to Warfield together. James finally gets Lilly to open up about why she wont go to Japan with the judo team. Lilly says its because she's afraid of making friends as she will have to say goodbye, as she has moved to several different schools in the last two years. Lilly, therefor, prefers no to make friends as it is easier that way. James disagrees, stating that friends are important, especially when you need them. Just then, the same masked men storm the park they are walking through. James is easy able to disarmed one of the masked men and throws another using the same move Lilly use on him early. Lilly comments that he is fighting well, as she defeats another of the masked men. James comments, I had a good teacher.

156,/wiki/Comic_strips,"The Daily Express is a tabloid newspaper that began publication in 1900, with a Sunday edition under the name ""The Sunday Express"" was launched in 1918. In 1958, the paper began to run a comic strip based based on the James Bond property, written by Anthony Hern, Henry Gammidge, Peter O'Donnell and Jim Lawrence over the run of the series. The series was illustrated by John McLusky and Yaroslav Horak. Starting in 1958 and continuing to 1983, 007 appeared in 52 comic strips that were syndicated in British newspapers, 7 of which were published abroad.
In 1957 the Daily Express, a newspaper owned by Lord Beaverbrook, approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips. Ian Fleming at the time was reluctant to allow this because he felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing and could potentially hurt his series while he was still authoring them. Ian Fleming wrote:
Regardless, Fleming later agreed and the first strip Casino Royale was published in 1958. The story was adapted by Anthony Hern who had previously serialized Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia with Love for the Daily Express. The illustrations of the strip were done by John McLusky who would later go on to illustrate 12 more James Bond comic strips with partner Henry Gammidge until 1966.
To aid the Daily Express in illustrating James Bond, Ian Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of what he believed James Bond to look like. John McLusky, however, felt that Fleming's 007 looked too ""outdated"" and ""pre-war"" and thus changed Bond to give him a more masculine look.
The majority of the early strips were adapted by Henry Gammidge, however the adaptation of Dr. No was handled by Peter O'Donnell, a couple of years before he launched his legendary strip, Modesty Blaise.
In 1962 the Daily Express abruptly cancelled their agreement with Ian Fleming when a dispute between Lord Beaverbrook and Fleming erupted over the rights to the short story The Living Daylights. Fleming had sold the rights to the Sunday Times, a rival newspaper which upset Beaverbrook to the point of terminating his relationship with Fleming. The dispute caused the comic strip adaptation of Thunderball to come to an abrupt end. Thunderball was actually never finished; however, a few additional panels were later added for syndication in other newspapers to expand and conclude the story. Lord Beaverbrook and Ian Fleming would later work out their differences and the comic strip serial would continue in 1964 with On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
In 1966 Yaroslav Horak replaced John McLusky as the artist for the Daily Express comic strip series and adapted six more Ian Fleming James Bond novels and short stories as well as Kingsley Amis' Colonel Sun with partner Jim Lawrence. The Living Daylights was also republished in the Daily Express after first appearing in the first edition of the Sunday Times magazine on February 4, 1962 and in the American magazine Argosy in June of the same year under the title ""Berlin Escape.""
In 1977 the Daily Express discontinued their series of Bond comic strips, although Horak and Lawrence went on to write and illustrate several other James Bond adventures for syndication abroad in Europe, for the Sunday Express (the Sunday edition of the Daily Express), and the Daily Star. Additionally, John McLusky returned to team up with Jim Lawrence for five comic strips.
The 1983 strip Polestar was abruptly terminated by the Daily Star midway through its run and was not completed, although the complete story did appear in non-UK newspapers and was followed by several more complete serials before the James Bond comic strip officially came to an end.
Since first publication in the Daily Express, the comic strip adaptations have been reprinted several times. First by the James Bond 007 International Fan Club, in the early 1980s. Then annually, from 1987 to 1990, by the British Titan Books company in anthologies, beginning with The Living Daylights to tie-in with the release of the eponymous James Bond film.
Beginning in 2004, Titan reissued these anthologies in larger, revised editions, and also began reprinting stories that hadn't been featured in the earlier books. With a more frequent publishing schedule than the first series, to date seven books have been released with more scheduled. These volumes include new introductory chapters on the history of the strip and the Bond novels, and most of the books have also included special introductions written by Bond film actors, specifically Caroline Munro (The Spy Who Loved Me), George Lazenby (OHMSS), Shirley Eaton (Goldfinger), Eunice Gayson (Dr. No), Roger Moore (Casino Royale), Maud Adams (Octopussy) and Britt Ekland (Colonel Sun). Titan's comic strip reprints were not initially published in the strips' original publication order; this changed as of the release of the The Spy Who Loved Me volume.
The Harpies, included in The Spy Who Loved Me, is the first non-Fleming-based Bond comic strip to be reprinted as well as the first original story. River of Death, in the Colonel Sun collection, is the second original story to be published (Colonel Sun itself being an adaptation of the first post-Fleming Bond novel). The Golden Ghost, announced for an April 2006 release, is the first collection comprising all-original stories. By 2011 they had released each of the Daily Express strips in paperback form, and in 2015 they began to publish the strips based upon Fleming's work in large hardcover editions.

Born during the 1980s in Bristol, England, Dharma Reach and her family subsequently moved to Vermont and several other locations around the United States. At some point she joined the U.S. Marine Corps and was eventually given command of an unspecified military prison, which she used as ""her own private torture garden"". In order to forestall an investigation into her misconduct, Reach plotted to kill her superiors with an IED; during the construction of which she lost both her forearms. She left the military and, after being augmented with cutting-edge prosthetic limbs, was recruited as a private security agent by Serbian scientist, Slaven Kurjak. During her time working for him in Germany, Reach met fellow-enforcer and chronic anhedonia sufferer Bryan Masters, and entered a romantic relationship with him.
During the mid-2010s, Kurjak began experimenting on the British population — smuggling tainted illegal drugs into the United Kingdom. Unaware of their precise origin, MI6 sent James Bond to shut down the operation. Aware of his impending arrival through CIA contacts, Kurjak dispatched Reach to intercept the spy on his arrival in Berlin and, posing as a friendly contact, eliminate him. During their car journey through the city, Reach seduced and strangled Bond; but was ultimately foiled when the agent delivered a kick to her driver, causing the car to swerve and crash. Believing 007 to be armed she fled the scene and returned to Kurjak Medizin. Later that day, attempting to get Bond killed, Kurjak led him to investigate a warehouse operated by the aggressive Al-Zein gang. Reach was ordered to shadow him and report on the situation. Much to her amazement, he emerged unscathed.
In a desperate attempt to rid themselves of MI6, Masters, accompanied by Reach, was sent to assassinate Bond and the staff of the Berlin intelligence station. Whilst they were unable to locate Bond, the Station massacre provided the dysfunctional Masters with fleeting amorous feelings; which ultimately went nowhere, much to both parties' despair. The following evening, having discovered that Bond had killed Masters in her absence, Dharma attacked him in the London Docklands; ramming his Bentley with a Land Rover and violently struggling with him. During the altercation, Bond managed to rip open her bionic limbs and rupture their volatile batteries. After Reach gloatingly turned her back on the bloodied agent, he seized the opportunity to kick her over the edge of the dock, where her prosthetics exploded and killed her.

The bulldog ornament is a Union Jack-emblazoned bone china figurine which takes pride of place on M's desk in the 2012 James Bond film, Skyfall. It would make brief subsequent appearances in Spectre (2015) and No Time to Die (2021). The bulldog is an original Royal Doulton figurine produced in 1941.
The porcelain bulldog was one of the few personal items that M kept on her desk in the SIS Building and was the only thing to survive Raoul Silva's terrorist attack on the building; much to Bond's evident disappointment. After the SIS Chief's untimely death, Eve Moneypenny revealed that she had left the ornament to him. Eve interpreted it as M's way of telling Bond to get a desk job. He thought the opposite. Bond would later keep the item on a coffee table in his flat and finally put the item into storage alongside his Aston Martin V8.
Apparently a popular item among British intelligence chiefs, the same Royal Doulton ornament also appeared in the 2011 film adaptation of John Le Carre's spy novel Tinker,Tailor, Soldier, Spy in the office of ""Control"", the head of the British Intelligence Service.

At the end of the vacation season, the Phanceys entrust Viv to look after the motel for the night before the owner, Mr. Sanguinetti, can arrive to take inventory and close it up for the winter. Two mobsters, ""Sluggsy"" Morant and Sol ""Horror"" Horowitz, both of whom work for Sanguinetti, arrive and say they are there to look over the motel for insurance purposes.
In reality, the two have been hired by Sanguinetti to burn down the motel so that Sanguinetti can make a profit on the insurance. The blame for the fire would fall on Viv, who was to perish in the incident. The mobsters, are cruel to Viv and, when she says she does not want to dance with them, they attack her, holding her down and starting to remove her top. They are about to continue the attack with rape when the door buzzer stops them.
British secret service agent James Bond appears at the door asking for a room, having had a flat tyre while passing. Bond quickly realises that Horror and Sluggsy are mobsters and that Viv is in danger. Pressuring the two men, he eventually gets the gangsters to agree to provide him a room. That night Sluggsy and Horror set fire to the motel and attempt to kill Bond and Michel. A gun battle ensues and, in the process of escaping, Horror and Sluggsy's car crashes into a lake. Bond and Michel retire to bed, but Sluggsy is still alive and makes a further attempt to kill them when Bond shoots him.
In 1977 the title ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" was used for the tenth film in the Eon Productions series. It was the third to star Roger Moore as British Secret Service agent Commander James Bond. Although Fleming had requested no elements from his original book be used, the novel features two thugs named Sol Horror and Sluggsy Morent. Horror is described as having steel-capped teeth, while Sluggsy had a clear bald head. These characters would be the basis for the characters of Jaws and Sandor.
According to Black, the two thugs, Sluggsy and Horror, are ""comic-book villains with comic-book names"". Their characters are not given the same status as other villains in Bond stories, but are second-rate professional killers, which makes them more believable in the story.

196,/wiki/Die_Another_Day_(film),"Die Another Day is the twentieth James Bond series made by EON Productions and the fourth and final film to star Pierce Brosnan as MI6 agent James Bond. It was released in 2002 and produced by Bond veterans Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. It is the first film not to feature Desmond Llewelyn as Q since Live and Let Die (1973) after his death from a car accident in 1999, days after The World Is Not Enough was released.
The story begins in the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea with a spectacular high-speed hovercraft chase and continues via Hong Kong to Cuba and London where Bond meets up with the two ladies who are to play such important and differing roles in his quest to unmask a traitor and to prevent a war of catastrophic consequence. Hot on the trail of the principal villains, Bond travels to Iceland where he experiences at first hand the power of an amazing new weapon before a dramatic confrontation with his main adversary back in Korea where it all started.
Although not officially acknowledged as a second adaptation of Fleming's novel, Moonraker, Die Another Day includes plot elements from the book that go beyond the fact the movie contains references to numerous past films and books. In the novel, a Nazi adopts a new identity, Hugo Drax, and becomes a popular British multi-millionaire. He then donates millions to create a ""Moonraker"" missile which is supposed to be for Britain's protection but is actually meant to destroy London. The parallels between that plot and Die Another Day's plot are apparent. In addition, the club called Blades, a fencing club in this film, was featured as a card club in Moonraker and Bond and the villain have different forms of ""duels"" in those locations. Lastly, the character of Miranda Frost was originally named Gala Brand, the same name as the Bond girl in the original Moonraker novel. This makes Die Another Day the first Bond film since 1989's Licence to Kill to adapt substantial elements from Fleming's stories.
Die Another Day is the first Bond film to acknowledge borrowing a major element from a non-Fleming novel; according to the DVD release, the Korean villain, Colonel Tan-Sun Moon, is named in honour of Colonel Sun, the villain in Kingsley Amis's Bond novel of the same name.
The film is also the last of the ""original timeline"" of the franchise, before the series was rebooted in 2006 with Casino Royale, starring Daniel Craig as Bond. Judi Dench would be the only actor in the ""original"" series to continue playing the same character in the reboot.
The plot, reminiscent of Moonraker, Diamonds Are Forever and GoldenEye, involves billionaire businessman ""Gustav Graves"", who through Cuban genetic engineering, is actually a North Korean Colonel (Colonel Moon) who in the pre-title sequence was supposedly killed by Bond. The film's title, Die Another Day, refers to Colonel Moon surviving his first encounter with 007. Upon meeting later in the film Bond comments, ""So you live to die another day.""
Moon's scheme involves the construction of an orbital mirror system made of diamonds that will supposedly focus solar energy on a small area to light the Arctic nights. In truth the orbital mirror system is actually a superweapon designed to clear a path through the minefield in the demilitarized zone that separates North Korea from South Korea.
Bond, with the aid of NSA agent Giacinta ""Jinx"" Johnson, defeats Colonel Moon, whose other major technology is an exoskeleton equipped with a high-voltage electric weapon, and prevents global catastrophe. Along the way, he beds both Jinx and Moon' assistant, the blond ""ice queen"" Miranda Frost. Frost, in a succession of twists, is first revealed to be working for MI6, then later as a double agent for Moon.
Unbeknownst to Moon, Bond had not only survived their Arctic encounter, but had covertly boarded the plane in North Korea. On board, after Moon murders his father General Moon, Bond attempts to shoot Graves but is foiled by a henchman and opens a window instead; causing the plane to depressurize. Donning the mechanical exoskeleton, Moon and Bond fight hand-to-hand as the aircraft spirals out of control. After seemingly defeating Bond by electrocution, Moon attempts to evacuate the plummeting aircraft by parachute. Bond reaches out and yanks the parachute's release cord; causing Moon to be pulled through a hole in the fuselage. As Moon desperately clings onto the edge of the chassis, Bond reaches out and activates the suit's electric defenses causing Moon to shock himself. He loses his grip and is sucked - along with the controls for the Icarus - into the plane's jet engine.
The movie departs from the usual Bond formula in several ways. Die Another Day begins with an action set-piece which, instead of a comic ending, ends with Bond captured by the North Korean army, after which he is tortured for fourteen months, depicted in a stylized manner through the title sequence. The movie also shows some attempts to improve the appeal of Bond to a younger audience, featuring two separate scenes of Bond surfing, a more contemporary soundtrack (by David Arnold), and extensive use of The Matrix-style slow-motion pans. Critical reaction to the film was mixed, even allowing for the typical disdain of action films (and of sequels) held by many reviewers. Many saw it as a retread of old ideas from the Roger Moore era that did not mesh with more ""modern"" takes on the genre such as 24 and The Bourne Identity, and scoffed at the attempts to appeal to a younger audience; supporters of the film counter that the so-called ""retread of old ideas"" was simply the film paying homage to earlier Bond films, adding that Bond's incarceration and torture at the start of the movie sufficiently broke the pattern of recent Bond films.
Some also felt that the extensive use of CGI special effects detracted from one of the major appeals of the older films—that the stunts, however preposterous, were actually performed. The quality of the CGI effects in some scenes was also criticized; compare the action sequence at the beginning (Bond's near-escape in Northern Korea using hovercrafts) and the parachute-assisted surfing stunt at the end.
The Film is also criticized for its unrealistic approach too, with its plot which was largely considered ""far fetched"" An idea aided by elements such as the Genetics Clinics, The Ice Palace, and the invisibility cloak on the Aston Martin V12 Vanquish fitted by Q Branch.
Marketing for the film was also criticized by some fans. In previous Bond films (with the exception of On Her Majesty's Secret Service) the actor to portray Bond is undoubtedly the top-billed star with all other actors in a supporting role; however with Die Another Day Bond girl Halle Berry had been elevated to co-star status with Pierce Brosnan; at least one of the film's posters gives Berry equal billing with Brosnan.
The film also elicited poor opinions across the Korean peninsula, with the North unhappy with its portrayal as a brutal, war-hungry state, whilst many South Koreans were offended by a romantic scene conducted in a Buddhist temple and a scene where an American officer issues orders to the South Korean army in the defense of their own homeland.
Regardless of these criticisms, Die Another Day took in $456 million in ticket sales worldwide, making it the highest-grossing Bond film until Casino Royale was released in 2006.
Die Another Day was the first movie since Live and Let Die not to feature Desmond Llewelyn, who had died in 1999 just after the release of The World Is Not Enough. John Cleese, formerly of Monty Python's Flying Circus and Fawlty Towers took over the role of Q; however, it is clear that he is playing a different character (who had been introduced as Q's assistant in The World Is Not Enough). Cleese's Q refers to ""his predecessor"" in one scene.
See: Die Another Day (soundtrack)
See Die Another Day (novelisation)
Berry's performance was heavily criticized by many reviewers and fans, though ironically she won an Academy Award for Best Actress (for Monster's Ball) in the midst of filming, making her only the second actor after Christopher Walken to be an Oscar-winner at the time of their appearance in an official Bond film (Judi Dench also won an Oscar in 1999, but this was after her debut in the series). Regardless of these criticisms, the character of Jinx was nonetheless considered popular enough for MGM to announce plans for the first-ever James Bond spin-off movie based upon the character and starring Halle Berry. Stephen Frears was attached to direct. MGM abruptly cancelled production in late 2003 to focus on the next James Bond film, Casino Royale. Some film critics have speculated that the cancellation may have been connected to the box office underperformance of several female-led action films in 2003, most notably Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life. However, according in some interviews Berry has not ruled out a possibility of Jinx spin-off.
Being released on the 40th anniversary of the James Bond franchise, there were many references to the past 19 James Bond movies in Die Another Day.

199,/wiki/GoldenEye_speedrunning,"The 1997 video game GoldenEye 007 is one of the most infamous games for its speedrunning community. Since the summer of 1997 there have been competitions to speedrun the game.
Speed strafing involves rapidly moving left and right to gain speed. This can help in navigating maps faster. This allows for a 40% time save over those not using the strat.
This involves manually centering the analogue stick on the Nintendo 64 joypad by pressing L+R+START simultaneously while the stick is held down. When the stick is released, the N64 registers that the stick is being held forwards, causing the player to move automatically. This prevents the player from moving backwards, as pushing the stick down will only stop the player. Runner Wes McKinney called Wouter Jansen a cheater for using the strat, however, the strat is allowed in speedrunning.
This is one of the most controversial strats in all of speedrunning, and many say that it almost killed GoldenEye speedrunning. It involves looking down through the entire mission to make the N64 render as little as possible (since only things visible to the player are rendered in GoldenEye). Due to the reduced amount of rendering, this can make the game run faster. It saves 1 75th of a second. It was first used by the runner Supernova, who also came up with the idea of sticking tape to a runner's TV to act as a crosshair, as GoldenEye does not have one. This strat is named the Illinois Cross of Death. This would later evolve into Dot Strat, which remains in use to this day.

Brought up in Ringwood, England, Elizabeth was a model turned hotel receptionist until she met and married rich entrepreneur Milton Krest. She met James Bond while he was on assignment in the Seychelles following her husband, in the search for the rare fish, ""The Hildebrand Rarity"". Elizabeth is subject to much verbal and physical abuse by Milton, who punishes her with the use of a stingray tail he dubs ""The Corrector"". Krest finds the Hildebrand Rarity and kills it—along with many other fish—by pouring poison into the water.
Bond finds Krest murdered, who had the fish stuffed down his throat. So as not to instigate a murder investigation, Bond throws Krest overboard and cleans up the crime scene, making it appear that Krest fell overboard after one of his hammock ropes broke. Bond suspects Elizabeth, but is unsure if she is responsible.
Afterwards, Elizabeth invites Bond to stay on her boat as a guest and sail with her to Mombasa, India, his next destination, he accepts her invitation. Bond was still unsure if it was her who killed her husband, and he never asks, probably thinking she deserved revenge on Milton for her years of ill treatment.

203,/wiki/Beretta_418,"The Beretta 418 was an Italian handgun and was, effectively, James Bond's first firearm. Although it was Bond's weapon of choice in the early Fleming novels, it was replaced in Dr. No by the Walther PPK. The reason for this change is found in the previous book, From Russia, With Love where the silencer of Bond's Beretta gets caught in the waistband of his trousers which prevented him from drawing his gun. Taking several months to recover from injuries sustained at the end of the earlier book, Bond has his new weapon forced upon him. In Dr. No (1962), Bond begins with a Beretta M1934, however, just as in the novel, it is promptly replaced by the PPK for similar reasons.
When Ian Fleming wrote the first of the James Bond novels, Casino Royale, he had no idea the direction in which the stories would go, let alone how many he would eventually write. So when he introduced Bond as using a Beretta 418 in a flat chamois leather holster he probably didn't think too much about it. He had used such a gun during the Second World War when he was in Naval Intelligence and felt it was an appropriate sidearm for a secret agent on an undercover mission.
Shortly before the publication of From Russia with Love in 1956, Fleming received a fan letter from a Major Geoffrey Boothroyd. Boothroyd was a retired Army Major and gun collector. Boothroyd told Fleming that he really admired the Bond novels apart from the hero's choice of weapon. He felt that the Beretta 418 was ""a lady's gun"" with no real stopping power. He also objected to the choice of holster. Boothroyd proposed that Bond should use a revolver like the Smith & Wesson Centennial Airweight. It had no external hammer, so it would not catch on Bond's clothes. The Smith & Wesson could be kept in a Berns-Martin triple draw holster held in place with a spring clip which would increase Bond's draw time. Boothroyd also had bad words about the silencer Bond occasionally used, saying that they were rarely silent and reduced the power of a gun.
Fleming replied, thanked the Major for his letter, and made a few points. He felt that Bond ought to have an automatic pistol; perhaps Boothroyd could recommend one? He agreed that the Beretta 418 lacked power, but pointed out that Bond had used more powerful weapons when the need required, such as the Colt Army Special he uses in Moonraker. Fleming also said that he had seen a silenced Sten gun during the war and the weapon had hardly made a whisper.
Boothroyd recommended the Walther PPK 7.65mm as being the best choice for an automatic of that size, with its ammunition available everywhere. He suggested, however, that 007 ought to have a revolver for long-range work. Fleming asked Boothroyd is he could lend his illustrator Richard Chopping one of his guns to be painted for the cover of From Russia with Love. Boothroyd lent Chopping a .357 Magnum revolver that had the trigger guard removed for faster firing.
Fleming had the silencer of Bond's Beretta get caught in waistband of this trousers at the end of From Russia with Love, an event that almost costs the secret agent his life. In the next novel, Dr. No, a certain Major Boothroyd recommends that Bond switch guns. Bond argued unsuccessfully that because of the silencer the incident would have happened with any kind of gun. Boothroyd also recommends that Bond should stay away from silencers. Bond is issued a Walther PPK but is told to carry it in a Berns-Martin triple draw holster, which is designed only to carry revolvers. This is an odd mistake given that Fleming had bought such a holster and had it sent to Jamaica. (It has been argued that Q-branch could have modified an excellent holster to accommodate automatics.)
In a moment of mild humor, as Bond leaves M's office with his new sidearm, he tries to take his old Beretta by hiding it under the PPK's wooden box. M isn't fooled, and again orders Bond to leave the old pistol behind.

After meeting Janus operative Xenia Onatopp in a Monte Carlo casino, Admiral Farrel is lured back to her yacht, the Manticore, for a night of fun. In the next scene the two are having sex. Xenia snogs him passionately and then Onatopp wraps her legs around his chest and proceeds to crush him to death between her thighs. Farrell's last words are ""Xenia, I can't breathe!"" shortly before he dies from lack of oxygen. The following morning, as Onatopp and her accomplice use the man's ID card to steal a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter, James Bond is trying to get information about Onatopp by snooping on the yacht. Bond is momentarily taken aback when he sees a naked man on the yacht who then falls forward. Bond then realizes that is the corpse of Admiral Farrel with rigor mortis having taken place in his body and he still retains a grin from the revelry of the previous night's promiscuity.

208,/wiki/Age_of_Heroes,"Age of Heroes is a war film directed by Adrian Vitoria. The film is based on the real-life events of the formation of Ian Fleming's 30 Commando unit during World War II. The film was released in the United Kingdom in 2011.
Age of Heroes follows the exploits of Corporal Rains (Danny Dyer) as he is inducted into the newly formed 30 Commando unit in World War II after freed from a war prison for disrupting orders during operations of France. Rains and the rest of the platoon are put through intensive training under the watchful eye of Major Jones (Sean Bean), where their skills and endurance are pushed to the limit as they prepare for their first highly classified and dangerous mission: to parachute into occupied Norway and capture new radar technology from the Germans which could change the outcome of the war.

After a long trek in the snow the commandos try to resupply by returning to a previously visited farm. Its inhabitants had been shot by German units after they refused to collaborate with them. To make things worse, the Germans catch up with them at the farm, bringing with them a commando captured alive during an earlier fire fight. The Germans ask for the commandos' surrender in exchange for the life of their captured friend. The commandos refuse to surrender. They open fire on the Germans, beginning an intense fire fight. Jensen and radar specialist Rollright are ordered to run for the Swedish border while the rest of the commandos provide cover for them.
Eventually Major Jones realizes that there are too many German soldiers and that the commandos have insufficient ammunition. He orders Rains and Steinar to run for the border while two others stay to cover them. Those who remain at the farm are last seen firing on and suppressing the Germans. The Germans catch up to Rains and Steinar retreating; Steinar is shot and killed. Out of ammunition, Rains prepares to use his knife to kill himself so the Germans cannot torture him. Before he does so, Jensen and Rollright return and enable the three of them to escape.
The last scene shows the two surviving team members and Jensen standing on a hill looking down into Sweden.

209,/wiki/Dr._Dave_Greenwalt,"Dr. Dave Greenwalt is a fictional United States Air Force Global Positioning System (GPS) expert. A supporting character in the 1997 film Tomorrow Never Dies, he is portrayed by Canadian actor Colin Stinton.
Upon examining the device, Greenwalt explains that Carver's associate had tampered with the timing chip, sending the British ship HMS Devonshire off-course and into Chinese territorial waters, where the ship was sunk and a Chinese MiG jet shot down by Carver's ship to incite tensions between the two countries. As a result of the doctor's expertise, he was able to confirm where the Devonshire actually was based on data from the encoder.
Greenwalt later accompanied Wade and Bond aboard an American transport craft, which the latter H.A.L.O. jumped from while above Vietnamese territorial waters. The doctor confirmed to Wade and another officer that Bond's equipment was stamped with American insignia, much to the consternation of the two.

210,/wiki/GoldenEye_007_(1997_game),"The topic of this page has a wiki of its own:  GoldenEye Wiki.
GoldenEye 007 is a 1997 first-person shooter video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The game is based on the 1995 film GoldenEye.
The game has received overwhelmingly positive reviews and often listed as one of the best games for the Nintendo 64 and sold over eight million copies. It is considered an important title in the development of first person shooters, and has become particularly well-known for the quality of its multiplayer deathmatch mode, as well as its incorporation of stealth and varied objectives into its single-player missions.
GoldenEye 007 was originally announced for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System before being stepped up to the Nintendo 64. The intention for the first few months of development was for the game to be an on-rails shooter; it only became a first-person shooter later in development. The development team working on GoldenEye 007 was inexperienced; for all but two of them, the project was their first game.
The game is based upon the GoldenEye film and its novelization by John Gardner, but, as game designer Martin Hollis explained, many of the missions were extended or modified to allow the player to participate in sequences of which Bond was not originally a part, or those in which he only played a minor role. The original sets that were created for the film were first converted into complete, believable environments by one group of game designers; when this process was complete, other designers began populating them with objectives, characters and obstacles in order to create a balanced and fun game. According to Martin Hollis, ""many of the levels in the game have a realistic and non-linear feel. There are rooms with no direct relevance to the level. There are multiple routes across the level."" Hollis also noted that the concept of several varied objectives within each level was inspired by the multiple tasks in each stage of Super Mario 64.
GoldenEye was developed through two and a half years, but, according to Martin Hollis, only the last year was spent developing the game. During the beginning, the engine was built, art assets were made, and the enemy AI was written and polished. The game was delayed numerous times, partly because during development, the team decided to incorporate a multiplayer feature to the game to demonstrate the N64's 4-player capabilities. In addition to the N64 game, a version of GoldenEye was in development for the Nintendo Virtual Boy, but was canceled before release.
GoldenEye 007's menu system is presented as an MI6 dossier. Four save files are available to track the player's progress through the game's twenty missions, each of which may be played on either ""Agent,"" ""Secret Agent,"" or ""00-Agent,"" difficulty settings, with higher difficulties requiring the player to complete additional and more complex objectives. M, Q, and Miss Moneypenny provide background information on the chosen mission and its goals.
Once a mission is completed, the player may either continue progressing through the story or choose to replay a previously completed level. Completing certain missions within particular target times enables the player to unlock bonus cheat options which make various changes to the graphics and gameplay, and upon fully completing the game on the 00-Agent difficulty level, an additional ""007"" setting allows the player to customize the challenge of any mission.
The player's initial weapon in most missions is James Bond's Walther PPK. Most of the game's firearms are modeled on real-life counterparts, while others are based on fictitious devices featured in the Bond films, such as the Golden Gun and Moonraker laser. The weapons vary in characteristics such as rate of fire and type of ammunition used, and inflict different levels of damage depending on which body part they hit. Stealth is an important element of the game: in order to avoid gunfights with multiple opponents, it is advantageous to eliminate soldiers and security cameras before they spot or hear the player. Certain weapons may be powerful enough to shoot through doors and helmets but are very loud, while others incorporate suppressor or zoom lens attachments to aid the player in killing enemies discreetly.
Some gadgets from the James Bond film series are featured in the game and are often used to complete particular mission objectives; for example, 007's in-game watch includes the laser from the GoldenEye film, the remote mine detonator from GoldenEye and Moonraker, and the electromagnet from Live and Let Die.
The multiplayer mode was added late in the development process; Martin Hollis noted that the setting was ""a complete afterthought"". According to David Doak, the majority of the work on the multiplayer mode was done by Steve Ellis, who ""sat in a room with all the code written for a single-player game and turned GoldenEye into a multiplayer game.""
The multiplayer mode features all of the characters in the game, including enemies and civilians. At first, only 8 characters are available, with 25 more becoming available as progress is made through the game. A button code allows players to temporarily unlock another 31 characters, all but two of them likenesses of the programmers. Variations between characters' heights and builds can affect the challenge of shooting them; for example, there is a significant difference between defeating Oddjob, who is oddly short in stature, and Jaws, a giant.
As with the selectable characters, only a few arenas are available at first, with more becoming available as progress is made in the game. There are eleven arenas, not counting levels that can only be accessed with a GameShark, and a ""random"" button that chooses the level randomly. The multiplayer-only arenas are: Temple, Complex, Caves, Library, Basement, and Stack. Several arenas are taken from the single player mode, with alterations such as restrictions on which sections of the map can be used - they are the Facility, Bunker, Archives, Caverns, and Egyptian.
The multiplayer mode features five general scenarios, within which options such as weapon schemes may be altered. Weapon selections in the multiplayer mode are grouped by type, such as pistols, automatics, and explosives. Other selectable weapon schemes focus on weapons not frequently found in the single player mode, such as laser guns, throwing knives, or the one-hit kill Golden Gun. The ""Slappers Only!"" setting removes all projectiles, limiting players to hand-to-hand combat.
Several references to James Bond films exist in GoldenEye 007, the most apparent being the titles of the various multiplayer modes and the Bond Girl names for the game's control schemes. The CCTV tape found in the second Bunker mission features the cover of the VHS release of the GoldenEye film.
Several members of the game's development staff were featured in the game as generic character faces. Bond's double-agent contact ""Dr. Doak"" in the ""Facility"" mission is named after and bears the likeness of David Doak. The ""Klobb"" weapon (originally ""Spyder""), is named after former Nintendo employee Ken Lobb.
Like the movie, GoldenEye 007 starts in Arkhangelsk, USSR during the mid-1980s, where MI6 has uncovered a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond is sent to infiltrate the facility by bungee jumping from the dam, then join his friend and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan in destroying the factory. During the mission, Trevelyan is apparently killed by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond escapes by commandeering an airplane.
The following missions depict 007's investigation of the satellite control station in Severnaya, Russia where Natalya Simonova and Boris Grishenko work, a location he did not visit in the film. Entirely new to the game is the ""Silo"" mission in which Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in Kyrgyzstan, believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as GoldenEye. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated electromagnetic pulse at any Earth target to disable any electrical circuit within range; from its orbit, it would be a threat to any city on earth.
Bond's visit to Monte Carlo and investigation of the frigate La Fayette and the Eurocopter Tiger (referred to as the ""Pirate"" in the game) were featured in the film, but here they are expanded, with Bond rescuing several hostages inside the ship and planting a tracker bug on the helicopter before it is stolen by the Janus crime syndicate. Bond is then sent a second time to Severnaya, but during the mission he is captured and locked up in the bunker's cells along with Natalya Simonova–this meeting takes place much earlier than in the film. The two escape the complex seconds before it is destroyed, on the orders of Ourumov, by the GoldenEye satellite's EMP.
As in the film, Bond next travels to Saint Petersburg, where he arranges with ex-KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky to meet the chief of the Janus organisation. This is revealed to be Alec Trevelyan–his execution by Ourumov in the Arkhangelsk facility was faked. Bond and Natalya escape from Trevelyan, but are arrested by the Russian police and taken to the military archives for interrogation. The player must escape the interrogation room, rescue Natalya and communicate with Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin, who has verified Bond's claim of Ourumov's treachery.
Natalya is captured by General Ourumov, and Bond gives chase (he can use a tank like in the movie, though he has the option not to) through the streets of Saint Petersburg, eventually reaching an arms depot used by Janus — the player must destroy its weaponry stores, then hitch a ride on Trevelyan's Soviet missile train. This section features many departures from the film storyline, where Bond does not reach the depot, and only enters the train after stopping it with the tank. Bond makes his way through the train, killing Ouromov and rescuing Natalya. However, Alec Trevelyan and his ally Xenia Onatopp escape to their secret base in Cuba.
Natalya accompanies Bond to Cuba. Surveying the jungle aerially, their light aircraft is shot down. Unscathed, Bond and Natalya perform a ground search of the area's heavily guarded jungle terrain, but are ambushed by Xenia, who is quickly killed by Bond. Bond sneaks Natalya into the control center to disrupt transmissions to the GoldenEye satellite and force it to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. An original mission shows Bond following the fleeing Trevelyan through a series of flooded caverns, which conceal a Satellite Dish under water. He then arrives at the antenna of the control centre's radio telescope. Trevelyan attempts to re-align it in a final attempt to restore contact with the GoldenEye. Bond destroys machinery vital to controlling the dish and kills Trevelyan in a precarious firefight high above the dish.
Two further missions unrelated to the GoldenEye film were included as bonuses for the completion of the game on higher difficulties. The first, ""Aztec Complex"", is partially based on the James Bond film Moonraker, and is unlocked when the player completes all 18 missions on Secret Agent difficulty. During the mission, Bond is sent to the Aztec complex in Teotihuacán to investigate the Drax Corporation's unlicensed space exploration in which at least one space shuttle was stolen from NASA. Although Hugo Drax was killed by Bond in the movie, it has seemed that his corporation still existed after his death due to remnants and fragments that were still active. MI6 believes their intentions with the shuttle in space are militant in nature and authorizes Bond to reprogram the shuttle's guidance computer so that MI6 can take control of the craft once it reaches orbit. During the mission, Jaws makes a return in an effort to stop Bond from completing his mission. Many of the rooms in the mission were from the movie and included several new features, such as the launch room for the Moonraker shuttle.
The second bonus level, ""Egyptian Temple"", blends elements from the films The Man with the Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, and Live and Let Die. To access this level players must complete all 18 missions on 00 Agent difficulty. Prior to the mission, M informs Bond that a person claiming to be Baron Samedi is in possession of the deceased Francisco Scaramanga's legendary ""Golden Gun"" pistol. Samedi has invited James Bond to the El-Saghira temple in the Valley of the Kings to retrieve it. Knowing it is a trap, M sends Bond regardless to take possession of the Golden Gun and eliminate Baron Samedi. Although the player ""kills"" Samedi three times during the level, he can be seen laughing in an end-of-level cut scene, similar to the ending of Live and Let Die.
GameShark users found several text references to a level called ""Citadel"" in the game. Rare explained its nature, and joked about players' speculation that multiplayer-mode Bond characters could be seen in the single-player game: ""'Citadel' was a very rough test level designed during the early stages of multiplayer mode. It is not in the finished game in any shape or form, and Oddjob and Mayday would not be in it if it was."" It was thought that a few textual references were all that remained of the level. In 2004, GoldenEye 007 fan sites uncovered an unplayable but viewable single-player version of the level (with implemented sky and water textures).
In 2005, the website GoldenEye Forever revealed that it was possible to access a fully playable multiplayer version by linking a GameShark to a computer. The codes to access Citadel in its fullest state totaled nearly 10,000 lines. The test map is largely a mass of shapes and ramps that the players can climb upon, thus giving players many opportunities for sniping and for hiding.
Before GoldenEye 007 was released, Rare had placed a feature in the multiplayer mode of the game, known as the ""All Bonds"" option. This would allow players to choose four of the five actors (at the time of the game) who had portrayed Bond in various films: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan. George Lazenby was not included. However, before the game was released, Rare removed the feature for unexplained reasons. It is assumed that Rare had every intention to release the game with the feature, but was later forced to remove it. In response, Rare said ""Yes, it was the hope of the team that [all Bonds] would be available to play, but for various reasons they weren't.""
In addition, the actors' portraits were at one point used to illustrate the four single-player save file dossiers; this was also removed, with Pierce Brosnan's portrait appearing on all four in the final version.
Not all remnants of the All Bonds feature were completely removed from the GoldenEye software. One major clue was the fact that the portraits of the four Bonds in the selection screen for multiplayer mode were accessible by using a GameShark. Also, various screenshots in the game manual, such as one from the multiplayer selection screen, show traces of the former Bond portraits.
The feature was brought to the attention of many gamers when the gaming magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly published an April issue with what they called the ""All Bonds Cheat"", using some fake screenshots ""to support"" its claim. The magazine reported that to unlock the option in the cheat menu, a player must complete the Aztec mission on 007 difficulty in less than nine minutes with all customisable enemy settings on the highest difficulty. The claim was later found to be an April Fools prank, which the magazine held annually.
In 2005, a program called the GoldenEye ROM Editor was released by The Rare Witch Project. The coders SubDrag and Ice Mario cracked the compression format of the images used by the game, allowing any image in the game's memory to be viewed and edited, by opening up a ROM image of the game. It was then discovered that the All Bonds faces and suits are still in the game; Rare had only removed the ability to use them. By mapping them onto other multiplayer characters' faces and bodies, one can try to recreate All Bonds, although since the body and head shapes do not match the textures, it will not look as it was intended.
When GoldenEye 007 was released in 1997, its stealth elements and varied objectives contrasted with the approaches taken by Doom and Quake, and its split-screen deathmatch mode proved popular. These factors contributed to the game's commercial success, selling eight million copies.
In 1998, GoldenEye received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment ""Games Award"" and Rare won the award for ""Best UK Developer"". It also won four awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences: ""Console Action Game of the Year"", ""Console Game of the Year"", ""Interactive Title of the Year"" and ""Outstanding Achievement in Software Engineering"". Additionally, it was nominated for ""Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics"" and ""Outstanding Achievement in Interactive Design"".
In a January 2000 poll, readers of the long-running British video game magazine Computer and Video Games voted GoldenEye 007 into first place in a list of ""the hundred greatest video games"". In a poll in the next year, the game was ranked 5th. Also in 2001, Game Informer magazine ranked GoldenEye 007 16th in a list of the ""Top 100 Games of All Time"". In 2005, a ""Best Games of All-Time"" poll at GameFAQs placed GoldenEye 007 at 7th. In a list made by IGN in 2005, GoldenEye was ranked 29th while the Reader's Choice placed it at 7th.
The game originally received a ""nine out of ten"" score in Edge, with the magazine later stating that ""a ten was considered, but eventually rejected"". In the magazine's 10th anniversary issue in 2003, the game was included as one of their top ten shooters, along with a note that it was ""the only other game"" that should have received the prestigious ""ten out of ten"" rating.
Video game review site ScrewAttack rated GoldenEye number one on three different Top 10 lists, winning the title of ""Best FPS"", ""Best Movie Game"" and ""Best Local Multiplayer Game"".
On Game Rankings, GoldenEye 007 has been ranked number 5 on the voting average list with an average vote of 9.2.
The game continues to be played by fans, many of whom have developed online communities. There are those who enjoy replaying single-player levels in an attempt to achieve fast times, those who battle others in its deathmatch mode, while others use GameSharks and similar devices to examine and to modify the game's code. On October 25, 2006, a fansite, The Rare Witch Project, released a level editor that allows users to place objects and write AI routines for existing stages on a ROM image, so new stages can be developed.
The James Bond game license was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1999, which published new games based upon the then-recent James Bond films Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough. The latter game, along with others published by EA such as Agent Under Fire and Nightfire are similar in style to GoldenEye 007.
In the autumn of 2004, Electronic Arts released GoldenEye: Rogue Agent for Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and later the Nintendo DS. This is the first game based on the 007 franchise in which the player does not take on the role of James Bond himself; rather they control an aspiring 00-agent (named GoldenEye) who is recruited by Auric Goldfinger. The game has little to do with either the film GoldenEye or the N64 game. It was released to mediocre reviews, and was criticized for using the ""GoldenEye"" name in an attempt to exploit the success of Rare's game
In the aftermath of E3 2006 Activision obtained the rights for James Bond games from MGM and EON, and their first game Quantum of Solace was released on October 31, 2008 which was developed by Treyarch.
Reggie Fils-Aime, the President of Nintendo of America, announced that Nintendo is exploring the possibility of adding GoldenEye 007 to the Wii Virtual Console, despite a complicated situation in which the game's developer Rare is owned by Microsoft and the video game rights to the James Bond franchise are held by Activision. He stated, ""We would love to see it [on the Virtual Console], so we're exploring all the rights issues.""
On January 11, 2008, 1UP reported that a GoldenEye port had been in development at Rare for several months, but stated that the title would not be released on the Xbox Live Arcade since ""Microsoft and Nintendo couldn't agree on the financial side of things.""

211,/wiki/Gabriel_Adeka,"After studying at Rugby School, and Merton College in Oxford, Gabriel had a lucrative career as a lawyer.
Gabriel Adeka was a Zanzari lawyer of the Fakassa tribe when Civil War broke out between the Lowele tribe dominated government in the North, and the Fakassa in the south over oil reserves found beneath Fakassa lands. While Gabriel understood the Fakassa sentiment, he did not believe that secession was the way to deal with the issue, which lead to his falling out with his younger brother Solomon Adeka, who considered him a traitor.
In order to help relieve the thousands of starving people caught in the civil war, Gabriel left his job as a lawyer to start the charity AfricaKIN. He was visited in his Bayswater headquarters by James Bond, an alleged journalist trying to get an audience with Solomon. Gabriel told him that he could not help him, and went about his business until it was discovered that he was the rightful ruler of the Fakassa people, and thus his signature was required to get rights to the oil.
For this reason, Gabriel was killed and buried under a newly poured concrete floor in his Bayswater office to give the rights to Solomon.

212,/wiki/Corinne_Dufour,"As James Bond begins his investigation into the theft of a Moonraker space shuttle by meeting with its creator, Hugo Drax, he is collected from Los Angeles International airport by the industrialist's personal helicopter pilot, Corinne Dufour. She provides him with an aerial tour of Drax's property and flies him to his opulent Californian estate. After the meeting concludes, she escorts the spy to meet with Dr. Holly Goodhead. While staying at Drax's châteaux, Bond visits the seemingly innocent Corinne in her bedroom to elicit information. She hesitantly tells Bond what little she knows and they sleep together. During the night, Bond sneaks across the hall to investigate Drax's study. Corinne wakes and follows him there, telling him to get out of the office. She inadvertently reveals where the safe is located and stands by as Bond photographs the documents it contained.
Unfortunately for Corinne, she is unknowingly witnessed by Drax's henchman as she leaves the study. After Bond departs for Venice the following morning, Corinne is summoned by Drax while he is out hunting. He informs Corinne that her employment has been terminated due to her involvement in Bond's safe breaking the previous night. As Corinne walks away, Drax sets his trained hunting dogs onto her. She flees into the woods, where she is subsequently mauled to death. Bond apparently remains unaware of her demise.

213,/wiki/Colonel_Ping,"Suspecting that a third party was manipulating events to kill Stefan Pomerov, James Bond examines the Turkish courier's phone which had led him to the Russian industrialist. Beside several local phone calls, Bond observed that Bernin had received an unanswered international call before he died. Phoning the number, 007 discovers that Colonel Fu San Ping, an influential Chinese agent, had been attempting to contact the courier. Ping suggests an alliance and meets with Bond at an aquarium in Bangkok, Thailand.  At the aquarium, Ping asks Bond to complete one simple task before meeting in person: find and disable three audio surveillance bugs in the aquarium.  After Bond does so and meets with Ping at the whale exhibit, Ping reveals that an economic mercenary has been stealing dangerous technological secrets and selling them to the highest bidder. Related to this, he had a team in Geneva following a lead on a man called Rak who operates out of Bangkok. Before Ping can reveal more, an assassin kills him with a single bullet to the head.
In the Nintendo DS version of Blood Stone, the aquarium where Bond and Ping meet is a one-story building comprising of ten exhibits, with each one dedicated to a certain marine animal and connected by short tunnels.  The task that Ping asks Bond to complete to meet safely is to have him find and photograph secret fragments of a picture of a shark found on the glass of different tanks in the exhibits, which Bond puts together to determine that Ping is in the shark exhibit, where the two have their fateful meeting as usual.
At one point in the game, he is incorrectly referred to as ""General Ping"" when the objective prompts Bond to meet him at the aquarium after deactivating the bugs planted across the location. This is likely a leftover from an earlier incarnation of the game in which Ping was supposedly depicted as an older man than he was in the final form of the title.

214,/wiki/General_Orlov_(Steven_Berkoff),"Lieutenant-General Orlov was a fictional Soviet General and one of the two main antagonists in the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy (the other being Kamal Khan). He was portrayed by British actor Steven Berkoff. The character also appeared in the 1986 James Bond 007 tabletop role-playing game.
Orlov is a megalomaniacal Soviet General, he wears the rank insignia of a lieutenant-general, who believes that the Warsaw Pact has a decisive advantage over NATO in conventional military strength that is being tossed away by its leaders in détente. Rejecting their diplomacy, he advocates a massive military attack in Europe to seize dominance of the continent and call (what he thinks is) NATO's nuclear bluff. However, his proposal for a full-scale invasion of Europe is flatly rejected, with General Gogol being the loudest voice, in part because NATO would respond with nuclear strikes that would escalate the conflict to a global nuclear war. Gogol also seems to hold Orlov in contempt, feeling that his thirst for power is dangerous.
To eliminate that objection, Orlov's plan involves the detonation of an atomic bomb at a circus performance inside a United States Air Force base in West Germany. The effects of the bomb would be indistinguishable from American atomic bombs, and the explosion would be assumed to be an accident (as a nuclear strike would trigger the Air Force's early warning systems), prompting nuclear disarmament throughout the West and the East. Under Orlov's reasoning, with the nuclear factor taken out of the equation, the superior numbers of the Soviets would then be able to defeat the West without threat of nuclear reprisal, or even resistance, from NATO.
Orlov's accomplice in this scheme is Kamal Khan, an exiled Afghan prince involved in jewelry smuggling. He pays Khan by stealing priceless Fabergé eggs from state depositories and replacing them with counterfeits. He gets James Bond's attention when MI6 agent 009, who had been working undercover, is killed with one of the counterfeits in his possession in West Germany.
With Khan's employee, Octopussy, the pair plan to use the latter's circus as a front for smuggling the original jewellery. Instead of selling the jewellery in Switzerland and split the profit, they replace it with the atomic bomb to detonate en route in West Germany, which Octopussy is unaware of.
Bond eventually confronts Orlov and attempts to force him to stop the train carrying the bomb, but he is interrupted by Russian soldiers. Orlov and Bond both race to catch the train, with Bond unknowingly taking the General's car with the jewellery. Orlov commands his soldiers to pursue Bond's car, which crashes into a river just after 007 managed to jump onto the train.
Finally Orlov also catches up with the circus train. However, he is gunned down by a border guard while trying to jump onto its back, as he has forcibly crossed the border between East and West Germany. By this point, General Gogol had discovered Orlov's role in the smuggling by retrieving Orlov's car containing the jewellery from the river. When the arriving Gogol calls him ""a disgrace to the uniform"", the dying Orlov utters his last words: ""Yes, but tomorrow, I shall be a hero of the Soviet Union,"" unaware that James Bond is about to foil the scheme.
Orlov was completely insane, having a manic fixation with the USSR gaining complete power over Europe, as opposed to General Gogol, who preferred to make peace with the West. He was also incredibly psychotic, not caring that thousands of people would die due to his plan. He also had no qualms with betraying Octopussy for his plan to succeed. In addition, he seemed to have a short temper, frequently snapping at people while arguing with them, seen most prominently in his confrontations with both General Gogol and James Bond.

215,/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency,"The Central Intelligence Agency or CIA for short, is an intelligence-gathering agency of the United States government. As the U.S.'s primary intelligence agency, it is responsible for obtaining and analyzing information about foreign governments, corporations, and persons, and reporting such information to the branches of the U.S. government. 
It is also involved in covert Human Intelligence (HUMINT) espionage and paramilitary operations in support of its mission to protect the national security of the United States.  Given the alliance between the United States and the United Kingdom, the CIA often works alongside MI6.
The CIA is involved in many Bond films. James Bond's friend Felix Leiter turns up in many of them.

217,/wiki/Dr._Mortner_(Willoughby_Gray),"Dr. Carl Mortner, born Hans Glaub, was a fictional German geneticist who served Hitler and the Nazi regime during the Second World War. He later became the head scientist of wealthy businessman, Max Zorin. A major antagonist portrayed by British actor, Willoughby Gray, the character first appeared in the 1985 James Bond film, A View to a Kill, and was subsequently adapted for the 1983-87 tabletop role-playing game, James Bond 007: Role-Playing In Her Majesty's Secret Service.
Born Hans Glaub in 1913, at some point in his life he began a career in science, with an interest in breeding and genetics. His methods were akin to the infamous mad scientist Josef Mengele, who had little regard for human life, requesting the Nazis send some concentration camp subjects to him for purposes of experimentation, to be treated like lab rats. Hans Glaub's speciality was steroids and hormonal experimentation on pregnant women who were corraled into the concentration camps. Most of Glaub's experiments ended in failure, causing most of the experimented mothers to miscarry. However, a handful of women did successful deliver babies. These babies were often psycotic in nature, but grew into children with gifted intelligence. Glaub took an interest in such ""super kids"" one of whom was Max Zorin, whom he took special care.
Unlike many of his fellow Nazis, Glaub escaped facing justice at the Nuremburg Commission following the end of World War II. A Soviet military unit had attacked Glaub's facility during the war. Realizing Glaub's potential, the unit chose to transport him to the Soviet Union. Glaub spent fifteen years in the Soviet Union, where he was ordered to make steroids for their athletes. He fled the USSR sometime in the 1960s, taking Max Zorin with him. Glaub gave himself the false identity of ""Carl Mortner"" and resumed his work in genetics, now working on horses. He had discovered a way to make horses faster without doping. Glaub used Zorin's microchips in the brains of horses, which acted as receiver for a silver-tipped cane. Zorin used the cane as a remote control, pointing it at a running horse which would cause its brain to release adrenaline, and thus run faster. He covered up his activity by falsely claiming the horses got their abilities through complex selective breeding.
Then in May 1985, an MI6 agent, James Bond, began to sniff Zorin in their stable and Glaub intrigue a Bond's colleague, Sir Godfrey Tibbett. The doctor meet Bond as he leaves Max Zorin's study, pretending to be looking for the bar. As the doctor escorts Bond to where he should be, Bond asks him about how Zorin's horses always seem to win, and is introduced to another henchman, Bob Conley, and Zorin himself.
He later appears after Bond breaks into Zorin's lab and tells Zorin that 007 has been snooping around in places he shouldn't have been as he discovered that a microchip has been misplaced in the cabinet due to Bond's hastiness during his escape from the lab. 
Mortner subsequently travels to San Francisco and colludes in Zorin's plan to cause an artificial double-earthquake; permanently submerging Silicon Valley underwater and granting Zorin Industries a monopoly in microchip production. He meets his death shortly after Bond and Zorin have their final fight on the Golden Gate Bridge. He awakens after having been knocked unconscious by Stacey Sutton into the Zorin’s airship immediately before the fight. When Mortner sees Zorin fall to his death from the bridge, he reacts violently, pulling out a pistol and firing at Bond and Sutton in retaliation for the death of his adopted son. Once his pistol runs out of ammunition, he goes into a cabinet, pulls out a small bundle of dynamite, lights the fuse, and walks toward the cabin door, seeking to throw the dynamite at Bond and Sutton. Bond, however, uses Zorin's axe to cut through the rope anchoring the blimp to the bridge, causing Mortner to lose his balance and drop the dynamite in the cabin as the blimp floats away. Scarpine, who has just regained consciousness, panics and tries to wrestle the dynamite away from Mortner and extinguish the fuse, but it explodes while they are fighting over it, destroying the blimp's cabin and killing both of the men (who would have died when they fell into the San Francisco Bay even if they somehow survived the explosion).
"
218,/wiki/Aston_Martin_DBS,"The DBS was intended as the successor to the Aston Martin DB6, although the two ran concurrently for three years. Powered by a straight-6 engine, it was produced from 1967 until 1972, eventually being phased out in favour of the more powerful DBS V8 and the Aston Martin Vantage.
The DBS was intended to have a more ""modern"" look than the previous series of Aston models (the DB4 through DB6), and it incorporated a fastback style rear end and squared off front grille, atypical of Astons, but very much then in vogue in automotive design circles of the late sixties. Trademark Aston design features, such as a bonnet scoop, knock off wire wheels, and side air vents with stainless steel brightwork were however retained.
The DBS was used by James Bond in the 1969 film On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Although not used in any major action sequences the Aston Martin is driven by Bond in various scenes including the ending where the car is decorated with flowers for his wedding to Tracy. Two cars were lent by Aston Martin for the film; one was used for the studio scenes and a second for the exterior shots. Both cars were registered as GKX 8G.
Unlike Bond's previous car, the Aston Martin DB5, no gadgets were seen in the DBS other than a custom-built storage compartment. Neatly tucked away inside the passenger glove-box are, what appear to be, the disassembled components of an Armalite AR-7 survival rifle; a rifle stock, a suppressor, and a scope. Notably, the DBS also lacked the bullet-proof glass of its predecessor - in the final scenes of the film, Bond's new wife, Tracy, is shot and killed while sitting in the car.
The DBS also appears in a single scene in the subsequent Bond film, Diamonds are Forever (1971). The vehicle can be seen in the background of the Q-Branch workshop (being fitted with missiles of some kind) as Bond talks with Q on the telephone.
The car also appears in the Best of Bond DLC of the open world racing video game, Forza Horizon 4. Its base statistics (out of ten) are Speed 7.0, Handling 5.0, Acceleration 5.8, Launch 7.4, and Braking 5.0. As with all Forza vehicles, the DBS can be customized; with its 4.0L Naturally-Aspirated I6 capable of being changed to a 5.2L V10 or 6.2L V8 (510 hp) and its rear wheel drive (RWD) drivetrain changeable to all-wheel-drive (AWD). Players can also choose to modify various elements such as the rear bumpers and choose from twenty different shades of paint. Using interactive icons, players can examine under the bonnet, the boot, and inside its detailed interior. Unlike other James Bond themed vehicles such as the Aston Martin DB5, the DBS is not equipped with gadgets.

220,/wiki/Henry_Gupta,"Henry Gupta was a fictional American ""techno-terrorist"" in the employ of media baron Elliot Carver. A supporting antagonist portrayed by the late American stage magician, actor, and writer, Ricky Jay, the character first appeared in the 1997 James Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies, and was subsequently adapted in Raymond Benson's accompanying novelization as well in 1999 video game adaptation of the film.
Intent on starting a war between the United Kingdom and China, Elliot Carver sends Henry Gupta to a terrorist arms bazaar to purchase an American military GPS encoder. Using this device, Gupta meacons the GPS signal and sends the British frigate HMS Devonshire off-course into Chinese-held waters in the South China Sea, where Carver's stealth ship sinks the frigate with a sea drill and steals one of its missiles. Afterwards, his men shoot down a Chinese J-7 fighter jet sent to investigate the British presence, and kill the Devonshire's survivors with Chinese weaponry. After the Devonshire is sunk, Gupta is informed by Stamper that Phase 1 is complete.
When looking through the sound files of Carver's satellite launch event, Gupta hears Bond talking to Paris. When he shows Carver the footage, Carver decides to have his wife killed by Dr. Kaufman.
While infiltrating Carver's agency at Hamburg, Bond sneaks into Gupta's bureau and opens his safe, finding the GPS encoder inside and returning it back to the American military. He and his partner Wai Lin soon learn that Gupta has programmed the stolen missile to be launched into Beijing which will start off World War III and that Carver is planning to exploit the event to obtain China's broadcasting rights by having General Chang to take over as the new leader of China.
Sneaking aboard the ship with Lin after informing their governments about the plot, Bond takes Gupta hostage in front of Carver and his men. After a brief discussion with Bond about his plans, Carver asks Gupta if the missile is ready to fire. When Gupta says it is, Carver remarks, ""Then it seems you've outlived your contract"", and shoots Gupta, killing him. The terrorist's body is later vaporised when the Stealth Ship explodes.
In one of the deleted scenes of the film, Gupta throws some playing cards at a wall and they stick to it, which shows Gupta can partly fight. In another deleted scene when Bond was shooting up the place, Gupta tries to throw a card at Bond, but misses and hits a henchman instead.

222,/wiki/1935_Bentley_3%C2%BD_Litre,"The Bentley 3½ Litre was presented to the public in September 1933, shortly after the death of Henry Royce, and was the first new Bentley model following Rolls-Royce's acquisition of the Bentley brand in 1931. A drophead 1935 Bentley 3½ Litre was featured in the 1963 film From Russia with Love as James Bond's first Q Branch equipped vehicle.
Bentley sold only the bare rolling chassis with engine and gearbox, scuttle and radiator, ready for coachbuilders to construct on it a body to the buyer's requirements. Many distributors ordered their preferred bodies as showroom stock to enable them to stock finished cars ready for immediate sale.
Based on an experimental Rolls-Royce project ""Peregrine"" which was to have had a supercharged 2¾ L engine, the 3½ Litre was finally fitted with a less adventurous engine developed from Rolls' straight-6 fitted to the Rolls-Royce 20/25. The Bentley variant featured a higher compression ratio, sportier camshaft profile and two SU carburettors on a crossflow cylinder head. Actual power output was roughly 110 bhp (82 kW) at 4500 rpm, allowing the car to reach 90 mph (145 km/h). The engine displaced 3.7 L (3669 cc/223 in³) with a 3¼ in (82.5 mm) bore and 4½ in (114.3 mm) stroke.
A 4-speed manual transmission with synchromesh on 3rd and 4th, 4-wheel leaf spring suspension, and 4-wheel servo-assisted mechanical brakes were all common with other Rolls-Royce models. The chassis was manufactured from nickel steel, and featured a ""double-dropped"" layout to gain vertical space for the axles and thus keep the profiles of the cars low. The strong chassis needed no diagonal cross-bracing, and was very light in comparison to the chassis built by its contemporary competitors, weighing in at 2510 lb in driveable form ready for delivery to the customer's chosen coachbuilder.
1177 3½ Litre cars were built, with about half of them being bodied by Park Ward, with the remainder ""dressed"" by other coachbuilders like Barker, Freestone & Webb, Gurney Nutting, Hooper, wikipedia:Mann Egerton, Mulliner (both A and HJ), Rippon, Thrupp & Maberly, James Young, Vanden Plas and Windovers in England; Figoni, Kellner, Saoutchik and Vanvooren in Paris; and smaller concerns elsewhere in UK and Europe.
It is shown very briefly during Bond's first scene in From Russia with Love, as Bond uses its car phone to respond to a pager call from headquarters. Following this, it is mentioned only once again (very briefly) in Goldfinger. While the Bentleys of the novels are shown to be Bond's personal possessions, the film version of Goldfinger strongly implies that the Bentley was issued to Bond by Q-Branch. Arriving at Q-Branch, Bond asks where his Bentley is, only to have Q dismissively state ""Oh, it's had it's day I'm afraid."" Despite having reservations, Bond is issued with the Aston Martin DB5 instead. On ""M's orders"".

Similar to the grappling device concealed in James Bond's previous phone in the 2001 video game Agent Under Fire, the cellphone grapple was designed by Q to fire a retractable line used for scaling buildings. Like its predecessor, the line launcher is hidden in the top of the phone and will only attach to specific mounting points indicated by the presence of a 'hook' icon on the screen. The phone's appearance varies strongly between PC and console versions of the game. In the console versions, the device is a silver rectangular clamshell-style phone, with an external display on the outside. Inside, the device sported an electroluminescent keypad and blue monochrome LCD display. The model used for the PC variant was a silver compact flip phone more in keeping with Bond's previous phone in Agent Under Fire. It had a green back-lit LCD screen and an spring-loaded latch mechanism to release the 'flip'. Both versions of the device featured external antennae.

228,/wiki/Agent_Fields,"Strawberry Fields was a fictional intelligence operative working for the British Secret Service and affiliated to the British consulate in Bolivia. The character was the secondary Bond girl in the 2008 James Bond film, Quantum of Solace, and was portrayed by British actress, Gemma Arterton.
When James Bond takes it upon himself to work away from orders, following Dominic Greene to Bolivia, Fields is assigned the job of stopping Bond, turning him around and putting him back on the first plane back to London.
Waiting for Bond and his ally René Mathis at La Paz airport, Fields is quick to assert herself over the British MI6 agent. However, Bond still feels he can take advantage due to her younger age. Shooting down Bond's sarcasm, Fields threatens to leave Bond in jail over night until their flight back to London the following morning. Bond doesn't hesitate to argue against Fields' threats. However, he tells her they still have ""all night"".
Getting a taxi to a cheap hostel, Fields informs Bond and Mathis that they are undercover as teachers on sabbatical. Bond demands that she gets back into the taxi, which she does after a second thought. Bond then checks the three into the Andean Grand Hotel, a five-star resort in the city center of Bolivia. When paired in a room with Bond, she succumbs to his charms and sleeps with him.
Feeling guilty about sleeping with Bond, Fields tells him she doesn't think she can ever forgive herself. Bond kissed her all over the back trying his charms once again and trying to cheer her up, Bond offers to take her to a party Mathis has recently got invited too, the host of which being Dominic Greene. Fields agrees to the offer and the pair travel together, she said that she had nothing to wear, Bond replied that it was not a problem, putting her to bed and  she called Bond again to get hold of her and  they had sex again. 
While at the party, Bond and Fields watch Greene's environmentally targeted speech and are introduced to Colonel Carlos, the Bolivian Chief of Police, who is secretly a double agent working for the corrupt General Medrano. When Bond leaves Fields with Carlos and Mathis, she keeps a watchful eye on Bond's movements. Noticing tensions rising between Bond, Camille Montes and Dominic Greene, she decides to confront, but as she walks up the stairs, she realizes she must make a choice: still work to order and stop Bond from leaving with Camille or help Bond on his quest by allowing him to leave. Choosing the latter, when Greene orders his henchman Elvis to follow Bond and Camille, Fields trips him up down the stairs, allowing Bond to flee but drawing attention to herself.
Sometime after leaving the party, Fields clearly knows she is being followed by Greene's henchmen. After leaving a note at the reception of the hotel for Bond saying ""Run!"", Fields' fate is soon cemented when she is discovered by M lying naked on the bed in the hotel room, her dead body covered in oil. When Bond arrives back, he tells M that the use of oil is misdirection from Greene as he is in fact planning on controlling Bolivia's water supply. Managing to break free from M's guards escorting Bond from the premises, the spy confronts M, telling her that Fields showed true bravery and he demands to see that act written in her final report.
In an act of poetic justice at the end, Bond leaves Greene stranded in the middle of the desert with nothing but a can of engine oil to drink.

232,/wiki/Gustav_Graves_(Toby_Stephens),"Founder and owner of the Graves CorporationColonel Tan-Sun Moon, later known as Sir Gustav Graves, was a fictional North Korean military colonel who attempted to unite the Korean peninsula under his county's flag. After his presumed death at the hands of James Bond, he changed his appearance to infiltrate the society he intended to destroy; becoming a charismatic diamond magnate.
Portrayed jointly by Korean-American actor, Will Yun Lee, (as Moon) and British actor, Toby Stephens, (as Graves) the character served as the main antagonist of the 2002 James Bond film, Die Another Day. He was also featured in Raymond Benson's accompanying novelisation and was re-imagined for Activision's 2012 James Bond video game, 007 Legends.
Born the son General Moon, Tan-Sun Moon was a Colonel (Sangchwa) in the North Korean People's Army. In a hope that a Western education would help bridge the gap between East and West, General Moon sent his son to study at Oxford and Harvard. It was an experience which would prove formative on the young Moon, providing him with the contacts which he would later use; including Miranda Frost who was on also on the Harvard fencing team. He was able to bring Frost to his side by arranging her to win the Olympic Gold Medal in fencing by implicating her competitor for using steroids. General Moon would later regret the decision, coming to believe that his son had become corrupted by the ideas and greed of the West.
A radical and a dealer in hi-tech weaponry, Moon conducted various illicit operations in diamond  smuggling to fund his private army and ambitions to forcibly unite the two Koreas. He had his base set up in the middle of the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. He also had assistance from a fellow Korean officer named Tang Lin Zao. MI6 becomes aware of his activities, however, and dispatches three agents, including James Bond, to assassinate Moon by intercepting and replacing a diamond smuggler named Van Bierk.
When Zao finds out that Bond is in truth a British spy sent to kill him, Moon uses to destroy the helicopter Bond arrived in with one of his high-tech weapons, called Tankbuster, killing the two remaining agents. Before he can kill Bond too, Moon is told that General Moon is about to arrive at the base. The Colonel and his men then quickly leave the base with the hovercrafts and weapons, so that his father doesn't find out about his weapon dealing. He leaves Bond to be shot by his men but the agent escapes by blowing up the diamond suitcase, having implanted a bomb earlier, and fleeing with the last remaining hovercraft. Pursuing Moon, Bond has to fight off many Korean soldiers while being shot at by Moon with his Tankbuster and a flamethrower.
Eventually jumping onto Moon's hovercraft, Bond attacks the young military and the two fight long enough for the hovercraft to reach a cliff. Without a pilot to steer it the hovercraft drives right over the cliff into the river far below. Bond is able to jump off in time, but Moon is dragged over the cliff and presumed deceased. Right after, Bond is arrested by General Moon and his soldiers, and brought to a North Korean torture camp where he is brutally interrogated for before being exchanged for Zao, who had been arrested by the British.
Unknown to the rest of the world - including his own father - Moon survives the incident and flees to Cuba, where he undergoes DNA replacement therapy (provided by Dr. Alvarez) to alter his appearance to make him appear to be of European descent. Emerging from the therapy, he completed his transformation and adopted the name Gustav Graves.
Gustav Graves was seen as a sophisticated, sarcastic, rude and arrogant business man. In a conversation with Bond later in the film, he admits that he modelled this new identity after him. He portrays himself to the world as an ecologist, fencing champion and adrenaline junkie, with a penchant for speed—activities which he has plenty of time for, given that the gene therapy has robbed him of the ability to sleep.
His official story was that he was an orphan who worked in diamond mines in Argentina; from there, he learned engineering and founded the Graves Corporation. He discovered a great mine of diamonds in Iceland and made a huge fortune. With that fortune, Graves developed Icarus - a satellite which harnesses solar energy and focuses it, ""gently"", over the Earth, supposedly putting an end to famine and poverty. In reality, his fortune was made using a fake diamond mine as a front for laundering African conflict diamonds and his Icarus satellite is a super-weapon. The main purpose of Icarus was to blast its way through the heavily-fortified demilitarized zone, providing a pathway for the invading North Korean forces and bringing about Korean unification.
Brought on Graves' trace through blood diamonds he found with Zao, Bond - unaware of Graves' true identity - travels to London, where he witnesses Graves arriving at the Buckingham Palace by parachute before he is knighted by the Queen. Later that day, Bond visits the fencing academy where Graves is training and manages to persuade the fight trainer Verity to arrange a match with Graves. When being introduced to Graves, the villain asks whether they have met before, to which Bond responds by stating he would remember. Graves admits that he is mistaking. Driven by their arrogance, both men then engage in their training match, betting money on the outcome. When Graves asks Bond if he still wants to continue, Bond proposes to up the wager, showing him one of the blood diamonds he got from Zao.
When continuing their fight, Bond cuts Graves at the hand, pausing their fight to continue. When Bond mockingly-affably asks Graves whether he wants to continue, Graves responds that of course he wants to ""bloody continue"", but proposes that they use real swords and fight till first blood drawn from the torso. They engage in a furious duel, where both men are cut multiple times. Fighting their way through the club, changing their weapons multiple times. Eventually hammering at each others with medieval claymores, they continue their fight in the outer parts of the club, with Bond finally cutting Graves at the stomach, thereby throwing him into a fountain. Graves emerges furiously but before he can continue the fight, Miranda Frost stops them. Graves laughs and admits that Bond beat him and the men shake hands. Before they leave, Graves, as a token of good sportsmanship, invites Bond to his Icarus demonstration in Iceland at the next weekend.
When Bond arrives at Graves' Ice Palace at Iceland, a palace made from pure ice only built for the demonstration of Icarus, he is greeted by Graves and his security head Mr. Kil. While the guests entertain themselves inside, Graves is using his dream machine. He is interrupted by a man who is revealed to be Zao. Seeing his old friend for the first time after Zao's departure, Graves looks at his unfinished face and asks him who did that. Zao responds that it is Bond's work and Graves gleefully tells him that he has met Bond and Bond did not recognize him at all. Graves then asks Zao of news of his father and Zao tells him that General Moon still mourns his death.
The guests are then called for the presentation. Graves then presents Icarus, telling them that it will be used to bring light to the darkest places on earth and is able to warm even the coldest places to grow crops, therefor being a mean to end world hunger. He then uses Icarus to illuminate the entire palace, causing giant applause from the guests.
When NSA agent Jinx, who has also reached Island, breaks into the complex where Graves' chambers are located to kill Graves, she expects to find him under the dream machine's mask. However, when she takes the mask off, Zao looks at her and Graves attacks her from behind, wearing the prototype of his Icarus suit.
After saving Jinx from Zao, Bond heads to Graves' office where he waits for his old enemy. When Graves arrives, Bond tells him that he knows his true identity, based on Zao's presence and the lack of alternative explanations for the dream machine's presence. Graves mocks him, telling him he thought that Bond would never get it. He then reveals to Bond that while they only met briefly, Bond had made a lasting impression on him, causing him to model his new identity Gustav Graves after the MI6 agent. Miranda then arrives, holding her weapon at Graves. Graves remarks seemingly defeated that Miranda seems to be not the one she claims to be. Bond agrees, but then Graves asks whether he has found out who betrayed him in North Korea and if it never occurred to him to look inside MI6. Miranda then aims her gun at Bond, revealing herself as the traitor. Graves also reveals that he knows of Jinx and says that a tragedy will befall her soon.
When Bond is about to be killed, Bond goads Zao into hitting him into stomach in order to allow him to fall to the ground. Using a special ring he got from MI6's quartermaster, he breaks the glass panel that covers the entire floor in order to fall into the lower floor. As Bond runs off, Graves orders Zao to follow and kill him but Bond escapes with Graves' speeder, driving off into the ice plains at insane speed. When Zao returns and tells Graves that Bond escaped, Graves decides to unleash Icarus.
He orders Zao to bring the three North Korean generals (Dong, Li & Han) that were underneath the guests and tells them that he will demonstrate them the full power of Icarus. He then has Icarus produce a gargantuan heat beam, which Bond can only escape because of his vehicle's enormous speed. When Bond drives off a cliff, hanging there only on the breaking hook of the speeder, Graves has Icarus cut off the entire cliff. Though Bond survives, Graves believes him to be dead.
Preparing to return to North Korea, Graves leaves Zao at the palace to oversee the final preparations. He, Miranda and most of his men then leave the palace, leaving Zao only with a minimal force. Returning to the palace for Jinx, Bond sees their escape plane arrive. On the plane, Graves uses Icarus to destroy his ice palace, destroying any evidence left. After this, he tells his engineer Vlad to complete the Icarus suit.
Having fled to a North Korean airbase, Graves plans to use Icarus to destroy the minefield in the demilitarized zone, allowing North Korean forces to attack the South. As General Moon wouldn't allow this war, the hardliners staged a coup and put the general under arrest. Bond and Jinx are sent to stop Graves.When the USA sends a missile to destroy Icarus, Graves uses the satellite's power to disintegrate it mid-air.
Unable to assassinate Graves at the airbase, Jinx and Bond are forced to board Graves' plane. On-board the plane, Graves and the generals are inside a planning room, where Graves admires the finished Icarus suit. He tells his men to have his father brought down. When General Moon arrives, Graves addresses him, but as his face is changed General Moon does not recognize him. When Moon tells him that he does not now him, Graves says that Moon always found it difficult to accept him, which made his exile easier to bear. He then quotes his father, which makes Moon realises that the man next to him is his son. However, he is deeply shocked, asking what his son did to himself. Graves then tells his father to watch the rising of his son and activates Icarus to destroy the minefield. However, opposed to Graves, Moon is disgusted by the heat beam as he knows this would mean war, with the Americans presumably sending nuclear warheads.
Finally realizing what his son has become, Moon grabs a gun from General Han and points it at his son's head. Graves asks his father whether he would kill his own son. When Moon claims that his son died long ago, Graves disarms him with the electricity glove of his Icarus suit and shoots him. He then sees Bond walking towards him and about to shoot him, but a henchman intervenes and the bullet hits the plane's window instead, causing it to break, sucking out everyone except Bond and Graves.
Graves and Bond then fight in the remains of the room, with Graves eventually overpowers Bond with his shock glove, Graves takes the plane's two parachutes and throws one out of the window. Intending to leave Bond to die in the plane crash, Graves kneels down next to Bond for one last gloat.
As he leans over the fallen spy to gloat, 007 reaches out and yanks the parachute's release cord; causing Graves to be pulled through a hole in the fuselage. As Moon desperately clings onto the edge of the chassis, Bond reaches out and activates the suit's electric defenses causing Moon to shock himself. He loses his grip and is sucked - along with the controls for the Icarus - into the Autonov's jet engine. With the destruction of his suit, Icarus is rendered harmless.
Gustav Graves also appears in 007 Legends in the Die Another Day mission. He has the likeness of is and voiced by Toby Stephens, but no reference is made to his past as Colonel Moon, implying that he was born Gustav Graves. The only exception to this theory is that a bust of Colonel Moon's head can be seen on Graves's cargo plane. Although he is shown wearing his North Korean uniform underneath his armor, his collar cuffs are absent.
While an original character, the character of Gustav Graves incorporates a number of elements from Ian Fleming's original novel Moonraker. In that novel, a Nazi adopts a new identity and becomes a popular British multi-millionaire. He then donates millions to create a ""Moonraker"" missile which is supposed to be for Britain's protection but is actually meant to destroy London. In addition, the club called Blades, a fencing club in this film, was featured as a gentleman's club in Moonraker. The name Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is a homage to the first official James Bond novel written after Ian Fleming's death, Colonel Sun by Robert Markham (Kingsley Amis).

244,/wiki/Gert_Fr%C3%B6be,"Gert Fröbe (1913-1988) was a German actor who is famous by portraying Auric Goldfinger, the main antagonist in the 1964 film, Goldfinger, starring Sean Connery as James Bond.
Gert Fröbe (born Karl-Gerhart Froeber) was born in Saxony, Germany in 1912. In his lifetime Fröbe performed in over 100 film productions and came into the western public eye after his menacing role in 1964's Goldfinger as the title character. Before this role, Fröbe was an established actor in his first language, but contrary to the character, Fröbe was a jolly and humorous man and comedy was his natural forté. On the James Bond production the dubbing artist Nikki van der Zyl taught Fröbe to recite his English lines. He was, however, ultimately dubbed in the final cut of the film.
After his introduction to the western world in Goldfinger, Fröbe performed in another Broccoli film, the film adaptation of Ian Fleming's children's novel Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
Other notable productions included 1965's Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines and numerous German language films.
An early script for Diamonds are Forever was to not to have Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Instead, the villain was to have been Auric Goldfinger's twin brother, but the idea was dismissed as too campy. Had this made it to shooting, Gert Fröbe would have been cast in the role.
His final screen appearance was The Little Vampire in 1986. Fröbe played the lead role of Detective Geiermeier in this German horror flick. Fröbe passed away in Barvaria, Germany on the 5th of September 1988. His legendary performance as the villainous Goldfinger remains today, a fan-favourite Bond moment.

Blofeld's solicitor, Gebrüder Gumbold, eventually conveys his client's willingness to meet the genealogist face-to-face. Initially reluctant to countenance deception, Sir Hilary agrees to lend his identity to 007 due to the matter's national importance.

250,/wiki/Auric_Goldfinger_(Literary),"In the novel, Auric Goldfinger is the richest man in England and the treasurer of SMERSH, Bond's nemesis. Goldfinger's passion is gold. He is also a jeweler, a metallurgist, and a smuggler.
When Goldfinger first meets James Bond in Miami, he claims that he is agoraphobic; a ploy to allow him to cheat a previous acquaintance of Bond's at a game of two-handed Canasta. Bond figures out how Goldfinger is managing this cheating and blackmails him by forcing him to admit his deception. Goldfinger is also an avid golfer, but is known at his club for being a smooth cheater. When Bond contrives to play a match with Goldfinger, he again cheats the cheater by switching Goldfinger's Dunlop One with a Dunlop Seven he had found while playing.
Goldfinger is the owner of ""Enterprises Auric A.G."" in Switzerland, maker of metal furniture, which is bought by many airlines including Air India. A few times during the year, Goldfinger drives his Rolls Royce ""Silver Ghost"" car from England to Enterprises Auric. Bond learns that Goldfinger makes repeated dead drops of gold bars along the way and that his car's bodywork is 18 carat (75%), solid white gold under the ploy that the added weight is armor plating. Once at Enterprises Auric, his car is stripped down, melted and made into furniture (seating) for an airline company that Enterprises Auric is heavily invested in. The plane(s) are then flown to India where the seats are melted down again into gold bars and sold for a much higher premium rate; 100 to 200% profit.

Operation Grand Slam is Goldfinger's codename for his scheme that involves ""knocking off"" the U.S. bullion depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Through the use of a chemical created by the Germans during World War II, Goldfinger plans to poison the water supply at Fort Knox, thus rendering everyone on the base (60,000) dead. From there Goldfinger would use an atomic bomb he had purchased for one million USD to blow open Fort Knox's impregnable vault. With the help of American gangsters, Goldfinger would then remove roughly 15 billion dollars in gold bullion and escape.
James Bond foils Goldfinger's plan by getting word to Felix Leiter of the impending operation. With the help of The Pentagon, Leiter was able to stop Goldfinger, and foil the operation. But Goldfinger escapes. Goldfinger met his end while trying to escape to the Soviet Union. After taking the plane Bond was on for himself and intending to escape the authorities, Bond escapes. After the spy kills Oddjob, Goldfinger appears and a violent struggle ensues. James Bond eventually strangles the man.
In addition to Henchmen, Goldfinger enlisted the help of several American gangsters. All of the gangsters that participated in Operation Grand Slam were subsequently shot when the operation failed, but Goldfinger enlisted Pussy Galore's help in exacting his revenge on Bond, which ultimately failed. One of the gangsters, Helmut Springer, backed out of the deal and did not participate i Goldfinger's Operation Grand Slam. Moments later, Mr. Springer had an ""accident"", falling down the staircase as he was leaving. In fact, he was killed by Oddjob.
His first name, Auric, is an adjective meaning of gold. Ian Fleming chose the name to commemorate the architect Erno Goldfinger who had built his home in Hampstead next door to Fleming; Fleming disliked Goldfinger's style of architecture and destruction of Victorian terraces and decided to name a memorable villain after him. The architect was not pleased to find the character sharing his name and contacted his lawyers; he eventually settled for, among other things, the promise that the character's first name Auric would always be used.

251,/wiki/Bentley_3%C2%BD_Litre,"The Bentley 3½ Litre was presented to the public in September 1933, shortly after the death of Henry Royce, and was the first new Bentley model following Rolls-Royce's acquisition of the Bentley brand in 1931. A drophead 1935 Bentley 3½ Litre was featured in the 1963 film From Russia with Love as James Bond's first Q Branch equipped vehicle.
Bentley sold only the bare rolling chassis with engine and gearbox, scuttle and radiator, ready for coachbuilders to construct on it a body to the buyer's requirements. Many distributors ordered their preferred bodies as showroom stock to enable them to stock finished cars ready for immediate sale.
Based on an experimental Rolls-Royce project ""Peregrine"" which was to have had a supercharged 2¾ L engine, the 3½ Litre was finally fitted with a less adventurous engine developed from Rolls' straight-6 fitted to the Rolls-Royce 20/25. The Bentley variant featured a higher compression ratio, sportier camshaft profile and two SU carburettors on a crossflow cylinder head. Actual power output was roughly 110 bhp (82 kW) at 4500 rpm, allowing the car to reach 90 mph (145 km/h). The engine displaced 3.7 L (3669 cc/223 in³) with a 3¼ in (82.5 mm) bore and 4½ in (114.3 mm) stroke.
A 4-speed manual transmission with synchromesh on 3rd and 4th, 4-wheel leaf spring suspension, and 4-wheel servo-assisted mechanical brakes were all common with other Rolls-Royce models. The chassis was manufactured from nickel steel, and featured a ""double-dropped"" layout to gain vertical space for the axles and thus keep the profiles of the cars low. The strong chassis needed no diagonal cross-bracing, and was very light in comparison to the chassis built by its contemporary competitors, weighing in at 2510 lb in driveable form ready for delivery to the customer's chosen coachbuilder.
1177 3½ Litre cars were built, with about half of them being bodied by Park Ward, with the remainder ""dressed"" by other coachbuilders like Barker, Freestone & Webb, Gurney Nutting, Hooper, wikipedia:Mann Egerton, Mulliner (both A and HJ), Rippon, Thrupp & Maberly, James Young, Vanden Plas and Windovers in England; Figoni, Kellner, Saoutchik and Vanvooren in Paris; and smaller concerns elsewhere in UK and Europe.
It is shown very briefly during Bond's first scene in From Russia with Love, as Bond uses its car phone to respond to a pager call from headquarters. Following this, it is mentioned only once again (very briefly) in Goldfinger. While the Bentleys of the novels are shown to be Bond's personal possessions, the film version of Goldfinger strongly implies that the Bentley was issued to Bond by Q-Branch. Arriving at Q-Branch, Bond asks where his Bentley is, only to have Q dismissively state ""Oh, it's had it's day I'm afraid."" Despite having reservations, Bond is issued with the Aston Martin DB5 instead. On ""M's orders"".

252,/wiki/003_(Reflections_of_Death),"In November 2020, Miss Moneypenny related an event involving a 003 to her captor during a drug-assisted interrogation. The operative had ostensibly been captured and taken to an irradiated prison complex in Olgetsk; a black site trafficking in intelligence assets. James Bond had first met the spy, who acted as a mentor, ten years earlier in Tangier. Attempting to break him out of Olgetsk, Bond allowed himself to be caught and was thrown in a cell with him. Unbeknownst to 007, the spy had gone rogue and was part of the site's senior management - encouraging others to give up secrets to their captors. Feigning madness, 003 proved a hinderance and Bond was forced to escape without him. Later, Olgetsk was raided by the SAS and  003 was taken captive whilst attempting to leave the island with roughly ten million in cryptocurrency. He was subsequently incarcerated at Hellsworth Prison. As a possible unreliable narrator, the veracity of Moneypenny's tale is unclear.

It was performed by The London Studio Session Orchestra conducted by John Altman. The film's eponymous theme song was sung by Tina Turner and written by U2's Bono and The Edge. The album was released on compact disc and cassette by Virgin Records on 27th November 1997, with a remastered CD edition subsequently released on 25th February 2003.
The theme song, ""GoldenEye"", was written by Bono and The Edge, and was performed by Tina Turner. The Swedish group Ace Of Base were also involved at one point, producing a song also called ""GoldenEye"". This song was later released with slightly revised lyrics as The Juvenile on their 2002 album Da Capo. In addition to the Bondian bass line, it seems that the lyric 'The Juvenile' simply replaced 'The GoldenEye'. The other lyrics, most notably the line ""Tomorrow's foe is now a friend"" obviously refer to the plot of this film.
The film features the song Stand By Your Man by American country music singer-songwriter Tammy Wynette. While not included on the film's CD soundtrack, the song is sung by Minnie Driver in a scene where Bond confronts Russian gangster Valentin Zukovsky in his St. Petersburg nightclub. Intended to be a comic moment, Driver intentionally sings the song off-key in an exaggerated Russian accent.

Notable figures included British diplomat Reginald Griffin and Dr. Natalya Damescu took refuge in the building. The facility appears in two levels of the 2001 James Bond video game Agent Under Fire; ""Bad Diplomacy"" and ""Night of the Jackal"".
In Hong Kong, James Bond recovers nine blood samples, eight of which contained blood of world leaders. One contains the blood of British diplomat Reginald Griffin, serving in a British embassy in Bucharest, Romania, who is obsessed with protecting a room, outside his jurisdiction, in the embassy. 007 covertly investigates the embassy, and inadvertently meets the CEO of Malprave Industries, Adrian Malprave, after entering a third-floor bedroom. He acts like a lost security guard and pockets a nearby security card. In an adjacent locked room, he discovers that Griffin has been tortured to death and is attacked by the diplomat's doppelganger. After overcoming the clone, Bond finds an audio message from Identicon Corporation CEO, Nigel Bloch, on Griffin's computer that mentions delivery of ""Defective Merchandise"" to Malprave Industries, based in Switzerland. Bond takes the information from the computer and escapes. Later analysis of the message reveals ""Defective Merchandise"" to be a codename for Dr. Natalya Damescu, formerly in the employ of Malprave, now under protection at the same British embassy in Bucharest. She also has inside information to offer. Subsequently, Carla the Jackal, an infamous terrorist who also killed CIA agent Zoe Nightshade, leads a raid on the embassy. Bond fights the terrorists before running into Damescu. After a confrontation with the Jackal, Bond kills her and later recovers Damescu's data chip detailing something known as ""Poseidon"".

Originally owned by the Royal Norwegian Navy, the HNoMS Vargr was decommissioned and subsequently purchased by a German shell company owned by Serbian biologist, Slaven Kurjak. Ostensibly the vessel had been bought for use in live action role-playing, but in reality had been converted into a laboratory for the production of the lethal narcotic, ""Green"". After tracking Kurjak and his men to Florø, 007 scuttled the ship using plastic explosives.
"
256,/wiki/Fisher,"Fisher was the fictional contact of corrupt MI6 section chief Dryden who was notable as the first man to be killed by James Bond and the first of two kills required in order for Bond to qualify for 00-status. A minor antagonist, the character appeared in the flashback of the pre-title sequence of EON Productions' 2006 film Casino Royale, portrayed by British actor Darwin Shaw.
Little is known about Fisher but it is assumed that he is involved in Dryden's plot to sell MI6 secrets on the black market. Sadly for the two, M discover their trickery and sends James Bond to kill them. The recruit tracks Fisher to a cricket match in Lahore, Pakistan. As Fisher spectates, he suddenly notices Bond shadowing him amongst the crowd of observers. Unnerved, the contact attempts to flee through the building, snatching his pistol from the changing rooms and proceeding into the adjoining restroom, where he chases out an innocent bystander at gunpoint. Suddenly, Bond bursts through the restroom door and wrestles the pistol from the thug's hand, smacking him into and through several toilet cubicles as both men fight for their lives. Eventually, Bond gains the upper hand, throwing Fisher hard against the wall and knocking him to the ground. Pulling him to his feet, he drags Fisher to a nearby sink and attempts to drown him. After several seconds of struggling, the man's body goes limp and crumples to the floor. However, Fisher is feigning his death and as Bond turns to retrieve his sidearm from the floor, the thug snatches his own weapon and takes aim. With lightning-fast reflexes, Bond turns and shoots first. Silhouetted against the white tiles and shot from the perspective of Fisher's gun barrel, this is shown on screen as a modified version of the traditional Gun barrel sequence and leads into the film's opening credits.
Although the cricket's scene where Bond notices Fisher have been cut in the film's final version, both script and deleted footage of the film show this.

258,/wiki/Hepworth_Blade,"Intelligence operativeSecret Intelligence ServiceHepworth Maximilian Blade was a fictional munitions magnate and owner of international weapons manufacturer, Blade-Rise Industries. The character served as a hidden ally in Steve Cole's 2016 Young Bond novel, Strike Lightning, and was subsequently mentioned in its 2017 sequel, Red Nemesis.
Charismatic and ruthless, Blade was the owner of international weapons company Blade-Rise. He suffered from the rare genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (or ""Stone Man Syndrome""), which caused his muscles, tendons and ligaments to slowly turn to bone. Doctors estimated he would be dead by the time he reached forty. His frustration at his body's fragility led him to conceive the idea of a strength-enhancing exoskeletal suit with the help of Dr. Randolph Whittaker. The suit proved to be an extremely complicated and costly machine. Rather than pool resources with a competitor in the arms trade, Blade turned to the British government circa 1918–33. Realizing that Germany had already secretly begun rearmament in violation of the Treaty of Versailles, they authorised Blade to sell weaponry to Germany; allowing him to make valuable contacts that helped their Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) monitor the scale of German ambition. In addition the Germans would unwittingly contribute towards the cost of developing a secret weapon for Britain - Blade-Rise's exo-suit, the ""Steel Shadow"".
It was subsequently decided that four Steel Shadows would also be sold to the Germans in an act of subterfuge. In order to locate German weapons research laboratories for SIS, each segment of the Steel Shadow's outer skeleton would house a concealed radio transmitter. The intelligence gleaned could be used to strike the research centres - setting Germany's war effort back years. Unbeknownst to Blade, the Germans acquired exclusive rights to the Steel Shadows to prevent others from creating similar technology. Meanwhile, they secretly created their own exo-suits based on their design – dubbed the Blutbanner, or Blood Flag. The Steel Shadow was developed at multiple covert locations; with research conducted on a temporary basis at Scottish schools such as Glenalmond, Loretto, Merchiston, and Fettes College. Combat testing was carried out at Thornhill Abbey in Stirling. Unintended fatalities which resulted were covered up to maintain secrecy. One such occasion on 29th November 1934, a high-voltage electrical test conducted at Fettes College, claimed the life of a student and aroused the suspicions of the young James Bond.

Meyers built all their aircraft by hand, so this model was not suitable for mass production. Production was cancelled in 1968.
Helga Brandt uses a white Aero Commander 200 to fly James Bond from Kobe to Tokyo. The plane belongs to Osato Chemicals and Engineering (since it has the company logo on it), and is registered as 'OS-7429'. The registration OS does not exist. Using a flare hidden inside a lipstick, Brandt sends the plane on a crash course, and traps Bond with a wooden plank on the back seat, before leaving by parachute.

273,/wiki/Colt_Army_Special,"The Colt Army Special was a pistol designed by Colt to replace the various over-complicated models of Colt New Army and New Navy revolvers. It was in production from 1908 to 1927 in hopes of securing a military contract. The United States Army instead adopted the Colt M1909 New Service revolver in .45 Long Colt and later the Colt M1911 Self-Loading pistol in the .45 ACP cartridge after extensive trials. It soon became apparent that the military were not likely to adopt a .38-caliber revolver in large numbers.
However, there was still a lot of interest in the pistol from the American Law Enforcement community, which were usually armed with .32-caliber revolvers. To that end it was renamed the Colt Official Police in 1927 and was in production under that name until 1969. To set it apart from the Army model the bluing was in a bright rather than matte finish, checkering was added to the trigger, and the v-notch rear sight was widened. The topstrap was treated with a matte finish to reduce glare.
During World War Two, Colt had two major contracts for the Official Police.
From 1940 to 1941 the British Government purchased a large number through Lend Lease as a substitute for the Enfield No. 2. They were stock models chambered in .38 Smith & Wesson (AKA British Service .38/200) that had a 5-inch barrel, checkered wooden grips, and a lanyard ring.
In 1942 the US Government procured a simplified version of the Official Police, initially for use by Military Policemen and security guards, that was dubbed the Colt Commando. It had a 4-inch barrel and plastic ""Coltwood"" grips, lacked the checkering on the trigger, hammer, and cylinder latch and the anti-glare treatment on the topstrap, and had a Parkerized finish. The Ordnance Corps' ""Flaming Bomb"" property mark was embossed on the left-hand side of the frame. A snub-nosed version with a 2-inch barrel dubbed the Junior Commando was used by intelligence personnel.
In Moonraker, Bond has a 6-inch barreled Army Special stowed in a holster mounted in the glove compartment of his 1930 Bentley. It might also be the revolver concealed under the driver's seat in his Aston Martin DB Mark III in Goldfinger. He carries a similar revolver in the short story From a View to a Kill.  
Bond's revolver is erroneously described as chambered in .45 Long Colt [11.5 x 33mm R]. This means Fleming, who wasn't well-versed with firearms, didn't realize the Army Special didn't chamber the high-powered round. Either that or he might have confused the Army Special with the larger-framed M1873 Single Action Army or M1909 New Service.

The president of the Central American state of Isthmus, Hector Lopez and many other high-ranking figures were bribed and intimidated into becoming thralls of drug baron Franz Sanchez and his cartel. The puppet regime helped Sanchez to maintain a legitimate image in the international community (but barely) and placed many of the country's resources at his disposal. It is evident Lopez is unhappy with his presidency, but Sanchez has tolerated him for the time being. Lopez is first seen meeting with Sanchez at the Casino de Isthmus, complaining that his bribe was only half its usual amount. Sanchez coldly reminds Lopez of his silence during the drug lord's incarceration in the United States and states that he is only ""president for life"". Following Sanchez's death and the collapse of his cartel, Lopez is later seen at a party in Sanchez's residence to celebrate his freedom from Sanchez's influence. There James Bond sets him up as a couple with the drug lord's former mistress, Lupe Lamora. From Bond's casual reference to him as 'el Presidente', it is implied that Lopez continued as president of Isthmus.

After an absence from the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale and its 2008 sequel Quantum of Solace, 2012's Skyfall reintroduces the character for Daniel Craig's tenure as Bond; Skyfall is the first film in which the character is given a first name, Eve. She is played by Naomie Harris, the only non-White actress to portray Moneypenny. Even though she is not considered a Bond girl, she is the first Moneypenny to have romantic moments with 007.
Eve was an MI6 field agent, who during a mission with Bond in Istanbul, Turkey, spots Bond while he struggled with mercenary Patrice atop a train. M demands that Patrice be eliminated, but due to the constant movement of Bond and Patrice, Eve lacks confident she can get a good shot at Patrice. M, frustrated with such a response, bluntly orders Eve to ""take the bloody shot"". Eve does so, and ends up shooting Bond, resulting in his apparent death.
Afterwards she is placed under investigation. Although not reprimanded due to the extreme situation and M's direct order to shoot, she is suspended from field work. But, when Q refused to meet up with Bond at his hotel in Macau due to his fear of flying, Eve went instead, where she helps shave his stubble, and prevents him from unbuttoning her blouse. Later, she and Bond head to a Macau casino where Bond cashed in a chip he lifted from Patrice, containing a suitcase full of money and meets Sévérine before he drops his earpiece into Eve's champagne glass as he passed by. Eve then helped Bond incapacitate the last of one of Sévérine's bodyguards with the case, which he tells her to ""put it all on red"" before leaving to meet up with Sévérine.
Not long after Bond took Raoul Silva into custody, Eve accompanied M to an inquiry hearing, which is interrupted by a recently escaped Silva, who tries to kill M, but with the combined efforts of Bond, Gareth Mallory and herself, M was able to escape with Bond's help.
A couple of days later, after M's funeral, Eve approaches Bond, who was admiring a sunrise and states she is unfit for field work, and will now work as Mallory's executive secretary, following the former's promotion to M. Before they leave, Eve gives Bond a box containing M's Bulldog Ornament as read in her will, believing it is her way to get Bond to take a desk job. As Bond says that they have not been properly introduced, she says her full name is Eve Moneypenny.
Monneypenny helps Bond in Spectre, while he's going rogue. She tells him that The Pale King is in fact Mr. White. Later she helps Bond in London when M finds out that C is spying on all the MI6 agents. In the final act of the film she helps Bond together with the MI6-crew to capture C and Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
Following Logan Ash's killing Felix Leiter, Bond goes to M, demanding to be allowed to meet Blofeld in prison. When M refuses, Bond goes behind his back, asking Moneypenny for help instead. She takes Bond to see Q, getting his help in decrypting a flash drive that Bond seized from the villainous scientist Valdo Obruchev. With this, the group uncovers the true, horrifying scope of Project Heracles, that its nanobots can be reprogrammed to target entire races, resulting in genocide on a massive scale. They also help Bond to arrange his meeting with Blofeld.
Following Bond's death in staying behind to ensure the success of the missiles that take out Project Heracles, Moneypenny shares a drink with M, Q, Nomi and Tanner.

281,/wiki/Bangkok,"Bangkok is the capital of the Kingdom of Thailand, and is located in the region of Central Thailand. With over eight million inhabitants (2010), Bangkok is the biggest city in Thailand. It has been the Thai capital since the beginning of King Rama I.'s reign in 1782.
Bangkok makes its biggest appearance in The Man With the Golden Gun, although it has also been used as a filming location in Tomorrow Never Dies (standing in for Vietnam). The city re-appears in the video game Blood Stone, but the city layout, as well as buildings and structures are purely fictional.
Hai Fat, one of the most influential tycoons in Asia lives in a luxurious estate in Bangkok, surrounded by a large garden, with pools, sculptures and even a mausoleum. However, this is not a real place in Bangkok, as the estate scenes were filmed at the 'Dragon Garden' in Hong Kong.

James Bond and Mary Goodnight both stay at the Oriental Hotel, which is located on 48 Oriental Avenue in the Bang Rak district, directly on the bank of the Chao Phraya river. Opened in 1876 by Danish captains, the five-star hotel today is the flagship of the Mandarin Oriental group.

After being captured at Hai Fat's estate, Bond is taken to a fighting school, which is also owned by Hai Fat. The Headmaster orders his students to attack Bond, but he manages to escape to the nearby canals. The fighting school is portrayed by the Dvaravati House at the museum park 'Ancient Siam' (""Mueang Boran""). The park, opened in 1972, consists of many replicas of ancient buildings from all over Thailand. The park is shaped like Thailand's borders and is located near the city of Samut Prakan, which itself is located in the southeastern outskirts of Bangkok.

After escaping from the fight school, Bond escapes by boat after a small boat chase. The location of that chase are the canals, the khlongs in Bangkok. Before goods were transported mainly on the roads, the khlongs were more important for trading in Thailand.

During a kickboxing match, Bond meets Francisco Scaramanga, Nick Nack and Andrea Anders (who has been murdered shortly before) in this arena. The stadium was opened in 1945 (construction was delayed by World War Two), and is located on Rajadamnern Avenue in the Pom Prap Sattru Phai district.

Bond steals a red AMC Hornet from a car showroom, which was located on the ground floor of Chokchai Building. In reality, AMC cars never were sold officially in Thailand.

Several portions of Sukhumvit Road were used as filming locations for the car chase. This road is not only one of the biggest in Bangkok, but also a long highway within Thailand, going all the way from Bangkok to the Cambodian border.

During the car chase, Bond drives eastwards on Ratchadamnoen Klang Road, with the Democracy Monument (built in 1939) in the background. The building on the right edge of the picture above, as well as the large Mercedes-Benz dealership on the left edge (visible better a few moments later) are still in place. The monument is located in the Phra Nakhon district.

A small part of the car chase was filmed on Lan Luang Road in the Pom Prap Sattru Phai district. This street has also changed a lot over the years.

The car chase also passes the 'Giant Swing' in the Phra Nakhon district, which was built in 1784. Although the swing itself is barely visible in this movie, the roadways surrounding it (Bamrung Muang Road) are used by both Bond and Scaramanga. The building in the background is Wat Suthat temple.

The cars of Bond and Scaramanga nearly crash into each other on the intersection between Maha Chai Road and Siri Phong Road, just near the 'Giant Swing' in the Phra Nakhon district.

A professor of forensic medicine, Kaufman is hired by Media mogul Elliot Carver after he learns about the relationship between James Bond and Carver's wife Paris. After first murdering Paris, Kaufman waits for Bond in his hotel room; intending to kill Bond in such a manner as to make Paris's death appear a murder-suicide. Confronting Bond at gunpoint, he brags about his professionalism and how his services as an assassin are in demand all over the world. Of all the methods at his disposal, apparently his specialty is the celebrity overdose.
Fortunately for Bond, Kaufman's attempt to shoot the MI6 agent is suddenly interrupted by a phone call from his protégé, Richard Stamper. Stamper and his men are attempting to break into Bond's BMW 750iL to retrieve the GPS encoder he had stolen back from them earlier in the film. They are, however, having difficulty bypassing the car's security system. In desperation, Stamper asks Kaufman to make Bond disable the vehicle's security.
Providing Kaufman with his mobile phone - the car's remote control device - 007 tricks him into activating the phone's taser feature, shocking him and giving Bond the opportunity to gain the upper hand. His own weapon now pointing at him, the assassin protests that he is merely a professional doing his job, but Bond simply replies that he is too and pulls the trigger and shoots Kaufman in the head killing him.
The novelisation has Bond reflecting that Kaufman's death is one of the rare occasions where he has killed someone whom he knew unquestionably deserved to die.

The Mulsanne Turbo was launched at the Geneva Motor Show in 1982 and produced until 1985. The Mulsanne shared the traditional 6.75 L (6750 cc/411 in³) Rolls-Royce V8 with aluminium alloy cylinder heads. All Mulsannes use a 3-speed automatic transmission. There was a 50% increase in power thanks to the Garrett AiResearch turbocharger. There was the usual highly polished walnut veneered fascia, blemish-free leather and carpets and headlining of pure wool for the interior. 498 short wheelbase and 18 long wheelbase Mulsanne Turbos were built

Dr. Friend was severely burned by the fire and survived by taking what remained of the, ironically perfected, SilverFin serum. He was flown to safety by Hellebore's pilot; first to Iceland, then to Norway, and finally down to Switzerland where he underwent months of painful treatment. While he was there he met a Nazi spy named Vladimir Wrangel, who sought out the doctor due to his experience working with the Russians, Germans and British. Perseus went to the very top of the Nazi intelligence apparat, and together they formed a plan to stage a fascist coup in the United Kingdom - replacing King George V with his more sympathetic son, Edward. Code-named ""Operation Snow-Blind"", the scheme would be conducted using a compromised Communist cell in Lisbon - dispatching zealous revolutionaries Roan and Sean Cullinan to carry out the deed during the monarch's visit to Eton College's Fourth of June celebrations. To confirm Edward's suitability, it was decided that Friend (""Obsidian"") would need to get close to the prince by replacing Graf von Schlick, a distant relative.

Blessing was born to at least one Lowele tribe parent in Zanzarim.
At some point she attended Harvard and began working for the CIA.
She was soon assigned to spy on the British Zanzarim Station as the Station Chief's secretary with orders to accompany James Bond to the Democratic Republic of Dahum in order to offer asylum to brigadier Solomon Adeka.
After duping station chief Ed Ogilvy-Grant into thinking he would arrive a week later, Blessing posed as Efua Ogilvy-Grant and briefed Agent James Bond, 007. After a brief conversation, they left for dinner at El Kebab, the only real restaurant in town. Afterwards they headed for a crowded bar to discuss Bond's entry into Dahum. She had arranged to drive most of the way, and had contacted a fisherman to take him the rest of the way by boat. They were then interrupted by a drunk man who mistook Blessing for a prostitute. Bond took him out back and knocked him out: a deed which Blessing felt was unnecessary, but she was grateful for.
The next day, Blessing set to painting the word ""Press"" on a beige Austin 1100 for their journey, and they commenced south, switching drivers every now and then. Unfortunately, they were eventually stopped at a military roadblock, and despite Blessing's best efforts to negotiate a way through, they turned around to not be kept waiting behind the other cars. On the second day they reached the town where they were to part ways, and Blessing met with the fisherman Kojo, who would take Bond into Dahum. That night however, Blessing noticed a Gecko on her ceiling, and having a phobia of lizards, she asked Bond to remove it. He did, and their tender moment turned into a night of lovemaking.
Unfortunately, they were kidnapped by Dahumian soldiers that had mistaken Bond for an English mercenary. Blessing was interrogated in a small tent in the jungle by their leader Jakobus Breed before she and Bond escaped from the rebels when they were attacked by the Zanza Force while trying to cross a road back into Dahum territory. James tried to keep Blessing hidden in the firefight, but Blessing was too afraid and claimed that she would not die in the jungle and ran away.
She managed to hide and survive the fight before wandering the jungle for days and stumbling on a convent where she was nursed to health before setting out for Port Dunbar where she found that Adeka had died. In order to get close to Hulbert Linck, she partnered with a mercenary called Kobus Breed, and on the day Zanza Force reached the city, she had to shoot Bond to prove her loyalty, but did not give a killing blow.
They escaped to Washington DC, where they worked for the charity AfricaKIN until she saw Bond in a restaraunt and alerted the CIA.
Rhe two met up in her hotel room and made love after discussing their mission and Blessing's allegiance. Unfortunately, they were seen by Breed, who would soon break in, slit Blessing's throat, and hang her up in the gotel bathroom with a giant fishhook through her jaw.

When the submarine encounters something strange underwater while cruising at a depth of 500ft, the vessel surfaces, only to see the bow of Karl Stromberg's submarine-hunting Liparus supertanker opening to swallow the Ranger. Talbot, along with his crew, remains prisoners on-board the Liparus until James Bond liberates them. Talbot later leads a raid on the ship's armory and provides weapons for the newly liberated British, American and Soviet sailors. During the battle for control of the ship Talbot is killed by an enemy grenade.

Carter first appears when James Bond and Anya Amasova are transported by helicopter to the USS Wayne in the ocean to continue research on Liparus. When the two battleships are on the surface on the high seas, the huge tanker ""swallows"" the submarine as he had done before with the British HMS Ranger.

"
295,/wiki/Drax_Enterprise_Corporation,"Drax Industries or Drax Enterprise Corporation is a company founded and owned by the billionaire industrialist Hugo Drax. Although primarily an aerospace company, the Drax Group also owns a number of subsidiaries worldwide, producing and transporting individual equipment components. It appears in the 1979 James Bond film, Moonraker, and was later re-imagined for the 2012 video game, 007 Legends.
Drax Industries first appears in the 1979 film Moonraker, in which the villain, Hugo Drax, uses the company to further his scheme of wiping out the majority of humanity and replacing it with a new master race of 'perfect' human specimens. As an aerospace firm, the company is known for manufacturing the Moonraker space shuttles for NASA.
Arriving in California, James Bond is given a brief aerial tour of the Drax Industries facilities by pilot Corinne Dufour. She shows him the main complex - a large-scale industrial area contained on the Drax Estate - where all the main production facilities for assembling the Moonraker shuttles (workshops, hangars, design and experimental blocks) are located. Aside from manufacturing the Moonraker shuttles the complex also houses research laboratories. Initially, the laboratories were secretly being used to develop a deadly nerve toxin. But by the time of the film's events production has been moved to another location - the Venini Glass factory in Venice.
Later in the film, Bond follows confidential weapons blueprints to Venini Glass, a Venetian glass manufacturer originally founded by Bruno Venini and subsequently acquired by Drax Industries. Ostensibly a legitimate business, the glass-works' founder is notable for having crafted a glass-handled sword, the only one of its kind in the world, which was owned by General Menotti in the late 18th century. Its glass museum houses numerous examples of Venini's craftsmanship. However, following Drax's acquisition of the firm, their premises have secretly become the location where his doomsday weapon is assembled, with its glass components and the Black Orchid toxin produced on site.
The completed devices are then shipped via import-export firm Carlos and Wilmsberg Inc. to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. As with Venini Glass, Carlos and Wilmsberg are also a subsidiary of the Drax Group. Manuela, an operative of Station VH, notes that they are very big importers in Rio and have have a warehouse on Carioca Avenue.
Bond investigates the warehouse only to find it empty. Drax has moved the weapons via his haulage company, Drax Air Freight, to a secret launch facility located somewhere in the upper basin of the Amazon River. Operating from São Pedro airport, Drax Air Freight runs a fleet of Lockheed L-188 Electra aircraft.
Hugo Drax's leadership places a strong emphasis on eugenics, as the billionaire uses Drax Industries to further his scheme of wiping out the bulk of humanity and replacing it with a new master race. Many of the company's employees physically reflect this principle.

After killing diamond smuggler Peter Franks, Bond swaps identities with the man and uses his corpse to smuggle African diamonds into the United States. At Los Angeles International Airport, James Bond meets Felix (posing as a customs official) and is taken by mafia hoods to a funeral parlour (the next link in the pipeline) where the body is cremated and the diamonds extracted. After passing the diamonds on, 007 is the victim of an assassination attempt, and only survives due to Leiter's prior swapping of the real diamonds with fakes. Bond telephones Leiter and informs him to bring the real merchandise quickly.

298,/wiki/Henry_Gupta_(Ricky_Jay),"Henry Gupta was a fictional American ""techno-terrorist"" in the employ of media baron Elliot Carver. A supporting antagonist portrayed by the late American stage magician, actor, and writer, Ricky Jay, the character first appeared in the 1997 James Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies, and was subsequently adapted in Raymond Benson's accompanying novelization as well in 1999 video game adaptation of the film.
Intent on starting a war between the United Kingdom and China, Elliot Carver sends Henry Gupta to a terrorist arms bazaar to purchase an American military GPS encoder. Using this device, Gupta meacons the GPS signal and sends the British frigate HMS Devonshire off-course into Chinese-held waters in the South China Sea, where Carver's stealth ship sinks the frigate with a sea drill and steals one of its missiles. Afterwards, his men shoot down a Chinese J-7 fighter jet sent to investigate the British presence, and kill the Devonshire's survivors with Chinese weaponry. After the Devonshire is sunk, Gupta is informed by Stamper that Phase 1 is complete.
When looking through the sound files of Carver's satellite launch event, Gupta hears Bond talking to Paris. When he shows Carver the footage, Carver decides to have his wife killed by Dr. Kaufman.
While infiltrating Carver's agency at Hamburg, Bond sneaks into Gupta's bureau and opens his safe, finding the GPS encoder inside and returning it back to the American military. He and his partner Wai Lin soon learn that Gupta has programmed the stolen missile to be launched into Beijing which will start off World War III and that Carver is planning to exploit the event to obtain China's broadcasting rights by having General Chang to take over as the new leader of China.
Sneaking aboard the ship with Lin after informing their governments about the plot, Bond takes Gupta hostage in front of Carver and his men. After a brief discussion with Bond about his plans, Carver asks Gupta if the missile is ready to fire. When Gupta says it is, Carver remarks, ""Then it seems you've outlived your contract"", and shoots Gupta, killing him. The terrorist's body is later vaporised when the Stealth Ship explodes.
In one of the deleted scenes of the film, Gupta throws some playing cards at a wall and they stick to it, which shows Gupta can partly fight. In another deleted scene when Bond was shooting up the place, Gupta tries to throw a card at Bond, but misses and hits a henchman instead.

299,/wiki/From_a_View_to_a_Kill,"For Your Eyes Only is a collection of James Bond short stories written by Ian Fleming, first published in 1960. The title story of the collection lent its name to the twelfth James Bond film, which was released in 1981 and was the fifth film to star Roger Moore as the suave and sophisticated British Secret Service agent. The film, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and directed by John Glen, was an EON Productions / United Artists movie and adapted both ""For Your Eyes Only"" and ""Risico"" from this collection, as well as part of the novel Live and Let Die. Other stories from this collection also provided source material for later Bond films.
The title of the collection is derived from a piece of jargon often used in government circles with regards to classified information. An ""Eyes Only"" notification indicates either a) the information contained is for the knowledge of authorized readers only, b) information contained is not to be discussed with anyone, or c) all of the above.
For Your Eyes Only marked a change of pace for Ian Fleming, who previously had written only full-length novels featuring his character, James Bond. In the late 1950s CBS made an offer to Fleming to write 32 episodes over a two-year period for a television show based on the James Bond character. This deal came about after the success of the 1954 television episode adaptation of Casino Royale on the CBS television series Climax!. Fleming agreed to the deal and began to write three outlines for the series; however, CBS later dropped the idea. In 1959 Fleming gathered his outlines and novelized them for a collection he originally titled ""The Rough With The Smooth"". The title was changed for publication to For Your Eyes Only and was additionally published with the subtitle of ""Five Secret Occasions in the Life of James Bond"". In America the subtitle was changed to ""Five Secret Exploits of James Bond"". In later editions, the subtitle was dropped.
The book contains five short stories:
Out of the five short stories included in the book, two were added in addition to the outlines Fleming had previously written for the proposed television series. The first, ""The Hildebrand Rarity"", was first published in Playboy in 1960. The second story, ""Quantum of Solace"", was an experimental piece Fleming had previously written for Cosmopolitan magazine. The short story actually has no secret agent elements.
The remaining three stories were, as previously stated, written as television scripts. The story ""For Your Eyes Only"" was originally written as the third episode in the James Bond TV series, first titled: ""Man's Work"", later ""Rough Justice"" and ""Death Leaves an Echo"" before finally settling on ""For Your Eyes Only."" Along with ""Risico"" (originally spelled ""Risiko""), ""For Your Eyes Only"" was adapted closely for the 1981 film version of the same name. ""Quantum of Solace"" was chosen as the title for the 2008 Bond film, but otherwise the film had no connection to the story beyond some superficial similarity in that the lead female characters in both were in abusive relationships. ""From a View to a Kill"" provided the title (but little else other than the short story and part of the film both being set in France) for the 1985 film A View to a Kill. ""The Hildebrand Rarity"" provided the character of Milton Krest and the sea vessel name Wavekrest for the 1989 Bond film Licence to Kill.
According to Henry Chancellor's James Bond: The Man and His World, ""From A View to a Kill"" was initially intended to be the backstory for Hugo Drax, the villain of Moonraker. The similar story would have taken place during World War II and featured Drax as the motorcycle assassin who crashes his bike and is taken to an American field hospital. Later the hospital is bombed leaving Drax with amnesia and a disfigured face.
The stories within the collection have been republished in other formats. In 2008, the five stories, along with those in Octopussy and The Living Daylights, were compiled in the Penguin Classics release Quantum of Solace: The Complete James Bond Short Stories, released as a tie-in with the film. In 2011, Penguin Modern Classics paired ""From a View to a Kill"" with ""The Living Daylights"" (from Octopussy and The Living Daylights) in a small compilation titled The Living Daylights.
""From a View to a Kill"" sees Bond investigating the murder of a dispatch-rider en route from SHAPE (central command of NATO in Europe located in Versailles) to his base, Station F, in Saint-Germain, France. Since Bond was already in Paris, M sends Bond to assist in the investigation in any way he can. To unravel the mystery Bond disguises himself as a dispatch-rider and follows the same journey as the previous rider to Station F. As expected, the assassin attempts to kill Bond, however, Bond is ready and ends up killing the assassin.
Bond tracks down the site of the base and observes it. He takes note of the location and gives it to agent Mary Ann Russell. He then proceeds, alone, to blow it up in the early evening. He is attacked by several surviving villains and is rescued by Russell and her fellow staffers from Section F.
The title is taken from a version of the words to a traditional hunting song, ""D'ye ken John Peel?"": ""From a find to a check, from a check to a view, from a view to a kill in the morning"". The title, ""From A View to a Kill"", was later used for the 1985 Bond film A View to a Kill, starring Roger Moore. Originally, the film was to be titled the same as the short story, but was changed just prior to release. The title, plus the fact part of the film takes place in France, is where any similarity between short story and the film end.
After a vacation to London during which Rhoda's affair ended, Masters returns and decides to end their marriage, although they would continue to appear as a happy couple in public for the sake of his job. While the story may not be full of adventure as previous Fleming tales, the point of the story was to show that Bond's adventures pale in reality to real-life drama. As the story closes, Bond reflects on the story the Governor told and comes to the conclusion that his current mission is dull and unexciting in comparison. The story is also an eye-opener for Bond who, before hearing the tale, had passed judgment on Rhoda who was one of the guests at the party.
In ""Risico"" James Bond is sent by M to investigate a drug smuggling operation based out of Italy that is pumping narcotics into England. M instructs Bond to get in touch with a CIA informant, Kristatos, who in turn tells Bond that a man named Enrico Colombo is behind the racket. Bond gets close to Columbo’s mistress, Lisl Baum, by posing as a researching author. When Bond sets out to find more information on Colombo from her, he is captured by him and brought aboard Colombo's ship, the Colombina. While in captivity Colombo informs Bond that Kristatos is actually the one in charge of the drug smuggling operation and that he is being backed by the Russians. On the next day, the Colombina arrives at Santa Maria, where men are loading another shipment. Bond, Colombo, and the crew of the Colombina attack the warehouse and discover Kristatos inside. While trying to escape, Kristatos is shot by Bond.
""The Hildebrand Rarity"" also predated the publication of the collection, appearing first in the March 1960 issue of Playboy. In this adventure, Bond is on holiday in the Seychelles Islands with his friend, Fidele Barbey. Through Barbey, Bond meets an uncouth millionaire named Milton Krest who has offered the two the job of aiding him in the search for a rare fish named ""The Hildebrand Rarity"". After agreeing to help, the three as well as Mrs. Elizabeth Krest set off aboard the Wavekrest in search of the fish. During the journey Bond learns that Mr. Krest verbally and physically abuses everyone around him, specifically his wife whom he punishes with the use of a sting ray tail he dubs ""The Corrector"". After finding the Hildrebrand Rarity, the party returns to the Wavekrest and returns to port. Along the way Krest gets drunk and insults Bond and Barbey and also schedules an appointment for his wife with ""The Corrector"".
During the same night Bond hears Mr. Krest choking, after which Bond discovers Krest has been murdered and the rare fish was stuffed into his mouth. So as not to be entangled in an investigation for the murder of Krest, Bond throws him overboard and cleans up the scene of the crime. The following day after the Wavekrest has reached port no one knows what had happened to Mr. Krest and all presume he fell overboard. Bond investigates both Barbey and Mrs. Krest and finally comes to the conclusion that Mrs. Krest had murdered him in an act of revenge for the way in which Milton Krest had treated her, although she never admits to committing the crime and Bond never asks.
Four of the five short stories in For Your Eyes Only were adapted into James Bond comic strips which were published in the British newspaper the Daily Express and subsequently syndicated around the world:
The first three stories were adapted by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky and are largely considered a depature from what readers of the comic strips were used to, focusing more on character details and the plot of the story. More so than any other adaptation, ""Risico"", ""From a View to a Kill"", and ""For Your Eyes Only"" are considered to be the most faithful adaptations of Ian Fleming's original work. All three stories were reprinted in 2004 by Titan Books and are included in the Goldfinger collection.
The fourth adaptation, ""The Hildebrand Rarity"", did not appear until six years after the comic strip versions of the other stories. It was adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak. This adaptation was reprinted by Titan Books in the early 1990s and again in 2004 as part of the Octopussy collection.
The remaining story in the collection, ""Quantum of Solace"", is one of only three Ian Fleming James Bond stories that has never been adapted as a comic strip. The other two are ""The Property of a Lady"" and ""007 in New York.""

300,/wiki/Compressed_air_boots,"The compressed air boots were fictional footwear specifically designed for protecting the feet and ankles during outdoor walking activities such as hiking. On the heel of each boot was a cylinder of highly-compressed air capable of lifting its wearer off the ground. Created by Horace ""I.Q."" Boothroyd, the device was used by James Bond Jr to leap himself and Vicki Jones over a rolling felled tree. The item appeared in episode 56 (""Quantum Diamonds"") of the 1991-92 animated television series, James Bond Jr.

301,/wiki/HMS_Bedford,"HMS Bedford serves as the British flagship during a hostile standoff with the Chinese Navy in the South China Sea; prompted by the sinking of her sister ship, HMS Devonshire. The real orchestrator of the international crisis - media mogul, Elliot Carver - attempts to instigate conflict between the fleets by firing missiles at each of the flagships from his undetectable Stealth Ship. Thanks to the work of MI6 and the Chinese Intelligence Service, the Bedford receives an urgent message from the Admiralty ordering the fleet to search for the Stealth Ship, which is subsequently made visible to radar after James Bond breaches its hull with an improvised explosive device. With the radar contact too weak for a missile lock, the Bedford opens fire on the fleeing craft with its 4.5 inch naval gun. 007 completely destroys the vessel by sabotaging a stolen cruise missile on-board. The Bedford and its crew are subsequently seen searching for Bond among the wreckage.

303,/wiki/Alvarez,"Alvarez was a fictional love interest of Lupe Lamora, mistress to drug lord Franz Sanchez. The character appeared in the 1989 James Bond film Licence to Kill, portrayed by actor Gerardo Albarrán, and was fleshed out in John Gardner's accompanying novelisation.
Aware of his mistress' infidelity, Franz Sanchez pursues Lupe Lamora to Florida, strangling a guard and catching her with another man, Alvarez. As an ironic gesture, Sanchez orders his enforcer Dario to cut out his heart and give to Lupe, whilst he personally whips her with a manta ray tail for her betrayal. As is later noted by Milton Krest, Alvarez serves as a lesson for all Sanchez' associates who might consider fooling around with Lamora.

304,/wiki/BMW_520i,"The BMW 520i is a variant of the E34 generation (1988–1996) of BMW 5 Series vehicles. The BMW 5 Series is a mid-size / executive car manufactured by BMW since 1972. The 520i was only available to the European market and was featured in the John Gardner novel Win, Lose or Die.
The BMW E34 is a version of the BMW 5 Series automobile built from February 1988 to 1995 with the Touring model ending June 1996. It replaced the BMW E28 in 1988 and was replaced by the E39 in 1996.
During the course of Win, Lose or Die M prohibits Bond from taking his Bentley Mulsanne Turbo and recommends that he opt for a more subtle car from the company car pool; a BMW 520i in unobtrusive dark-blue.
BMW 5-series cars from the E34 generation have appeared in several Bond movies as well, although never with a particular role.
"
305,/wiki/BMW_E38,"The BMW 750iL is a member of the the E38 generation (1994–2001) by that time, the 7 series was in it's third generation. The 750iL was essentially a long-wheelbase 750i (the ""L"" is from the German word for long, ""lang""). In America, the model was sold as the 750iL; there was no E38 750i in the US lineup. The 750i (and iL) came with a 5.4 L V12 346 hp (258 kW; 351 PS) engine, as was used in the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph. Both variants had a five-speed automatic gearbox.
Features of the BMW 750iL included high-pressure headlight washers, auto-levelling xenon HID headlamps (The E38 was the first car in the world to feature Xenon headlights), power moonroof, a sound system with 14 speakers and four subwoofers as well as 6-disc CD changer and rain-sensing wipers. BMW was also the first European car manufacturer to offer an integrated satellite navigation screen which featured on the E38 7 Series. The E38 was also the first generation of 7 series to be available with the option of a diesel, was the first BMW to have televisions fitted , the first to have a five speed automatic gearbox and the first car ever to be fitted with curtain airbags.
Other features included an automatic climate control system with separate controls for the driver and passenger, a three-position memory system for the driver’s seat, safety-belt height, new steering wheel and outside mirrors. Front-seat side airbags and a Head Protection System (HPS) were also standard. The 750iL featured an all-leather interior with burl walnut trim. The continuous-motion Active Comfort Seat technology was introduced in 1998 to improve comfort and reduce fatigue for the driver and front passenger.
The BMW 750iL was Bond's provided vehicle for the 18th James Bond feature film Tomorrow Never Dies (1997). Used during sequences set in Germany, the car came equipped with a security system that sprayed tear gas and delivered electric shocks to intruders. The vehicle also came equipped with a fingerprint-protected safe hidden behind the passenger airbag compartment. The 750iL could be controlled remotely via Bond's Ericsson cell phone, which flipped open to reveal an LCD display and trackpad. Defense mechanisms included a roof-mounted rocket launcher, self-sealing and re-inflating tyres, a cable cutting device in the front bonnet emblem and a caltrop dispenser under the rear bumper.
During a chase sequence in the Atlantic Hotel parking garage, its windshield (despite able to withstand sledgehammer blows) and rear window are shot out by a combination of grenades and assault rifle gunfire from Elliot Carver's henchmen who were at the wheel of two Mercedes S Classes, an Opel Senator Mk2 and a Ford Scorpio Mk1. Bond eventually eludes the thugs and drives the 750iL off the roof of the garage via remote control. The car ironically ends up crashing into an Avis car rental store at street level. In a deleted scene, while leaving Bond made the excuse ""Left the keys in the car"" to the civilians.
Seventeen vehicles were used during filming of the German scenes. Four were adapted to be 'hidden driver' cars, in which a concealed driver would sit in the back using a small steering wheel. Video monitors were attached to cameras hidden in the wing mirrors and on top of the windscreen. Three more BMW's were used as backup for the hidden drivers. One car was equipped with the sliding glove compartment revealing a safe and only used for this one scene. Another, dubbed the 'cannon', was specially prepared to be propelled off the roof in the car chase's climax. It was stripped off as much weight as possible in order to be fired from a special rig. The remaining seven 'pristine' cars were used only for back-up and exterior shots, including one that was being kept in Hamburg for shooting there.

308,/wiki/Felix_Leiter_(David_Hedison),"Felix Leiter is a fictional character invented by Ian Fleming in the James Bond books, who also appears in the Bond movies. In the films, Leiter works for the CIA, and assists Bond in his various adventures. He was portrayed by the late David Hedison in the 1973 film Live and Let Die and the 1989 film Licence to Kill.
Felix is in New York investigating dictator Mr. Big, James Bond's new target. The pair travel to one of Big's fronts, the Fillet of Soul restaurant in Harlem, where Felix steps out for a moment, leaving Bond on his own. Meanwhile Bond was captured by Mr. Big leaving Leiter to return wondering where he was. A barkeep at the club said that he had left without him, leaving Leiter puzzled.
Leiter, later returns to assist Bond after a crisis in Louisiana, dealing with Sheriff J.W. Pepper clearing up Bond's encounter with the local police.
Later, he, Bond and Quarrel Jr. set off to destroy Big's crops and rescue Solitaire. He later bid Bond and Solitaire farewell on the train home as they were getting on.
Felix, now working for the DEA, and James Bond arrest a drug runner before parachuting into Leiter's wedding. On his honeymoon, fellow DEA agent Ed Killifer assisted in breaking Franz Sanchez out after accepting $2,000,000 from the drug dealer, Felix is kidnapped and maimed by Sanchez by being lowered into a shark tank while his wife Della was raped and murdered. After being maimed, they threw his body back into his house and left a note saying ""He disagreed with something that ate him"". 
James, who was heading home had heard Sanchez's escape from an airport employee and went over and found Della dead, Leiter's office ransacked of his files and a bloodied Leiter. 007 soon answered a call intended for Felix but soon informed him to call an ambulance. Bond, in the process was fired from MI6 and went rogue to take his revenge on Sanchez in this film for these actions. Near the end of the film after 007 killed Sanchez with Leiter's best man present, Leiter had almost recovered and while talking to James, he said he'll be out of the hospital and James recommend some fishing and Felix said M tried to get to Bond and said he is rehiring him into MI6.
Leiter mentions that he knew James was once married 'but it was a long time ago', despite never having met Tracy Bond.
To play the part of Leiter in 1973 David Hedison was chosen for the part. He was actually hired for the part before Roger Moore was cast. The two were already friends and Pfeiffer and Worrall consider that this friendship comes though, with ""genuine chemistry"" between the two on screen. Hedison played the role with an understated charm, although the script did not give Leiter much to do. Author Raymond Benson thought him miscast, but acknowledged that ""he's the best Leiter next to Rik Van Nutter.""
Hedison returned to play Leiter sixteen years later and after another actor, John Terry, had played the role. Hedison did not expect to return to the role, saying ""I was sure that Live and Let Die would be my first – and last"" and director John Glen was reluctant to cast the 61-year old actor, since the role even had a scene parachuting. He was dropped on the set of the shark tank by a crane operator, but was not seriously injured. After the film he offered to return in future stating ""It would be nice to play Felix [again] with one leg.""
Hedison was the only actor to play Leiter in more than one bond movie, until Jeffrey Wright appeared in  Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and No Time to Die He remains the only Leiter actor to star alongside two Bonds (Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton).

309,/wiki/Della_Churchill,"During the pre-title sequence of Licence to Kill, Felix is on his way to marry Della when he unexpectedly learns that drug lord, Franz Sanchez, is in Florida. With the help of his Best Man, James Bond, Leiter pursues Sanchez and they return victorious. They parachute into the church and the wedding commences. At the reception, the bride and groom present 007 with a gift - an engraved cigarette lighter. Following the festivities she unintentionally references Bond's earlier short-lived marriage to Tracy Bond, unsettling him, and unintentionally foreshadowing her own fate. Leiter lifts her across the threshold of their bedroom only to be ambushed by two of Sanchez' henchmen. Their leader, Dario, steps out from behind the door and cudgels Leiter with his pistol. After killing Della in a manner suggestive of rape, the unconscious Felix is taken to a warehouse. Asking where is his wife, Dario mockingly informs him ""We gave her a nice honeymoooooon..."" Sanchez then lowers him into a shark tank. A visibly shaken Bond later finds Della, dead, on her bed, and soon swears to wreak havoc on the men responsible for her death and Felix's maiming.
In the 2020 anthology comic book published by Dynamite Entertainment, Della is mentioned by Leiter as his late wife and briefly appears in flashbacks. In this timeline, she lived long enough to mother two daughters, Cedar and Kelsey. Leiter divulged to Bond that after her death, his relationship with his daughters deteriorated. Her cause of death, however, was not disclosed.

313,/wiki/Brad_Tirpitz,"While working for the CIA, Tirpitz was sent in for deep infiltration of the Neo-Nazi terrorist organization the National Socialist Action Army. When the KGB and NSAA leader Konrad von Glöda set up ""Operation: Icebreaker"" as a trap for James Bond, Tirpitz, under the alias of Hans Buchtman, senior NSAA officer and confidant of Von Glöda, pretended to kill the ""real"" Tirpitz by staging an accident over thin ice. Tirpitz continued to act as Buchtman playing the part of Tirpitz when the operation began.
Following Rivke Ingber's accident at a land mine explosion, the remaining three agents race sled towards Count von Glöda's lair within the Soviet Union. Along the way, Tirpitz is supposedly killed in a land mine explosion, but Koyla instructs Bond to keep voyaging on. When they arrive at the Ice Palace, Tirpitz miraculously appears, and was supposedly in collaboration with Glöda working under the name, Hans Buchtman. When Gloda desires information on whether London intelligence has a NSAA hostage in custody, Tirpitz assists in the water torturing procedure on Bond, which fails.
Following Mosolov and Glöda's death, Tirpitz arrives to the hospital where Bond had been shot by Glöda in a gun struggle revealing he had not been associated with Glöda at all. Tirptiz explains that the CIA instructed him to make contact with Aarne Tudeer, which he did in Helinski, Finland, after he was suspected of doing arms deal with the Russians. Using his alias name, Glöda gained his trust. Concerning Rivke's real identity, he explains that he did not warn him because he did not know, the CIA did not alert him on this, and Glöda did not disclose this with him and was told late about the ""hospital setup.""

The character appeared in the 2010 video-game, James Bond 007: Blood Stone, and was voiced by Timothy Watson.
Dr. Malcolm Tedworth was a lead scientist in a Midhurst Laboratories project to investigate smallpox and anthrax; developing antidotes for the British armed forces, for use in the event of a biological attack. In a bid to extract details of his research which might be weaponized, Tedworth was kidnapped from his yacht in the English Channel by mercenaries in the hire of Russian oligarch, Stefan Pomerov. He was brought to Istanbul, where he was held captive by Bernin in the Byzantine catacombs underneath the city, along with fellow bio-tech researchers 'Remy' and Dr. S. Justacomins, director of bio-engineering at the University of Stuttgart. He is initially presumed dead as a result of a sudden squall capsizing his yacht, however MI6 is tipped off to his presence in Turkey (believing him to be selling his research) and dispatches James Bond to investigate. 007 arrives too late to rescue Tedworth from electric-shock interrogation; under pressure he divulges the password to the encrypted USB drive containing his research and is shot dead by his interlocutors. Bond later uncovers footage of his torture in Pomerov's safe.
In the Nintendo DS version of Blood Stone, instead of whispering out the password to his torturers prior to his execution, Tedworth tearfully says out loud that it was his phone number, twice.

317,/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld_(classic_film_continuity),"Initially a partially unseen character portrayed by Anthony Dawson and Eric Pohlmann (Voice), Blofeld was subsequently played on screen by Donald Pleasence, Telly Savalas and Charles Gray. A final depiction of the character (unnamed for copyright reasons) appeared in the pre-title sequence of For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by John Hollis and voiced by Robert Rietty. Following years of litigation over the ownership of the character, Blofeld was later re-invented for the Daniel Craig continuity of James Bond films (2006-2021), portrayed by Christoph Waltz.
Arriving at an isolated part of the base, Blofeld activates the base's self destruct system before fleeing. Although Blofeld escaped, Bond managed to destroy the rocket remotely before it could capture more astronauts.
Now the subject of an international man-hunt by the British Secret Service titled Operation Bedlam, Blofeld establishes a clinical allergy-research institute atop Piz Gloria in the Swiss Alps. James Bond investigates the office of Swiss lawyer Gumbold, and learns that Blofeld is corresponding with London College of Arms' genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, attempting to claim the aristocratic title ""Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp"". He ventures to Switzerland posing as Bray to gather intelligence on Blofeld, who has went to the lengths of having his earlobes surgically removed to back-up his claims of nobility. There he learns that Blofeld secretly plans to contaminate and ultimately sterilize the world's food supply using biological warfare, carried by his brainwashed Angels of Death. Blofeld claimed he would not carry out his plan if all his past crimes were pardoned and he is recognised as the current Count de Bleauchamp. Bond tries to trick Blofeld into leaving Switzerland so that MI6 can arrest him without violating Swiss sovereignty. Blofeld refuses and Bond is eventually caught by henchwoman Irma Bunt. Blofeld reveals that he identified Bond after his attempt to lure him out of Switzerland, and tells his men to take the agent away. Bond eventually makes his escape by skiing down Piz Gloria while Blofeld and his men give chase.
Aided by his future wife, Tracy, the next morning their flight resumes. However, they are intercepted by Blofeld, who sets off an avalanche; resulting in Tracy's capture, while Bond is buried but manages to escape. M tells 007 that Blofeld's ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. Bond then enlists Marc-Ange Draco and his Unione Corse forces to attack Piz Gloria, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a bobsleigh, with Bond pursuing him. The chase ends when Blofeld becomes snared in a tree branch, ripping him out of the bobsled and apparently killing him. Subsequently, Bond and Tracy marry in Portugal and pull over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car. As they converse, Blofeld (wearing a neck brace) and Bunt commit a drive-by shooting of the couple's car - with Blofeld driving, and Bunt firing the gun. Bond survives, but Tracy is killed in the attack.
Following the pipeline trail, 007 breaks into Willard Whyte's penthouse apartment only to be unexpectedly confronted with two identical Blofelds (who uses an electronic device to sound like Whyte). Bond kills one of the Blofelds, but he turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, where he is picked up by Blofeld's assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd and taken out to Las Vegas Valley where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. Bond escapes and calls Blofeld posing as his right-hand man, Bert Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and rescues him, but in the meantime Blofeld retreats to his oil platform off the coast of Baja California. In the process of escaping he abducts Bond's smuggler ally, Tiffany Case. With the satellite now in orbit, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, then proposes an international auction. Bond travels to the oil platform and is captured in an attempt to sabotage the weapon. Shortly afterwards Felix Leiter and the CIA begin a helicopter attack on the rig. In the ensuing chaos Blofeld attempts to escape using a midget submarine, but Bond gains control of the submarine's launch crane and crashes the sub into the control room, causing both the satellite control and the base to be destroyed.
Blofeld evidently survived the attack and resurfaced years later (dialogue in Marvel's comic adaptation would suggest 10 years after their last encounter) with a plan to exact revenge on his old adversary, James Bond, for foiling his plans and causing the downfall of his criminal organisation. Now wheelchair-bound, bald and wearing a neck-brace, Blofeld rigs a ""Universal Exports""-emblazoned Bell 206 helicopter with remote control hardware and remotely electrocutes the pilot after he collects 007. Taking control of the aircraft over a London gasworks, Blofeld toys with Bond before attempting to crash the flying death-trap in a warehouse. However, 007 regains control of the aircraft and impales Blofeld's wheelchair on its landing gear, lifting the villain into the skies. After toying with his nemesis, Bond drops the pleading Blofeld down a tall industrial chimney stack, killing him from the impact, avenging Tracy's death.
Ernst Stavro Blofeld's personality, in its authoritarian and inhuman megalomania, fits perfectly in the line of such infamous historical names as Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler or Stalin. Despite his absolutely ruthless character, he possessed an exceptionally calm and calculating mind, always acting in a thoughtful manner and leaving nothing to chance.
Although Blofeld was more of a strategist and a master thinker in the background, he was not afraid to personally intervene in the battle if necessary. However, he was most courageous when surrounded by a sufficiently large armed bodyguard, otherwise he cultivated a rather defensive fighting style, whose main goal was his safe escape. He also was a self-concerned megalomaniac who only cared about results, profit, power, and world domination, no matter how many henchmen he needs to sacrifice or innocent lives need to be lost in the process.
Even with several other Bond villains with massive attempted body counts, Blofeld’s plots were easily among the worst and most destructive in the franchise, having threatened millions of innocent lives and planned widespread, irreparable destruction, all stemming from megalomania and other purely selfish reasons without the faintest notion of good intentions.
Although not present in the novel, Blofeld makes his first on-screen appearance in From Russia with Love, portrayed by Anthony Dawson and voiced by Eric Pohlmann. Both men remained uncredited, the end credits listed a question mark instead of an actor’s name. In this appearance his face is not seen and only his lower body is visible as he strokes his trademark white cat, discussing a plan to avenge the death of their member Doctor Julius No by setting a trap that will put Bond and Russian agent Tatiana Romanova in a position where it will appear that they killed each other while escaping to escalate tensions in the Cold War. After being absent from Goldfinger, Blofeld returned in Thunderball.
Right before Blofeld is killed, he begs to Bond to spare him, and cryptically bribes him with a delicatessen in stainless steel. This line had been added in by the producer of the film, Albert R. Broccoli, as a throwback to Mafia slang for a very cushy bribe used during the time and place he was growing up in (as at the time, having a delicatessen in stainless steel was considered luxurious especially if the owner was a street vendor).
The classic depiction of Blofeld has appeared in a number of James Bond video games as a playable multiplayer character. His first appearance was in the 2004 first-person shooter video game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, developed by EA LA and published by Electronic Arts. During its development official footage of character renders released by the publisher featured the terrorist leader 'Number One' holding his Persian Cat, with the likeness of Donald Pleasence. Likely due to legalities, in the final product the character's face is obscured, shot from behind and from the neck downwards. Number 1 was voiced by actor Gideon Emery using a similar intonation to Pleasence's portrayal of the character.

All three parachute from a Lockheed C-130 Hercules and while 002 is captured on landing, 004 starts scaling the mountain. A lurking assassin singles him out for execution, killing an SAS guard who inadvertently stumbles upon him. Taking hold of 004's climbing rope, the assassin slides a note down to the vulnerable agent, before pulling out a knife and severing the line, causing him to fall to his death on the rocks below.

321,/wiki/Cigar_Girl_(Maria_Grazia_Cucinotta),"Giulietta da Vinci (listed in the film credits as Cigar Girl) was a fictional assassin under the employ of the terrorist, Renard. She appeared in the 1999 James Bond film, The World Is Not Enough, and its accompanying novelization penned by Raymond Benson. The character was portrayed by Italian actress, Maria Grazia Cucinotta, and was doubled by stuntwoman Sarah Donohue.
Bond overpowers Lachaise's bodyguards and holds him at gunpoint. Just as Bond is about to get the name of an assassin, Lachaise is killed by a thrown knife in his neck by an escaping Giulietta. Bond and the Cigar Girl both escape from the building.

In a deleted scene of the film, we find that Giulietta is actually working for Renard, and she reveals that Bond on the case. Renard gives her the task of taking him out, and says that he trusts she won't let him down. She was also told to allow Bond to escape the original attack in Spain, so that the bomb would be delivered to MI6 headquarters. Bond returns to MI6 headquarters in London, England in order to return the money to Sir Robert King. However, the money was actually a fertilizer bomb which kills King and blows a hole in the wall of the building. Through a hole in the wall, 007 spots Giulietta, who is watching the building from a Sunseeker boat on the River Thames. The assassin is wearing a red leather body suit with a zipper down the front. She uses a machine gun to fire at Bond and then takes off down the Thames, with Bond pursuing in a prototype Q-boat.
An elaborate chase takes place along the Thames, and it ends at the Millennium Dome. Giulietta uses a grenade launcher as well. Just as two torpedoes are about to blow up her boat, she beaches her boat near the Millennium Dome, and jumps onto a hot air balloon basket. Bond follows closely by, and jumps to catch the mooring ropes to the balloon. Bond offers her protection from her real boss, but she refuses, asserting that Bond cannot protect her from ""him"". Giulietta then commits suicide by shooting the aircraft's gas tank, causing the balloon to explode in a huge fireball. Bond releases from the rope and falls onto the roof of the Millennium Dome, hurting his shoulder on the landing. This injury hampers him throughout the rest of the film. We later learn in the film that she was working for Renard or his full name, Victor Zokas. Giulietta was hired to keep an eye on Mr. Lachaise.
In the novel adaptation of The World Is Not Enough, then-current Bond novelist Raymond Benson gave the Cigar Girl a name: Giulietta da Vinci, and retained a scene between her and Renard in Bilbao that was cut from the theatrical release.

326,/wiki/For_Your_Eyes_Only_(novel),"For Your Eyes Only is a collection of James Bond short stories written by Ian Fleming, first published in 1960. The title story of the collection lent its name to the twelfth James Bond film, which was released in 1981 and was the fifth film to star Roger Moore as the suave and sophisticated British Secret Service agent. The film, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and directed by John Glen, was an EON Productions / United Artists movie and adapted both ""For Your Eyes Only"" and ""Risico"" from this collection, as well as part of the novel Live and Let Die. Other stories from this collection also provided source material for later Bond films.
The title of the collection is derived from a piece of jargon often used in government circles with regards to classified information. An ""Eyes Only"" notification indicates either a) the information contained is for the knowledge of authorized readers only, b) information contained is not to be discussed with anyone, or c) all of the above.
For Your Eyes Only marked a change of pace for Ian Fleming, who previously had written only full-length novels featuring his character, James Bond. In the late 1950s CBS made an offer to Fleming to write 32 episodes over a two-year period for a television show based on the James Bond character. This deal came about after the success of the 1954 television episode adaptation of Casino Royale on the CBS television series Climax!. Fleming agreed to the deal and began to write three outlines for the series; however, CBS later dropped the idea. In 1959 Fleming gathered his outlines and novelized them for a collection he originally titled ""The Rough With The Smooth"". The title was changed for publication to For Your Eyes Only and was additionally published with the subtitle of ""Five Secret Occasions in the Life of James Bond"". In America the subtitle was changed to ""Five Secret Exploits of James Bond"". In later editions, the subtitle was dropped.
The book contains five short stories:
Out of the five short stories included in the book, two were added in addition to the outlines Fleming had previously written for the proposed television series. The first, ""The Hildebrand Rarity"", was first published in Playboy in 1960. The second story, ""Quantum of Solace"", was an experimental piece Fleming had previously written for Cosmopolitan magazine. The short story actually has no secret agent elements.
The remaining three stories were, as previously stated, written as television scripts. The story ""For Your Eyes Only"" was originally written as the third episode in the James Bond TV series, first titled: ""Man's Work"", later ""Rough Justice"" and ""Death Leaves an Echo"" before finally settling on ""For Your Eyes Only."" Along with ""Risico"" (originally spelled ""Risiko""), ""For Your Eyes Only"" was adapted closely for the 1981 film version of the same name. ""Quantum of Solace"" was chosen as the title for the 2008 Bond film, but otherwise the film had no connection to the story beyond some superficial similarity in that the lead female characters in both were in abusive relationships. ""From a View to a Kill"" provided the title (but little else other than the short story and part of the film both being set in France) for the 1985 film A View to a Kill. ""The Hildebrand Rarity"" provided the character of Milton Krest and the sea vessel name Wavekrest for the 1989 Bond film Licence to Kill.
According to Henry Chancellor's James Bond: The Man and His World, ""From A View to a Kill"" was initially intended to be the backstory for Hugo Drax, the villain of Moonraker. The similar story would have taken place during World War II and featured Drax as the motorcycle assassin who crashes his bike and is taken to an American field hospital. Later the hospital is bombed leaving Drax with amnesia and a disfigured face.
The stories within the collection have been republished in other formats. In 2008, the five stories, along with those in Octopussy and The Living Daylights, were compiled in the Penguin Classics release Quantum of Solace: The Complete James Bond Short Stories, released as a tie-in with the film. In 2011, Penguin Modern Classics paired ""From a View to a Kill"" with ""The Living Daylights"" (from Octopussy and The Living Daylights) in a small compilation titled The Living Daylights.
""From a View to a Kill"" sees Bond investigating the murder of a dispatch-rider en route from SHAPE (central command of NATO in Europe located in Versailles) to his base, Station F, in Saint-Germain, France. Since Bond was already in Paris, M sends Bond to assist in the investigation in any way he can. To unravel the mystery Bond disguises himself as a dispatch-rider and follows the same journey as the previous rider to Station F. As expected, the assassin attempts to kill Bond, however, Bond is ready and ends up killing the assassin.
Bond tracks down the site of the base and observes it. He takes note of the location and gives it to agent Mary Ann Russell. He then proceeds, alone, to blow it up in the early evening. He is attacked by several surviving villains and is rescued by Russell and her fellow staffers from Section F.
The title is taken from a version of the words to a traditional hunting song, ""D'ye ken John Peel?"": ""From a find to a check, from a check to a view, from a view to a kill in the morning"". The title, ""From A View to a Kill"", was later used for the 1985 Bond film A View to a Kill, starring Roger Moore. Originally, the film was to be titled the same as the short story, but was changed just prior to release. The title, plus the fact part of the film takes place in France, is where any similarity between short story and the film end.
After a vacation to London during which Rhoda's affair ended, Masters returns and decides to end their marriage, although they would continue to appear as a happy couple in public for the sake of his job. While the story may not be full of adventure as previous Fleming tales, the point of the story was to show that Bond's adventures pale in reality to real-life drama. As the story closes, Bond reflects on the story the Governor told and comes to the conclusion that his current mission is dull and unexciting in comparison. The story is also an eye-opener for Bond who, before hearing the tale, had passed judgment on Rhoda who was one of the guests at the party.
In ""Risico"" James Bond is sent by M to investigate a drug smuggling operation based out of Italy that is pumping narcotics into England. M instructs Bond to get in touch with a CIA informant, Kristatos, who in turn tells Bond that a man named Enrico Colombo is behind the racket. Bond gets close to Columbo’s mistress, Lisl Baum, by posing as a researching author. When Bond sets out to find more information on Colombo from her, he is captured by him and brought aboard Colombo's ship, the Colombina. While in captivity Colombo informs Bond that Kristatos is actually the one in charge of the drug smuggling operation and that he is being backed by the Russians. On the next day, the Colombina arrives at Santa Maria, where men are loading another shipment. Bond, Colombo, and the crew of the Colombina attack the warehouse and discover Kristatos inside. While trying to escape, Kristatos is shot by Bond.
""The Hildebrand Rarity"" also predated the publication of the collection, appearing first in the March 1960 issue of Playboy. In this adventure, Bond is on holiday in the Seychelles Islands with his friend, Fidele Barbey. Through Barbey, Bond meets an uncouth millionaire named Milton Krest who has offered the two the job of aiding him in the search for a rare fish named ""The Hildebrand Rarity"". After agreeing to help, the three as well as Mrs. Elizabeth Krest set off aboard the Wavekrest in search of the fish. During the journey Bond learns that Mr. Krest verbally and physically abuses everyone around him, specifically his wife whom he punishes with the use of a sting ray tail he dubs ""The Corrector"". After finding the Hildrebrand Rarity, the party returns to the Wavekrest and returns to port. Along the way Krest gets drunk and insults Bond and Barbey and also schedules an appointment for his wife with ""The Corrector"".
During the same night Bond hears Mr. Krest choking, after which Bond discovers Krest has been murdered and the rare fish was stuffed into his mouth. So as not to be entangled in an investigation for the murder of Krest, Bond throws him overboard and cleans up the scene of the crime. The following day after the Wavekrest has reached port no one knows what had happened to Mr. Krest and all presume he fell overboard. Bond investigates both Barbey and Mrs. Krest and finally comes to the conclusion that Mrs. Krest had murdered him in an act of revenge for the way in which Milton Krest had treated her, although she never admits to committing the crime and Bond never asks.
Four of the five short stories in For Your Eyes Only were adapted into James Bond comic strips which were published in the British newspaper the Daily Express and subsequently syndicated around the world:
The first three stories were adapted by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky and are largely considered a depature from what readers of the comic strips were used to, focusing more on character details and the plot of the story. More so than any other adaptation, ""Risico"", ""From a View to a Kill"", and ""For Your Eyes Only"" are considered to be the most faithful adaptations of Ian Fleming's original work. All three stories were reprinted in 2004 by Titan Books and are included in the Goldfinger collection.
The fourth adaptation, ""The Hildebrand Rarity"", did not appear until six years after the comic strip versions of the other stories. It was adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak. This adaptation was reprinted by Titan Books in the early 1990s and again in 2004 as part of the Octopussy collection.
The remaining story in the collection, ""Quantum of Solace"", is one of only three Ian Fleming James Bond stories that has never been adapted as a comic strip. The other two are ""The Property of a Lady"" and ""007 in New York.""

328,/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld_(Christoph_Waltz),"Ernst Stavro Blofeld, born Franz Oberhauser, was the main antagonist of the the rebooted James Bond series, serving as the unseen overarching antagonist of the first three films Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall, the main antagonist of Spectre and the overarching antagonist of No Time to Die.
He was not surprised when 007 and White's daughter, Madeleine Swann, determined the location of his base of operations. Greeted with a formal reception, Blofeld took them on a tour of his data-collection facility. He attempted to psychologically intimidate the pair, demonstrating his organisation's vast reach, and sadistically taunted Bond with intimate knowledge his past failures. This included showing Swannn footage of Bond and her father, moments before Mr. White had shot himself, which Bond had furiously demanded that Blofeld turn off. Enraged and determined to prevent Swann from seeing her father's death, Bond charged at Blofeld, only to be knocked to the ground by one of Blofeld's henchmen. Concluding, Blofeld had Bond struck unconscious and strapped him to a neurosurgical chair.
Revealing his new identity, the mastermind declared his intention to intimately torture Bond by drilling into his skull, the seat of his soul; depriving him of the ability to recognize faces, and, ultimately, destroying his visual cortex, leaving him completely blind. He was saved by Swann, who hurled the spy's explosive wristwatch at Blofeld's control console, which violently detonated and threws him across the room. In the chaos, Bond escaped and shots a fuel line - causing the entire complex to be consumed in an enormous fireball. Somehow, Blofeld survived the conflagration, but was left severely scarred on the right side of his face and, ironically, blind in his right eye.
Bond returned to London to prevent ""Nine Eyes"", with Blofeld following him to exact his revenge. He separately abducted Swann and Bond, and took them both to the ruins of the old SIS Building, which was scheduled for demolition. 007 freed himself and confronted Blofeld inside. Separated by a pane of bullet-proof glass, the villain revealed that he had hidden Madeleine somewhere inside the building. It was set to explode in 3 minutes: giving Bond the sadistic choice of dying alongside her, or saving himself and living with the pain. 007 liberated Swann and they narrowly escaped the building.
Believing them to be dead, Blofeld departed by helicopter - unaware that they were pursuing him along the River Thames in a boat. One of Bond's gunshots started an engine fire; causing the aircraft to crash land on Westminster Bridge. The wounded Blofeld crawled from the wreckage and was confronted by 007. Held at gunpoint, he told the spy to kill him. But Bond refused, ejecting his magazine, clearing the chamber, and stating that he was out of bullets. As Bond departed with Madeleine, SIS chief, Gareth Mallory, detained the villain on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, under the Special Measures Act of 2001. With Denbigh dead and the ""Nine Eyes"" scheme foiled, Blofeld accepted his fate with resignation.
Now the sole remaining member of the organisation, Blofeld came under the scrutiny of SIS, who confiscated his prosthetic eye and permitted Bond to perform an interrogation. Meanwhile, Safin blackmailed Swann into smuggling Heracles into Belmarsh with the intent of infecting Blofeld with the lethal virus-like weapon. Unwilling to do the deed, she inadvertently infected Bond; who, after being goaded by Blofeld, strangled him in a fit of rage. He was consequently infected with Heracles and perished within seconds.
Blofeld was also intensely sadistic, describing himself to James Bond as ""the author of all [his] pain."" Throughout their confrontations, he would ruthlessly play a number of cruel and elaborate games with James' mind about his past and the people he had lost all his life - Vesper, M, his parents, etc., torturing Bond by drilling holes in his head and penetrating his brain, remaining calm and smiling when James screamed in pain, and condemning Mr. White to a very painful death by thallium poisoning. Blofeld had little self-preservation instinct, despite his vile character.

331,/wiki/Ballistic_missile,"A ballistic missile is a missile that follows a ballistic trajectory with the objective of delivering one or more warheads to a predetermined target. Long range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) are launched on a sub-orbital flight trajectory and spend most of their flight out of the atmosphere. Shorter range ballistic missiles stay within the Earth's atmosphere.
Fictional ballistic missiles of various kinds have appeared in the James Bond franchise, beginning with the eponymous Moonraker rocket of Ian Fleming's third James Bond novel, Moonraker. Continuation author Raymond Benson also included a nuclear ballistic missile in his 1998 novel The Facts of Death. Later, the Eon Productions' James Bond film series would depict ballistic missiles in their adaptations of Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). ICBMs have also featured in the James Bond video games James Bond 007 (1998), Agent Under Fire (2001), Nightfire (2002), Everything or Nothing (2004) and From Russia with Love (2005).
The Moonraker was a fictional rocket modelled on the Second World War German V-2 rocket and equipped with a Soviet-designed nuclear warhead. The weapon was featured in the third James Bond novel, Moonraker. The Moonraker was being constructed by Sir Hugo Drax, allegedly for the British government. In reality Drax planned to launch the rocket into the heart of London.
In 1986, twelve years prior to the events of The Facts of Death, Brigadier General Dimitris Georgiou, a Greek military officer and Number Five of a mathematic cult called The Decada, stole an American-made solid-fueled two-stage ballistic missile - the Pershing 1a, or MGM-31A - from a NATO base in France. Nearly thirty-five feet long with a three-and-a-half-foot diameter, it has a range of 100 to 460 miles, and is one of the most successful mobile nuclear missiles ever created. The Decada intended to start a major war between Greece and Turkey by launching the weapon from Greece into Istanbul; equipping it with a nuclear warhead procured through a Russian mafia contact, Number Four.
Dissatisfied with the direction of global politics following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian General Golgov was responsible for setting up an arms smuggling ring; amassing an army to crush the West in retaliation for Russian nuclear disarmament. James Bond follows the smuggling pipeline to Golgov's hidden base in central Russia. He finds that the General has captured ally Zhong Mae and tied her to one of his five nuclear ballistic missiles. Bond confronts Golgov, who attacks him in an armed mechanical suit. 007 defeats him, but the General triggers the launch sequence for the missiles with his dying breath. Avoiding the missile complex's automated defence systems, Bond subsequently disarms the weapons.
Having kidnapped eight world leaders from a G8 summit in the Mediterranean held aboard the British aircraft carrier, HMS Excalibur, industrialist Adrian Malprave holds them captive at her mountaintop facility in the Swiss Alps. There, the British and French Prime Ministers, along with the German Chancellor and American President, are held at gunpoint in four sealed ICBM missile silos. Each silo houses an old Soviet ballistic missile, its 'CCCP' insignia hastily painted over and replaced with the Malprave Industries logo. Although never fired, it can be inferred from Malprave's dialogue that they were used by her to destroy the facility.
During the events of Nightfire, the 2002 video-game sequel to Agent Under Fire, Brazilian-Russian entrepreneur, Rafael Drake owns and operates Phoenix International, an environmentalist agency supposedly dedicated to decommissioning and disassembling nuclear reactors and arsenals. However, it becomes clear that Drake is in fact secretly hoarding supposedly decommissioned nuclear weapons for his own future use. Surrounded by hi-tech security below the waves surrounding his idyllic Pacific island, several Cold War era intercontinental ballistic missiles lie submerged. 007 demolishes them using explosive charges.
In 2004's Everything or Nothing, Nikolai Diavolo plans to take over Russia and dominate the world by using Soviet-era intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Located in a hidden missile silo underneath the Kremlin in Moscow, Diavolo upgraded the long-since decommissioned missiles with nanotech warheads; capable of eating through all known metals bar platinum. Bond is able to infiltrate the facility, and deactivate the missiles; but Diavolo makes his way to the surface, where he reactivates one of the missiles using a telemetry tower and aims it at London. Although he falls to his demise in the fiery missile silo below, Bond is unable to stop Diavolo from triggering the launch sequence and is forced to shoot the missile out of the sky using a nearby anti-aircraft turret.
In the 2005 video game adaptation of From Russia with Love, the criminal organisation Octopus steals a nuclear weapon and threatens to destroy London, unless a ransom of £100,000,000 is paid. Twenty-four hours later, 007 is dropped into Octopus' secretive island launch-site by parachute and attempts to stop their plan by infiltrating their secret base and disarming the stolen nuclear missile. After disarming the warhead, Bond encounters Grant once again in the facility's control centre.

The equipment was subsequently altered by the criminal organisation, S.C.U.M., to scramble the brainwaves of world leaders; turning them into pliable zombies. The original equipment was destroyed by 007 and was later rebuilt by Hope, who planned on using it to take vengeance upon 007's nephew. The rebuilt machine was also subsequently destroyed. The equipment appeared in episode 15 (""Never Lose Hope"") of the 1991 spin-off animated television series, James Bond Jr.

334,/wiki/Helga_Brandt_(Karin_Dor),"Miss Brandt is first encountered by James Bond (posing as Mr. Fisher, the new managing director of Empire Chemicals) during his scheduled meeting with Osato, wearing a bright orange blouse and white high heels. Arriving by helicopter, Osato introduces himself and his 'confidential secretary', who proceeds to offer Bond a glass of champagne. As she prepares drinks, Osato interviews Bond and covertly x-rays his chest, revealing his Walther PPK. He reprimands Bond's smoking habit, to which Brandt adds ""Mr. Osato believes in a healthy chest"", as she bends down to serve him. She proceeds to take notes during the interview. After 007 leaves, Osato turns to her and orders her to kill him; prompting her to pick up the nearby telephone and arrange for a car-load of assassins to intercept Bond outside. The attempt on his life fails.
Later, at the Kobe docks, Bond is captured while investigating the Ning-Po, a ship linked to Osato Chemicals, and is taken aboard to Helga's cabin, where she was waiting on a couch with her legs crossed, dressed in a much more seductive way. An expert in torture via surgical implements, Bond is spared a violent integration when she inappropriately decides to seduce and kiss him, aroused by Bond, and enjoying the fact of having him for herself only. 007 claims that he is an industrial spy and facetiously offers Helga $150,000 to help him escape back to Tokyo. She first refuses, stating that Osato would kill her, but after a brief hesitation she cuts his bonds and the pair has sex. Shortly afterward they board a Meyers 200 aeroplane supposedly bound for Tokyo. However, in mid-flight, while she is applying her makeup listening Bond offering her a protection from her bosses, Brandt, who in reality never wanted to betray them, traps him with a smoke bomb and a wooden restraint. She promptly parachutes to safety; leaving the spy to perish in the resulting plane crash. Unfortunately for Helga and unbeknownst to her, Bond escapes the death trap and makes an emergency landing.
During the filming, Karin Dor was nearly hit by a falling spotlight.

335,/wiki/Double_Jeopardy,"Double Jeapordy was a series of comic strips that ran in the Daily Express newspapers in 1971. It was reprinted along with other James Bond comics in the Golden Ghost paperback book.
After a Museum owner called for several valuable paintings to be shipped to a special gallery, the media became frenzied when it was revealed that the owner had been murdered earlier that morning. Elsewhere, a local aristocrat, Lady Winter was blackmailed with nude photographs of herself that she had never taken. The blackmailer offered to exchange the photographs for information that her husband, the Minister of Defense. Meanwhile, James Bond began to suspect SPECTRE being involved with the recent activities. Sir John Winter was soon narrowed down as the point of a great information leak, and his wife confessed to him shortly before he committed suicide in his study. Bond arrived the next day to ask her about her blackmailing. She told Bond everything before attempting to shoot herself. Bond ten put her description of the Blackmailer through the ""Ident-a-kit"" and it produced an image of the SPECTRE Agent Pujar. Bond and Bill Tanner then began to connect the crimes when James was sent to Morocco to investigate the Chinese Spy, Fritz Kumura. He was assigned to infiltrate an impenetrable villa, which he does by pretending to drown off the beach within the sight of Lalla Sadub, the only resident of the villa who is ever seen outside of it. He got no information from her, and had to take aerial pictures of the villa to confirm that Pujab, Kumura, Sadub, and a mysterious man named Tatianu, whom Bond was sent to locate, along with a man in bandages. MI6 lastetr contacted Bond and informed him of Tatianu's former profession as a plastic surgeon, causing Bond to suspect plastic surgery as the cause of the mysterious murders.

He escaped his room in the villa, and saw that the bandaged double was of a diplomat ready to create peace terms between the United States and Soviet Union. Pujar and Kumura then found out James' true identity, and tortured him with electroshock therapy. Sadub was able to save Bond from permanent damage, and they were able to warn the British Representative at the peace-talk, and the impostor was brought down.

336,/wiki/From_Russia_with_Love_(novel),"From Russia, with Love, published in 1957, is the fifth James Bond novel written by Ian Fleming. From Russia, with Love is frequently considered the best James Bond novel by many fans and critics (although even critical opinion varies greatly). The novel is credited with launching the James Bond craze, and leading to the official EON Productions film series. Its biggest boost came four years after From Russia, with Love was published from an article in Life magazine on 17 March 1961 in which U.S. President John F. Kennedy included it in a list of his favorite books; the James Bond novel was the only work of fiction in the list of ten.
The title of the book is occasionally printed with a comma, as From Russia, with Love, depending upon the publisher. It is more commonly printed without the punctuation. In 1979, Oxford University Press published a simplified adaptation of the novel, written by Rosemary Border, under its Alpha Thrillers imprint; this version was intended for people learning to read.
In Istanbul, Bond meets Darko Kerim, the leader of the British substation in Istanbul. Bond likes this man on sight. The two men spend a great deal of time together over the next few days because Kerim believes Bond should not sit in one place and wait for Tatiana to approach him. During this time, Bond not only sees more of Istanbul than he ever wanted, but he becomes involved in a plot against Kerim by a local gang who work for the Russians. This plot has nearly killed Kerim once with a bomb and they attack Bond and Kerim a second time while they are visiting a gypsy friend of Kerim's. Kerim decides he must take out their leader in order to stop these attacks. Bond goes with Kerim and watches as he executes this man in cold blood.
The next morning, Kerim is found murdered. Bond decides to stay on the train, however. A man boards the train and Bond thinks he is another MI6 agent. The man agrees to share the guard duties and stays with Bond and Tatiana in their stateroom. However, the man is Grant, the assassin, and the next morning he allows his identity to be known.A confrontation between Bond and Grant takes place on board, when Grant is shot by Bond.
Later, after successfully delivering Tatiana to the West, Bond has a final encounter with Rosa Klebb in Paris which leaves her dead and Bond poisoned.

337,/wiki/Admiral_Billings,"Admiral Billings was the fictional head of Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, also commonly known as MI6). Billings served also as the head of Warfield Academy's board of directors. A re-imagining of the character, M, Billings appeared in episode 19 (""Hostile Takeover"") of the 1991 spin-off animated television series, James Bond Jr..
Admiral Billings is established as the head of the Secret Intelligence Service and is James Bond's superior. The criminal organization, S.C.U.M., concoct an elaborate scheme to abduct and replace Billings, by exploiting his role as head of Warfield Academy's board of directors. S.C.U.M. operative, Mask, poses as temporary Principal of the school; replacing its academic staff with disguised agents. The crusty Admiral arrives with an escort and is critical of the new ""principal"" and his teaching methods. Mask's attempt to replace Billings and infiltrate the Secret Service is foiled by the intervention of Warfield student, James Bond Jr., who disguises himself as one of the villain's henchmen. After securing the villain, Bond Jr. assumed the likeness of the Principal and tried to escort the SIS head to safety. With the assistance of his friends, the remaining infiltrators were detained.

338,/wiki/Blofeld%27s_doubles,"DVD commentary for the film explains that stuntman George Leech stood in for scenes showing the patient having mud applied to his face, with stuntman Bill Morgan standing in when the patient rises up out of the mud, drowns and when he is examined by Bond. Both actors were uncredited.
In the original novel, Bond witnesses a horse jockey being tortured by Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, when they pour a bucket of scalding hot mud onto the jockey, as he takes a mud bath. In the novel, there is no mud bath cloning process at all; it was worked into the script as a likely homage to the source text.
Albert J. Luxford, who worked on special effects for the film recalled how mashed potatoes were mixed with cocoa to create fake mud for the opening titles sequence. What the crew didn't expect was the fact that, under hot studio lights, the mashed potatoes began to ""cook"", creating a bad smell on set.

339,/wiki/Helmut_M._Springer,"Helmut Springer is the leader of the Purple Gang, a Mafia syndicate operating out of Detroit, Michigan.
At some point in his career, Springer made friends with Jed Midnight, the leader of the Shadow Syndicate in Miami, Florida. During his career, Springer's second-in-command was a man named Slappy Hapgood.
By 1957, Springer's daughter attended Vassar College, in Poughkeepsie, New York.
In June 1957, Springer travelled to New York City and collaborated with gangsters Billy ""The Grinner"" Ring, Jed Midnight, Jack Strap, Mr. Solo, and Pussy Galore. All of the gangsters had been selected by Auric Goldfinger, codenamed as ""Mr. Gold"", to rob Fort Knox in Kentucky. Although most of the gangsters agreed, Springer backed out of Goldfinger's plan, as he feared his proposal ""would not find favor"" with his gang in Detroit.
For this, Goldfinger ordered his Korean manservant Oddjob to murder Springer and Hapgood, who had joined him on his visit to New York. As Springer and Hapgood were exiting the building, Oddjob shoved both men down the stairs, breaking their necks; Helmut died instantly, while Hapgood survived but later succumbed to his injuries. Goldfinger later claimed that they died in an ""accident"".
Springer is described as a ""man of distinction"", having glazed pale blue opaque eyes resembling cold, glass marbles, and wearing an immaculate pin-striped suit, a piquéd weave C.F. Hathaway dress shirt, and Aqua Velva grooming products.

340,/wiki/00_Section,"The 00 Section of MI6 is considered the secret service's elite. A 00 (typically read ""Double O"" and denoted in Fleming's novels by the letters ""OO"" rather than the digits ""00"") is a field agent that holds a licence to kill in the field, at their discretion, to complete any mission. Standard mandatory retirement age is 45 though various writers including Ian Fleming, Sebastian Faulks and John Gardner have contradicted this as a matter of Poetic License and several actors who have portrayed Bond on film have been older than 45 at the time of playing the character. Although Fleming only mentioned five 00 agents, others have been added over the years across various franchise media.
The following list is of the known members of this elite order who have been referenced in officially licenced James Bond fiction: novels, films, video games, and comic strips (not including impostors).

341,/wiki/Grace_Jones,"Beverly Grace Jones (born 19 May 1948) is a Jamaican singer, actress and model who played the henchwoman May Day in the 1985 James Bond film A View to a Kill, Roger Moore's final appearance as Bond. The character May Day possesses superhuman strength, a trait that became more convincing with the casting of Jones, who has an impressive physique.
Jones started out as a model, garnering popularity from regular appearances at the STudio 54 nightclub in New York City. In the late 1970's, she evolved into an electronic music artist with an androgynous look. Her hit singles throughout the years include ""Pull Up to the Bumper"", ""I've Seen That Face Before (Libertango)"", ""Private Life"", ""Slave to the Rhythm"" and ""I'm Not Perfect (But I'm Perfect for You)"". She also covered Gary Numan's ""Me I Disconnect From You""
In Europe, Jones' music became extremely popular (she still tours there today), but her success as a music artist in the US. was short-lived. However, she had a good run as an actress in the US, starting with some appearances in low-budget films in the 1970s and early 1980s. She entered the mainstream by appearing in the 1984 fantasy-action film Conan the Destroyer alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger, and of course, the 1985 Bond movie A View to a Kill. In 1986, she played a vampire in Vamp, and both acted in and contributed a song to the 1992 film Boomerang with Eddie Murphy. In 2001, she appeared in Wolf Girl alongside Tim Curry.

A minor antagonist and Bond girl portrayed by Moroccan actress, Leila Shenna, she appeared in the pre-title sequence of the 1979 James Bond film, Moonraker.
As 007 returns from an African assignment aboard an Apollo Airways airliner, the air hostess and pilot conspire together with Jaws to kill him by crashing the plane. After kissing Bond, the hostess produces a pistol and holds the spy at gunpoint. The pilot emerges from the cockpit and takes the gun from her, handing her a parachute which she puts on. After the pilot shoots out the aircraft's controls, 007 kicks the weapon from his hand and the two brawl until the assassin ends up being knocked out of the plane - shortly followed by a parachute-less Bond. The hostess' fate is unknown.
"
343,/wiki/Aston_Martin_DB5,"The iconic Aston Martin DB5, released in 1963, is a luxury grand tourer made by British luxury sports cars manufacturer Aston Martin. It was a slight upgrade from the DB4 which preceded it.
The DB5 is most famous for being the third, but most recognized, James Bond car. The vehicle first appeared in EON Productions' 1964 film Goldfinger and went on to appear in Thunderball (1965), GoldenEye (1995), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), Casino Royale (2006), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015) and No Time To Die (2021). In addition, the vehicle has appeared in the video-games 007 Racing (2000), Agent Under Fire (2001), From Russia with Love (2005), Blood Stone (2010), James Bond: World of Espionage (2015) and the Best of Bond DLC for Forza Horizon 4 (2018).
The vehicle was used again in the following film, Thunderball (Reg: BMT 216A), where it was equipped with two rear-facing water cannons for Bond's escape from Bouvar's château. The effect was achieved using two fire hoses mounted under the vehicle, the hose pipes clearly visible in some shots.
After a thirty-year absence from the film series, the Aston Martin DB5 reappeared in 1995's GoldenEye. Sporting a new number-plate (Reg: BMT 214A), the car was fitted with a radio that doubled as a printer and communication device, and a champagne cooler concealed under the centre arm rest. During the film, Bond is accompanied to Monte Carlo by an MI6 psychiatric evaluator, and engages in a race against a Ferrari F355 GTS owned by assassin, Xenia Onatopp. Three different DB5s were used for filming. The BMT 214A also returned in Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), and was set to make a cameo at Castle Thane in The World Is Not Enough (1999). Although the scene was cut, the outline of the Aston Martin can still be seen in the closing scenes of the film; as M and her staff attempt to locate Bond with a thermal-imaging satellite.
The Aston Martin DB5 (Reg: BMT 216A) appears briefly in Eclipse Comics' 1989 graphic novel, Permission to Die, as Bond's personal automobile that he drives to work in London.
The DB5 made a prominent appearance in the premiere episode (""The Beginning"") of the 1991–92 spin-off animated television series, James Bond Jr., as well as its literary and comic adaptations. Borrowed by Bond's nephew, the vehicle is pursued by agents of the criminal organization, SCUM, who want to procure its electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generator. In reality, the vehicle is not equipped with one. This iteration of the car is equipped with a homing device and remote starter kit. Its most notable feature is its flight mode, whereby its doors fold into wings and a propeller emerges from the radiator grille. The car is destroyed after the SCUM plane it was being carried on crashes in the English countryside. It is implied that Bond Jr's sports car was constructed from the DB5's wreckage.
Playing up to its association with 007, the DB5 also made cameo appearances in media outside the James Bond franchise. It appeared in the 1981 comedy film The Cannonball Run, driven by Roger Moore's character. Two years later, in the TV-film The Return of the Man from UNCLE, George Lazenby, playing a Bond-like character referred to as ""JB"", also drove a gadget-laden DB5 (with the licence plate ""JB""). Another spy show with the homage to Casino Royale called Mission Impossible (1966) in Episode 6 “Odds on Evil” were Steven Hill drives a red Aston Martin DB5 complete with twin yellow flags. Consequently, Timothy Dalton remains the only official Bond actor who has never driven one on screen. However, scripts for his unmade third Bond film show a DB5 was planned to be used.
The most recent appearance of the vehicle was in the 2004 film, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers in which Geoffrey Rush, playing Peter Sellers, is shown driving one at the time of making Casino Royale, even though in real life that film did not feature the vehicle. The car further made a appearance in the popular sandbox game GTA 5 (Grand Theft Auto 5) under the name 'JB700'. It in a mission of the story mode had spikes and a ejecting chair, as well as visible guns on the hood. The car can be bought from Legendary Motor Sports in both the online and story modes. But to many people's dismay, the car does not have the many gadgets of story or the one featured in the movies. Although they all are visible. In a later update to Grand Theft Auto Online, another variant of the car, named JB700W, was added, with the capability to have functional machine guns and a choice between spike and oil slick mines installed, though the ejector seat remains nonfunctional.

The golden bullet which killed him was found lodged in the wall by the dancer, which she pocketed as a good luck charm. Consequently, the identity of the killer was never confirmed until James Bond investigated the venue several years later in pursuit of Scaramanga.

345,/wiki/Arthur_Calder-Marshall,"R. D. Mascott is the pseudonym of a writer who penned 003½: The Adventures of James Bond Junior; a 1967 James Bond spin-off novel carrying the Glidrose Productions copyright.
To this day it has never been confirmed who wrote 003½: The Adventures of James Bond Junior, although many authors have been named as possibilities such as Roald Dahl and Kingsley Amis. Amis is usually seen as completely bogus since a year later he released Colonel Sun under the pseudonym Robert Markham, however, unlike R. D. Mascott, Amis's authoring of Colonel Sun was never a secret. Amis's writing style is also not similar to Mascott. Roald Dahl on the other hand does share some similarities specifically with one book he wrote in 1975, Danny, the Champion of the World. Coincidentally, in 1967, Roald Dahl completed the screenplay for You Only Live Twice for EON Productions, the same year 003½: The Adventures of James Bond Junior was published. Although there is evidence to suggest Dahl may have written 003½, there is equally as much evidence to suggest he didn't.
One author that has recently been identified as a possibility is Arthur Calder-Marshall who wrote a number of similar books especially in style and his descriptions of characters and environments in his books The Magic of My Youth (1951) and The Scarlet Boy (1961). It has also been suggested that the initials R. D. are a play on the name Arthur, which is typically shortened to Artie. Other writers that have been named as possibilities but tend to be rejected, include Peter Fleming (Ian's brother) and Nichol Fleming (Peter Fleming's son and Ian's nephew).

347,/wiki/Clive_Woodslow,"A very purposeful and driven man, Woodslow speaks English, Japanese and Russian, with skills in firearms, hand-to-hand combat and card sharking. He is also noted for being humourless. The character offers a buff to damage dealt and provides a -20% stamina reduction during Villain fights using poker player disguises, +15 total defence using hidden blades, a 7% damage increase in conflict and Villain fights using carbon sidearms, and a +8 stamina bonus using dictator disguises.

348,/wiki/Atomic_Specialist,"The atomic specialist is a fictional unnamed atomic specialist working with the CIA and United States military. A minor ally, the character appeared in EON Productions' 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger and was portrayed by Canadian actor Robert MacLeod.
Very little is known about the atomic specialist. After the CIA is informed of Auric Goldfinger's plan to detonate a Chinese atomic device inside Fort Knox (supposedly rendering the gold useless for 58 years and increasing the value of Goldfinger's own gold), the atomic specialist accompanies CIA agent Felix Leiter to the Depository. As Pussy Galore's Flying Circus spray a harmless gas over Fort Knox (originally intended by Goldfinger to be Nerve gas), the military personnel of Fort Knox convincingly play dead until they are certain that they can prevent the criminals from escaping the base with the bomb. Believing the military forces to be neutralised, Goldfinger's private army breaks into Fort Knox and accesses the vault itself as he arrives in a helicopter with the atomic device. In the vault, Oddjob handcuffs James Bond to the device. As the US troops attack, Bond extricates himself from the handcuffs and manages to electrocute Oddjob. Bond forces the lock off the bomb, but is unable to disarm it. The atomic specialist, who accompanied Leiter into the vault, turns off the device with the clock stopped on ""0:07"".
The atomic specialist originally stopped the bomb at ""0:03"" seconds, hence Bond's ""three more ticks"" line. However, this was changed in the American release version to ""0:07"".

It was located in Vauxhall, a south-western part of central London, United Kingdom, on the bank of the River Thames beside Vauxhall Bridge and directly adjacent to the defunct headquarters of MI6, the SIS Building. The building was featured in the 2015 James Bond film Spectre (2015).

350,/wiki/BMW_R1200,"The BMW R1200C is a cruiser motorcycle manufactured by BMW Motorrad. From 1997 to 2004, BMW manufactured 40,218 units. BMW first released the R1200C with an advance promotional placement of the motorcycle in the 1997 James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies.
At the time of its introduction, the cruiser configuration represented more than half the US motorcycle market. The R1200C was BMW's attempt to tap into this market, and was a significant departure from their previous endeavors. The R1200C was designed by BMW head designer David Robb, featuring a cruiser riding posture. From its inception, the R1200C featured a passenger seat that could fold up to become a driver backrest with three different angles, adjustable while riding.
When BMW ended production of the R1200C lineup, Dr. Herbert Diess, then President BMW Motorrad, cited a prime reason for discontinuing the bike was the apparent unsuitability of the 1,170 cc (71 cu in), 61 hp (45 kW) engine to then current market tastes and the unavailability of a suitable engine for further development, but did not rule out BMW pursuing a reinterpretation of the cruiser idea at a later date. The final model of the R1200C to be produced was the commemorative Montauk model, of which 350 units were built.
Captured by Carver's henchman Stamper, whilst investigating the wreck of the Devonshire in the South China Sea, Bond and Wai Lin are taken to the CMGN tower in Saigon. Following a daring escape from the tower they manage to aquire a R1200C to make their escape. An intense action-packed chase through Saigon ensues which culminates in a spectacular stunt - jumping from one building to another over the whirling blades of a helicopter. This unique stunt was achieved by stuntman Jean-Pierre Goy.

Created for the 2004 James Bond spin-off video game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, the aircraft is notable for its use as Dr. No's personal aircraft and is used to ambush the player character during a botched assassination attempt in Hong Kong.
Utilised by Dr. Julius No's paramilitary forces during his feud with Auric Goldfinger, the unnamed aircraft is a large tiltrotor aircraft with retractable landing gear, a V-tail configuration, and one three-bladed proprotor and engine mounted on each wingtip. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90° for horizontal flight, converting the aircraft to a higher speed turboprop aircraft. Other orientations are possible, allowing the aircraft to hover over the battlefield. The aircraft is armed with a nose-mounted, forward-facing missile launcher.

The goons close in on Bond, who is repeatedly buffeted by attendees of the carnival, but are ultimately unsuccessful in recapturing him, as Bond is found by his girlfriend Tracy, who leads Bond to her car before driving away.
Realizing that Bond had escaped them, the thugs returned to their car, the driver having seen which direction Bond drove away in. The spy attempts to use a phone box in the next town over to contact London, only to nearly get killed by Bunt, who fires several rounds at him in a sneak attack. Sitting in the back of the car, Felsen tried to shoot at Tracy's car as it hurtled along the icy roads, but is unable to get a clear shot. The car then skidded off the road and into a pile of deep snow.
Arriving at Lauterbrunnen, Bond and Tracy discover an ongoing stock car race and crash through the barriers to lose their pursuers. As expected, Bunt and her men followed and carnage ensued, with the spectators thinking they were part of the race. Sitting in the front passenger seat of the car, Braun managed to get a few potshots at Tracy's car before his own car is flung upside down, causing it to combust. The vehicle's occupants were forced to abandon the burning car before it exploded. Felsen is last seen trying to help Bunt out of the vehicle before running away with the others.
Felsen final's fate is unknown. He is not among the victims in the final battle in Piz Gloria where most of Blofeld's soldiers lost their lives, but in all likelihood it is possible some of Blofeld's men from Piz Gloria may have been in Lauterbrunnen or the surrounding areas at the time. It's a possibility Felsen is one of these. He may have more likely escaped with Irma Bunt after the Mercedes-Benz W111 blew up at the stock car race where Bunt was slightly caught in the blast. Felsen may have looked after her as she was trying to recover from her injuries.

361,/wiki/Forever_and_a_Day,"Forever and a Day is the fortieth official James Bond novel and the second continuation novel to be written by English novelist and screenwriter Anthony Horowitz. Commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications, it was released on 31 May 2018. The novel is set during 1950, against the backdrop of the brutal underworld of the French Riviera, and serves as a prequel to Ian Fleming's 1953 book Casino Royale.
Some time later, Bond is officially promoted to ""007"". He then meets his new secretary Loelia Ponsonby and discovers his new office. While browsing files left to his attention on the murder of 007, the situation in Marseilles and Joanne Brochet, aka Sixtine (that the deceased 007 had said in his last report to be involved in the lack of activity of the Corsican underworld ), he finally receives a phone call: he is summoned to M's office for the first time. M then entrusts Bond with the mission to continue the investigation of 007 and to investigate his assassination. When he asks him what number he would like to have, Bond answers the one of the deceased ""007"".
Bond begins to go to Nice where he returns to the apartment of the old 007. By dint of search, he found in a hidden envelope and, while he is about to leave, he falls on a man who threatens him with a weapon. Bond manages to control him and digs in his pockets: he then discovers that the man's name is Reade Griffith and that he is a member of the CIA.
After introducing themselves, Bond and Griffith chat on the terrace of a bar. It turns out that he too is investigating the cessation of exports of heroin from the Corsican underworld. They then examine in detail the contents of the envelope: photos showing Sixtine in the company of Jean-Paul Scipio (one of the most powerful chiefs of the Corsican heroin market), an invoice of a company named Ferrix Chimiques and the telephone number of 'some Monique'.
Bond learns from Griffith that Sixtine has a habit of frequenting the Monte Carlo casino. He goes there alone and notices that he counts the blackjack cards: he then settles at his table to break his system. Bond joins Sixtine at the bar after she lost because of him. He commands them a vodka martini and adds that she would like his ""shaken, not stirred"" to the bartender.
Sixtine tells him that she knows he is an ""00"" agent. They ask each other questions, she wants to know why the director general of the casino seems to be so grateful. Bond explains that some time ago, a Soviet cruiser named Aleksandr Kolchak was moored in Monte Carlo. Bond was then ordered to find a way to intercept the ship's communications. It turns out that his captain, Nikolai Stolypin, was going to the casino night after night to play roulette. Ruined, Stolypin once threatened to destroy the casino with the arming of the ship, if it was not repaid, to avenge his loss of money at the game. Bond then reasoned and let go of the casino with money in exchange for the transmission frequencies of the ship. Bond asks her what she was doing with Jean-Paul Scipio and she tells him that he just wanted to know what she was doing in the area. Before leaving, Sixtine invites Bond to meet again the next day at a party organised by a friend of hers, the businessman Irwin Wolfe, in the villa of the latter: Shame Lady.
The next day Bond and Reade Griffith go to La Joliette in Marseille, where 007 was killed. It turns out that Ferrix Chemicals has an office building nearby. They meet the general manager of the company, Andria Mariani, with whom they already had an appointment. As they get out of the building, Bond makes a leap to the department that handles the bills. He discovers that the one he found in the 007 envelope was for 114 litres of acetic anhydride for a certain ""WE"" (Wolfe Europe). Bond is however spotted and soon to be knocked out.
When Bond regains consciousness, he is tied to a chair. Jean-Paul Scipio makes him understand (through his interpreter) that he knows who he is and that he was at the origin of the death of 007. He tells Bond that he intends to send him back to London, disfigured by the hydrochloric acid, in order to send a message to his bosses: they remain out of the way. Before leaving, Scipio orders one of his men to throw a container in Bond's face and it turns out that the liquid inside it is not hydrochloric acid. It seems that Scipio just wanted to send a warning to Bond.
In the evening, Bond goes to the villa Shame Lady which is towards Cap Ferrat. Sixtine introduces Irwin Wolfe to Bond; this one speaks to him in particular of his new cruise ship which will make his maiden voyage to the United States in four days: the Mirabelle . He invites Bond to visit him the next day. When a little later Bond offers a cigarette to Sixtine, she recommends instead smoking Morlands (Bond currently smoking Du Maurier).
The next day, Bond will visit an employee of Ferrix Chemicals whom he briefly met during his visit to their offices: Monique de Troyes. He asks her for information on the deceased 007 and she told him that the latter seemed interested in knowing what Wolfe Europe was buying from Ferrix Chimiques. She stole bills for him. As she leaves Bond, he sees a car crushing Monique deliberately.
Later in the day, Bond goes to Mirabelle, which is anchored in Nice. Wolfe makes him visit before leaving him alone with Sixtine. She decides to take Bond home to Antibes , where they sleep together. Sixtine then tells Bond the story of her life and was drafted to steal the formula of the new photographic film that Wolfe's company invented and which would be better than those of Technicolor. She also tells him that it was Irwin Wolfe that he informed her that he was an agent 00. She also offers Bond a cigarette case with ""FOREVER AND A DAY"" written on it. She explains that she planned to offer it to her deceased ""husband"" Danny in reference to an exchange at their ""wedding"": Danny telling him he wanted to be with her ""forever and she told him that it was not enough and that she wanted it ""forever and a day"".
Bond decides to pay a visit with Sixtine to the Wolfe Film Factory near Menton. On site he finds that the place is very well kept, which seems suspicious. Guards surprise them, but Sixtine companions kill them. Bond decides he has seen enough and they leave. A little later, Bond and Sixtine return to the factory and manage to infiltrate it using the van of the usual baker (that Sixitine was able to bribe). They discover that a section of the factory is actually used to produce heroin with ""industrial"" processes. Bond and Sixtine are spotted and flee aboard a Jeep but are stopped and captured.
Bond and Sixtine are taken to the Mirabelle who begins his maiden voyage. There, Wolfe, accompanied by Jean-Paul Scipio, explains his plan. His two sons were killed during the Normandy landings during a war he deemed unnecessary (Wolfe was strongly opposed to the United States getting involved in the Second World War, he thought it was an European problem and not their business). The Mirabelle carries more than 5,000 pounds of heroin and he hopes that the distribution of heroin on the streets of the United States will make the US government more concerned with solving its drug problems than waging war in foreign lands, as it is currently the case in Korea. Thus, he thinks, lifes will be saved because young Americans will not perish on the battlefield (and in a sense he will also get revenge against the American government for the loss of his sons).
Wolfe leaves Bond at the hands of Scipio; The latter tells Bond that he will make him addicted to heroin. Bond is escorted back to his cabin with Sixtine and injected with drugs. Sixtine hastens to make a sort of tourniquet and blows Bond to extract as much heroin as possible from her blood before the drug takes effect. After he has recovered enough, they attract the guards behind the door and neutralize them. While searching the boat, Bond finds fireworks planned for the arrival of the Mirabelle in New York , and creates a bomb with. When it explodes, the ship begins to sink and Scipio drowns. Pursued, Bond and Sixtine jump overboard. Sixtine, injured, dies shortly afterwards and Bond swims to the coast.
Back in London, M asks his agent to pay a visit to Irwin Wolfe who managed to get off the sinking ship on a lifeboat. Bond goes to Wolfe's property in Los Angeles , where he finds Wolfe dead and Reade Griffith there. Griffith tells Bond that he killed Wolfe and disguised it as a suicide on behalf of the CIA. Bond begins to confront Griffith because he thinks he's the one who has informed Scipio (and so Wolfe) of his identity and presence in the south of France. Bond also knows that the CIA supports organised crime in Corsica in exchange for his help to fight the communists in the port of Marseilles. Griffith does not deny and acknowledge the facts. He says that the deceased 007 thought that Wolfe was in cahoots with Sixtine and that he wanted to get information on this from Scipio. Griffith arranged an appointment but Scipio pulled out a weapon and killed 007 without Griffith having time to intervene. Bond decides to take out his weapon and kills Griffith by surprise, without having received the order. Before leaving, he makes up the whole thing to make it look like Wolfe and Griffith have killed each other. He has no regrets.
"
362,/wiki/Australian_Secret_Intelligence_Service,"The Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS)is the Australian government intelligence agency responsible for collecting foreign intelligence, undertaking counter-intelligence activities and cooperation with other intelligence agencies overseas. ASIS is equivalent to the United Kingdom's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) or the United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The agency appears in the 2002 Bond video-game Nightfire, represented by the character and ASIS agent, Alura McCall.
In 1992 two reports were prepared on ASIS by officers within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and Office of National Assessments for the Secretaries Committee on Intelligence and Security (SCIS) and the Security Committee of Cabinet (SCOC). The Richardson Report in June examined the roles and relationships of the collection agencies (ASIO, ASIS and DSD) in the post cold war era. The Hollway Report in December examined shortfalls in Australia's foreign intelligence collection. Both reports endorsed the structure and roles of the organisations and commended the performance of ASIS.
Three Royal Commissions have examined, among other things, ASIS and its operations: in 1974 and 1983 (the Hope Royal Commissions), and in 1994 (the Samuels and Codd Royal Commission).
In response to a Four Corners program aired on 21 February 1994, on 23 February 1994, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Gareth Evans announced a 'root and branch' review of ASIS. The Government appointed Justice Gordon Samuels and Mike Codd to inquire into the effectiveness and suitability of existing arrangements for control and accountability, organisation and management, protection of sources and methods, and resolution of grievances and complaints. The Royal Commission reported in March 1995.
However, Samuels and Codd did find that certain grievances of the former officers were well founded. They appeared to support the officers' concerns regarding the grievance procedures:
In addition to their recommendations, Samuels and Codd put forward draft legislation to provide a statutory basis for ASIS and to protect various information from disclosure. The Samuels and Codd Bill, like the bulk of the reports, was not made public.
On 30 November 1983, ASIS garnered unwanted negative attention when a training operation held at the Sheraton Hotel, now the Mercure (Spring Street), in Melbourne went wrong. The exercise was to be a mock surveillance and hostage rescue of foreign intelligence officers. It involved junior officers who had undergone three weeks prior training and who were given considerable leeway in planning and executing the operation.
On 21 February 1994 Four Corners ran a program which aired the key allegations. Two former ASIS officers made claims regarding cultural and operational tensions between ASIS and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). They claimed that embassy staff had maliciously or negligently compromised activities involving the running of foreign informants and agents and the defection of foreign agents to Australia. They claimed that their grievances were ignored and that they were 'deserted in the field' and made scapegoats by ASIS.
The officers and the reporter Ross Coulthart also made brief claims regarding operational activities and priorities. The officers personally claimed that ASIS advice had been ignored by DFAT. The reporter repeated claims regarding ASIS operations aimed at destabilising the Aquino Government in the Philippines. He also made claims regarding ASIS assistance to MI6 in the Falkland conflict, in Hong Kong and in Kuwait for the benefit of British interests (including commercial interests) and potentially to the detriment of Australian interests.
The bulk of the personal statements by the officers concerned their private grievances. They raised two issues of public interest regarding the effect of secrecy on the operation of grievance procedures and the extent to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was aware of or in control of ASIS operations. The reporter directly raised the issue of the appropriateness of ASIS operations particularly with respect to priority setting in overseas postings and operations, cooperation with foreign intelligence services, and the privacy of Australian persons and organisations. By implication, the program queried the extent to which ASIS is or should be accountable to the Minister, to Government and to Parliament.
Two days after the program aired, the Samuels and Codd Royal Commission was formed by Minister for Foreign Affairs Gareth Evans.
In 2005, The Bulletin ran an article based on allegations by serving ASIS officers that alluded to gross mismanagement of intelligence operations, staff assignments, and taskings, particularly with respect to the war on terrorism.
The unnamed officers pointed out various problems within the agency that were plaguing the organisation's ability to collect vital and timely intelligence, such as the pitting of ""...young mostly white university educated agents with limited language skills and little knowledge of Islam against poor, zealous extremists intent on becoming suicide bombers."", the ""inappropriate"" assignment of ""...young female IOs (Intelligence Officers) against Islamic targets..."", poor staff retention rates, and general lack of officers possessing meaningful field experience.

363,/wiki/Felix_Leiter_(John_Terry),"Felix Leiter is a fictional American CIA intelligence operative. Based on the literary character created by Ian Fleming, Leiter appears for the sixth time in the 1987 James Bond film, The Living Daylights, and was portrayed by American actor, John Terry. He was the sixth of seven men to play the iconic role of Leiter officially on screen.
Felix Leiter rescues James Bond from the Moroccan police in Tangiers after Bond's fake assassination of General Pushkin. He informs him of his findings of Brad Whitaker's dealings and their relation to General Koskov's plans. Later, after Bond escapes Afghanistan, he helps Bond navigate Whitaker's villa in Tangiers where he kills him and apprehends Koskov with help from General Pushkin.
Following Hedison's first outing in 1973 in Live and Let Die, the Leiter role did not appear again until the 1987 film The Living Daylights, by which time Bond was being played by Timothy Dalton; the role was taken up by John Terry.
Smith and Lavington consider that, although the scene between Bond and Leiter sees warmth in the relationship between them, ""it is too fleeting to have any impact"". Pfeiffer and Worrall agree on the briefness of Leiter's role in the film, although they consider that Terry has ""virtually no chemistry with Dalton"".

364,/wiki/Captain_Scott,"Captain Scott was the fictional Stealth Ship captain and a security agent employed by CMGN. A supporting antagonist portrayed by British actor, Mark Spalding, the character first appeared in the 1997 film, Tomorrow Never Dies, and was also seen in Raymond Benson's accompanying novelization.
Scott served as the captain of the stealth ship secretly operated by the Carver Media Group Network (CMGN), acting under direct orders from Elliot Carver and his right-hand man, Stamper. He was a direct participant in the plans of the former to provoke a war between the United Kingdom and China as reprisal for the latter nation's refusal to allow him broadcasting rights. To this end, Carver used his media influence to form an alliance with the rogue Chinese general Chang. Men under Carver's direction commandeered the stealth ship Chang had developed and ultimately, under Scott's observation, used it to sink the British frigate HMS Devonshire and shoot down a Chinese MiG fighter jet, with each nation blaming the other. Scott personally ordered the Chinese jet shot down.
Following the attack, he observed Stamper after he and Timblin mercilessly executed seventeen Devonshire survivors. Following this, the captain ordered his divers down to the wreck of the frigate to extract the missiles from its cargo hold while fellow Carver associate Henry Gupta used a stolen U.S. encoder device to erase the GPS signature of the British ship and incriminate the Chinese.
Days later, with both the British and Chinese having deployed their fleets to the contested waters near the purported site of the attack, Scott observed as the final phase of Carver's plan was launched. However, James Bond and Wai Lin, agents of the two potentially warring nations, infiltrated the stealth ship and killed a number of the captain's subordinates before ultimately disrupting the ship's stealth systems through sabotage and inciting the HMS Bedford to open fire. As he faced withering volleys from both British and Chinese fleets, Scott ordered most of the crew to evacuate; he remained at the bridge with a handful of technicians, attempting to save the doomed vessel. Bond, intent on stopping Carver's ambitions, appeared at the bridge; when Scott and one of his men went for their weapons, the British secret agent shot them both.

365,/wiki/Camille_Montes,"Camille Montes was the youngest daughter of Ernesto Montes, a Bolivian military officer employed by the Junta of Commanders of the Armed Forces (and apparently a ""very cruel man""), and an unidentified Russian prima ballerina. When she was a young girl, the opposition in Bolivia sent General Medrano to the family house; he shot Ernesto, raped Camille's mother and eldest sister before strangling them to death, and then smiles at Camille before leaving and setting the house on fire, which is the cause for the burnt scars on her back. This left Camille severely traumatised and pyrophobic, but also instilled in her a burning (pun not intended) hatred of and desire to kill Medrano. Once she was old enough, she joined the Bolivian Secret Service and spent a long time waiting for a chance at revenge. To that end, Camille has approached environmentalist and Quantum operative, Dominic Greene, and slept with him in order to be able to reach Medrano with whom Greene made a deal in overthrowing the Bolivian government in exchange for giving ownership of a seemingly barren piece of Bolivian land for its vast resources.
In August 2006, realizing that Camille only sleeps with him to approach Medrano and she is trying to kill him, Greene sent hitman Edmund Slate to murder her by pretending to be a geologist with whom she had planned a meeting at Port-au-Prince, Haiti. However, British Secret Service agent James Bond kills Slate in his hotel room with his own agenda and taks the assassin's briefcase. As the spy is walking on the street, Camille sees him and tells him to get in her car, mistaking him for the geologist. As the Bolivian operative drives 007 off, she finds a gun and a picture of herself at the bottom of the briefcase and pulls her gun on Bond, who quickly jumps out of the car commenting ""That wasn't very nice!"". Camille later goes to a nearby dockside to confront Greene for trying to get her killed but the villain turns her over to Medrano, requesting that he kills her once he is done with her to sweeten their new partnership. Fortunately, Bond pursues them and manages to save Camille and the pair make escape, killing many of Medrano's men in the process. An unconscious Camille is then dropped off at a hotel down the river before Bond continues his investigation of Greene.
A few days later, Camille is present at a party hosted by Greene, who celebrates the land in Bolivia and attempts to make other deals. In order to force the billionaire to tell him where Medrano is, Camille makes him lose investors and a furious Greene tries to push the spy through a balcony, but Bond intervenes again and leaves with Montes. The criminal operative sends his right-hand man Elvis after them but 007's colleague Strawberry Fields trips the henchman and sends him tumbling down a staircase, leaving Bond and Camille leave the party. Unfortunately, Greene has the corrupt Bolivian police chief murdering French agent René Mathis in order to frame Bond and have the spy arrested by the police. However, Bond and Camille manages to escape after killing two of Carlos' policemen and then borrow an antiquated transport plane. Their pilot towards Bolivia's Atacama Desert to learn more about Greene and Medrano's plans. Carlos so dispatches a militarized Aermacchi SF.260TP fighter-trainer to pursue the duo and kill them on sight. To that end, the unidentified pilot riddles Bond and Camille's plane with bullets, destroying one of the engines and causing it to produce heavy smoke. Despite the damage, Bond manages to improvise by using the smoke to block the pilot's vision, placing his aircraft in such a manner as to reduce the SF.260's airspeed; causing him to lose control and crash into a rock formation. Bond and Camille fall into a chasm but survive thanks to a parachute. While they are alone, Camille talks with Bond about his motives for her revenge against Medrano.
The pair later leads a raid at Perla de las Dunas where Greene and Medrano attempt to finalise their deal, killing all of Greene's thugs and Medrano's men. As Bond fights against Greene, Camille makes her way to Medrano' suite, where she frees the maid the general attempted to rape and lets her escape. However, Medrano attacks the vengeful agent, gloating of the time when he raped and killed her mother. The ruthless General then tries to rape Camille, but she fights back and grabs her gun, aiming at Medrano. Swearing that she will burn, the dictator foolishly charges at Camille in an attempt to kill her, but the latter forcibly shoots the General in the head, killing him and ending her quest for vengeance. However, as the burning hotel is falling apart, Camille starts to panic but manages to escape the building with Bond, leaving Medrano's corpse to be buried in the rubble. Bond later escorts her to a train station where she is last seen walking for an unknown future.
Barbara Broccoli has said that she intends for Camille to return for a future film. If this happens, Camille will become the second Bond girl, alongside Madeleine Swann, to make a return appearance since Eunice Gayson, as Sylvia Trench, appeared in Dr. No and From Russia with Love and Rubelvitch from The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy, albeit as a minor character.

366,/wiki/007_Racing,"007 Racing is a 2000 racing video game developed by Eutechnyx and published by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation. This game marks the seventh appearance of Pierce Brosnan's James Bond; though like Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is Not Enough, the game includes his likeness but not his voice.
In 007 Racing, the player takes on the role of James Bond behind the wheel of some of his most famous vehicles from the then-current 19 official films. Cars include the Aston Martin DB5, the Lotus Esprit, and the BMW Z3 as well as 7 other automobiles. Each car is equipped with all the usual gadgetry and weapons issued by Q.
After returning from a mission to rescue a Cherise Litte from a fortress in Eastern Europe with his Aston Martin DB5, Bond returns to MI6 Headquarters to learn from M that a shipment of arms bound for Halifax Canada had been intercepted in the Labradour Sea. The arms aboard were provided by the United States and the United Kingdom to be used as a collective resource pool for their weaker NATO allies. Everyone on board had been killed with military precision, and missiles, missile casings, a next generation GPS, and a Q Branch modified BMW 750iL.
Bond is tasked with finding the cargo. He is sent to New York City to rendez-vous with his CIA operative friend Jack Wade. After leaving the plane Bond is issued a rental car, but when he reaches the city, Hammond Litte calls the car's cell phone, and he informs Bond that the car has a speed-sensitive bomb in it. Bond then collects disruptor chips to stall the explosion before jettisoning it into Hudson River and allowing it to explode.
Bond continues on with finding EMP device that was stolen and destroying ten computers in distribution center from which a car transporter carrying the smuggling cars. He intercepts the transporter with his Aston Martin. Bond then goes to Mexico with his BMW Z3, to where he was pointed by questioning the transporter driver, the henchman Whisper. He is trying to track Zukovsky and once he manages, he finds out that behind everything is Dr Hammond Litte, Cherise's father, and that her rescue was just a decoy mission aiming to distract him from the freighter. Bond then engages in race with Xenia Onatopp and her Ferrari F355 after which he gets captured by crashing into a buildozer with full speed, damaged his Z3 and taken to Louisiana. He manages to escape and finds the stolen BMW, after which he pursues and destroys the boat driven by Jaws.
Back in New York, Bond downloads the files from four limousines with his BMW Z8 and discovers that Litte's real plan is to release a deadly virus that will kill millions. Bond then goes to the Baltic Sea with his Lotus Esprit and after infiltrating opponent's underwater base he destroys the plane transporting the virus.
Most of the gadgets and weapons in 007 Racing are inspired by the James Bond films, specifically Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me, and The Living Daylights.
007 Racing has a splitscreen multiplayer with two game mode choices, Challenge and Pass the Bomb. Challenge is a head-to-head car fight, with each player trying to destroy the others with rockets, machine guns, and various other weapons. Pass the Bomb is a hot potato type game, where one player starts with a bomb that is slowing ticking towards detonation. This player must bump into another player to pass the bomb to them. Whoever holds the bomb when time runs out explodes, and loses.
Multiplayer allows each player to pick their own car to race with, and certain weapons can be turned on and off. There are also multiple arena, including the Secret Volcano, the Airport, the Arctic, and more.

371,/wiki/Bond_girl,"
A Bond Girl is a character who portrays a significant supporting role or a love interest in a James Bond film, novel or video game. They typically have names that are double entendres, such as ""Pussy Galore"" or ""Plenty O'Toole.""
Bond girls might be victims rescued by Bond, fellow agents or allies, villainesses or members of an enemy organization. Other female characters such as Judi Dench's M, Rosa Klebb, Irma Bunt and Miss Moneypenny are not classified as Bond girls.
The role of a Bond girl is typically a high-profile part that can give a major boost to the career of unestablished actresses, although there have been a number of Bond girls that were well-established prior to gaining their role. For instance, Diana Rigg and Honor Blackman were both Bond girls after becoming major stars for their roles on the television series, The Avengers. Additionally, Halle Berry won an Academy Award in 2002, an award presented to her while in the midst of filming Die Another Day.
Ursula Andress is often considered the first Bond girl, playing Honey Ryder in the film Dr. No (1962). She was, however, preceded by Eunice Gayson who played the character Sylvia Trench. Trench is the only Bond girl to appear as the same character in more than one film, appearing again in From Russia with Love (1963). Initially, Trench was planned to be a regular girlfriend of Bond's in the series, but was subsequently dropped after the encore appearance.
It should be noted that Valerie Mathis was the first ever Bond girl on screen in the 1954 version of Casino Royale. She was played by Linda Christian.
To date, only two Bond girls has captured the heart of James Bond. Tracy di Vicenzo played by Diana Rigg, marries Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). At film's end, Tracy Bond is gunned down by 007's nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld. It was initially planned that her death would actually occur in Diamonds Are Forever (1971), but this idea was dropped during filming of On Her Majesty's Secret Service when current-Bond George Lazenby announced he would step down from the role. The other girl is Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale (2006) who was secretly working for Bond's enemies and shared the same fate.
Within the official series, Maud Adams is the only actress to portray a main character as two different Bond girls in two different films, starting as Andrea Anders in The Man with the Golden Gun in 1974 and again as the title character in Octopussy (1983). She additionally appears as an extra in a third Bond film, A View to a Kill in 1985. Two other girls, Martine Beswick (Thunderball) and Nadja Regin (Goldfinger) also appear in a second adventure, appearing first in From Russia with Love. Tsai Chin appeared in two Bond films as well You Only Live Twice (1967) as a Ling and later as Madam Wu in Casino Royale (2006).
In 1995 Famke Janssen, who portrayed Xenia Onatopp, was considered the only major female character (and villain) whom Bond does not bed. However in 2008, lead Bond Girl Camille Montes also shows a restraint to Bond's usually forward charms.
Becoming more frequent, traditional Bond girls that have romantic trysts with Bond, are later discovered to be villainesses starting with Sophie Marceau's Elektra King in The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Miranda Frost portrayed by Rosamund Pike in Die Another Day (2002).
In late 2014, it was announced that Monica Bellucci will play Lucia Sciarra in Spectre (2015). At age 50, Bellucci made record as the oldest Bond girl in the film series. Previously, Honor Blackman held record, playing Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, aged 39 in 1964. Both actresses play the unlikely role, of being a Bond girl older than James Bond.

In addition to those actresses mentioned above, the Bond films traditionally have groups of women in the background whose general purpose is nothing more than eye candy: they include the sunbathing Miami beauties and Pussy Galore's Flying Circus in Goldfinger, the Thai girls at the kung fu school in The Man With the Golden Gun, Tiger Tananka's bathing beauties in You Only Live Twice, and Sheik Hossein's harem in The Spy Who Loved Me. However, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, A View to a Kill, and The Living Daylights these women were also referred to in the media as full fledge Bond girls to provide added publicity for the film through eye-catching magazine and newspaper appearances.
In On Her Majesty's Secret Service, they include Blofeld's Angels of Death. In Moonraker (1979) this included members of Hugo Drax's ""master race"" and a group of women encountered by Bond in the jungles of Brazil, in For Your Eyes Only (1981) many women were seen frolicking around a villain's pool, while in Octopussy (1983) they served mainly as the title character's servants and guards. In A View to a Kill (1985) they adorned Max Zorin's outdoor reception and in The Living Daylights (1987) they served as decorations at the villain's swimming pool and later Bond overpasses a harem in Tangiers. Although the Bond films haven't stopped making use of feminine ""eye candy"" completely, such large ""Bond girl groups"" have not featured again since The Living Daylights.
Mary Goodnight was a supporting character in several Bond novels before graduating to full Bond girl in The Man with the Golden Gun. The short stories ""Quantum of Solace"", ""The Living Daylights"" and ""The Property of a Lady"" feature female characters in prominent roles, but none of these women interact with Bond in any sort of romantic fashion.

Boody was a student at Dartington Hall in Totnes, England. She was one of four students selected to travel to the United States for a tour of the Kostler Academy. Before she left, she and the other three students watched a film reel of several real torture scenarios, which James Bond Dan Sloaman attempted to return the reel to where Dan had found it, and when they return, Boody informed Bond that she had seen Hugo Grande slip something under his door.
The next day they boarded the Allworld zeppelin, and rode it to Hollywood, where she toured the academy with her colleagues guided by Martyn Kostler, who invited Boody to a party thrown by his father, Anton Kostler. Martyn attempted to force her into romantic actions, but she refused and he slipped her a tranquilizer, and she woke up with Bond nearby in the viewing theater of the old Allworld Studios, in the presence of Anton Kostler and two gangsters, who take her and Bond into the old filming warehouse at the studio, where they are set free in order for the gangsters and Martyn to hunt and kill them.
Boody and Bond were able to escape by climbing set pieces to the catwalk above, and Boody was shot in the ankle. The two were led to the warehouse office by Hugo Grande and an English spy, but they were defeated and Boody was taken hostage by the Kostlers aboard their private zeppelin which caught fire when a man on board sought to end Kostler's violence by igniting the Hydrogen gas inside it. Boody and James then rushed to Kostler's private chamber to find a way out, but were pursued by a severely burned Anton Kostler, who was speared by a tree limb that broke through zeppelin's canvas covering as it hit a forest on its way down.
During the rough landing, Bond was knocked out, and Boody had to drag him to safety. They were reunited with their teacher, and the two shared a kiss before Boody returned to Totnes, while James remained in California for his aunt to pick him up from Mexico.

376,/wiki/For_Your_Eyes_Only_(soundtrack),"RykodiscThe soundtrack to For Your Eyes Only was composed by Bill Conti, famous for scoring five out of the six Rocky movies, and as with The Spy Who Loved Me features a more disco-oriented sound.
The theme song, also titled ""For Your Eyes Only"", was written by Bill Conti (music) and Michael Leeson (lyrics), and performed by Sheena Easton. The song was later nominated for both an Academy Award and Golden Globe in 1982. Easton also made Bond film history as the first (and, to date, only) artist to perform the theme song on-screen during the opening title sequence. Madonna would later one-up Easton by not only singing the theme song, but also appearing in a cameo role during the film Die Another Day in 2002, though she remained off-screen during the credits. The popularity of ""For Your Eyes Only"" and Easton's film appearance is credited with establishing Easton as a star in North America; she would alter go on to star in popular police drama Miami Vice. Easton had already been popular in her native UK for at least a year prior to the film's release.
Originally, the band Blondie was approached to write and perform the theme song for the film. They produced a song also called ""For Your Eyes Only"" that they turned into the producers; however, this version was never used and Easton and Conti were subsequently asked to write the theme. Blondie eventually released their song on the 1982 album The Hunter.
Tracks 1-12 were first released in 1981. When the soundtrack was remastered on compact disc, seven previously unreleased tracks were added (13-19).

Plunging into the river below, Bond begins to flash back to several of his previous missions that took place in-between Quantum of Solace and Skyfall.
In Miami, Bond awakens in a hotel room to find Jill Masterson dead from skin suffocation, coated in gold paint. Days later in Switzerland, Bond infiltrates the facility of Auric Goldfinger, the man responsible for Masterson's death. He discovers Goldfinger's plan to irradiate the United States Gold Depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky in Operation Grand Slam. Bond manages to convince Goldfinger's personal pilot, Pussy Galore, to inform the CIA, and he and the Army manage to thwart Goldfinger's scheme in the nick of time.
In the Swiss Alps, Bond and his lover Contessa Teresa ""Tracy"" di Vicenzo, daughter of Italian Unione Corse boss Marc-Ange Draco, escape via skis from the soldiers of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, a terrorist mastermind residing in his mountaintop lair, Piz Gloria. Bond is injured by helicopter gunfire, and Tracy is in turn captured by Blofeld's men. Some time later, Bond and Draco lead an aerial attack on Piz Gloria in order to rescue Tracy. They succeed. However, on their honeymoon, Bond and Tracy are attacked by Blofield and the latter is killed.

378,/wiki/GoldenEye_(film),"GoldenEye is the seventeenth James Bond film and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as Ian Fleming's British secret service agent, James Bond. Made by Albert R. Broccoli's EON Productions (though listed as ""Albert R. Broccoli presents"") it was the second official James Bond film not produced by Broccoli (although oversaw the film as Consulting Producer) himself. While undergoing heart surgery, Broccoli entrusted the making of the film and the forthcoming generation of James Bond films to his daughter Barbara Broccoli and stepson Michael G. Wilson, both of whom had been executive producers of previous James Bond films. GoldenEye was released in 1995 and was directed by Martin Campbell. Campbell also directed 2006's Bond film Casino Royale.
GoldenEye is considered an important film in the Bond series in that it was successful in reviving interest in a character that many critics had suggested had become an anachronism in the post-Cold War world.
The previous film, Licence to Kill, had been released in June 1989, before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Although it was financially successful and critically acclaimed, it was not as popular as previous Bond films, suggesting interest in the series was waning at that point.
Judi Dench, the newly cast M, describes Bond as a ""sexist, misogynist dinosaur. A relic of the Cold War."" This unusual candour, combined with a generally well-received performance by Brosnan as the new James Bond, helped to revitalize the franchise replacing Robert Brown. The role of Miss Moneypenny was also recast with Samantha Bond replacing Caroline Bliss and Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor to reprise the role of Q.
The story starts in 1986, in the Soviet Union. British secret agent James Bond and his fellow 00 agent and friend, Alec Trevelyan (006), have infiltrated a secret Soviet chemical weapons production plant with the intention of blowing it up via bombs. After finding their target, a large room filled with canisters that contain chemicals, James begins to plant the charges while Alec holds off the facility's guards. Alec is then suddenly captured by a ruthless Soviet colonel, Ourumov, who then orders Bond to surrender by pointing a gun to Alec's head. Alec tells Bond to ""finish the job"", to which Bond resets the charge timers from six minutes to three and walks out to surrender. Ourumov counts ten seconds for Bond to comply, as Bond does so, Ourumov executes Alec with a shot to the head when Alec tries to call out to Bond. Bond retreats to his hiding spot just as Ourumov's men fire. Ourumov stops and warns them any further gunfire will kill them since the place is filled with gas tanks, just as he calls out to Bond again. Thinking fast, Bond quickly takes cover behind a cart of chemical canisters and moves towards a cargo conveyor belt that leads outside. A nervous guard is killed by Ourumov when he shoots at Bond from the tension. Activating the conveyor belt, Bond is able to escape on it and shoots out the locks holding hundreds of other canisters which collapse on Ourumov's men. Outside the facility, a plane is taking off and Bond attempts to hitch a ride to safety. Ourumov sends troops out, together with motorcycling scouts. Bond manages to chase after the plane, but in a wrestle for control of the plane pulls himself and the pilot out. Knocking the pilot in the path of a motorcycle scout resulting in both killed in the collision, Bond uses the motorcycle to chase after the unmanned plane, heading to the cliff edge. Ourumov halts his men realizing Bond seems to be after an apparent suicide. With the plane and him falling off the edge, Bond dives for the cockpit. He successfully regains control of the plane and flies off as the chemical compound explodes.
Nine years later, Bond is driving in the mountains near Monaco with a female psychiatrist from MI6 in his signature Aston Martin DB5. She is assigned to evaluate his mental state, but nervously notices he is driving very fast. Bond drives down a mountain road and becomes involved in a dangerous race with a beautiful woman in a Ferrari. The two drivers agree to a race, resulting in a bike entourage all falling down and a near collision with an oncoming tractor. After a while, the psychiatrist, citing Bond's reckless nature, demands that he halt the game. Bond does so by pulling the handbrake, then comforts her. He reveals there is some expensive wine in the car's storage, then kisses the psychiatrist.
Bond heads over to a casino, where he notices the girl in the car is there as well from the presence of her parked car. Seeing it is a stolen model Bond heads over to where she is. He plays and wins a game of Chemin de Fer against the girl. Finally losing after a winning streak, she gets outraged and storms off. Bond follows her and introduces himself, she likewise does the same revealing herself as Xenia Onatopp. Bond tries to warn her of driving a stolen car, but she tells him she knows a man in motoring business. She then proceeds to retire for the night with a Canadian Naval Admiral. After she leaves, Bond remotely observes her from afar, noting she and the Admiral are staying at a yacht where he photographs her and the yacht's launch-boat model. Bond learns, with the help of Miss Moneypenny on his car's radio transmitter that she belongs to crime syndicate ""Janus"" which operates out of St. Petersburg and M authorizes him to follow her. That night, Onatopp murders the admiral during sex by suffocating him by crushing his chest between her thighs. Just as she does so, a mysterious hand steals the admiral's identity card. The next morning, Bond proceeds to investigate the admiral's yacht, finding him dead in the closet. He then rushes to an aircraft carrier which is holding a military demonstration of the Eurocopter, a helicopter capable of withstanding electromagnetic shocks. It is being taken by Onatopp and a mysterious figure, who, moments before, killed both pilots and assumed their identities. Arriving too late, Bond is arrested when he tries to stop the theft and watches helplessly as Xenia and her co-pilot fly away.
In Siberia, at Severnaya, at a Russian satellite underground, Natalya Simonova does her usual rounds of programming just as her co-worker, Boris Grishenko reveals his hacking plans, self-proclaiming he is a genius. Natalya heads for some coffee as Boris heads outside for a cigarette. However, his smoke break is disrupted by the landing of the Eurocopter, housing General Ourumov and Onatopp as they land. Heading over to the facility for a surprise inspection, within the facility lies the new satellite weapons system called GoldenEye. Ourumov orders the commanding officer to hand over the activation keys and control disk for GoldenEye just as Onatopp opens fire on everyone working at the facility (as she kills, she shows signs of sexual excitement). Onatopp and Ourumov then activate the GoldenEye satellite, which contains a nuclear warhead capable of delivering an electromagnetic pulse (EMP). They decide to test the weapon, targeting Severnaya. Unknown however to Onatopp and Ourumov, Natalya wasn't in the room when the others were murdered. Natalya inadvertently blows her cover, signalling Onatopp to check. Just then, a barely alive technician activates an SOS alarm to which Onatopp shoots. Calculating that the military will be too late to respond, Ourumov suggests they leave at once. Onatopp heads for the pantry where Natalya was and finds the air conditioning grating loose. She fires at it but realizes nothing is there. Ourumov and Onatopp escape in the Eurocopter, just as Natalya crawls out of the cupboard under the counter where she hid from Onatopp in the pantry. Three Russian fighters are dispatched to the scene, called by the SOS. Natalya surveys the dead, before realizing the GoldenEye sets off it's EMP blast (noting the main screen's countdown). The facility has all its electronics exploding just as Natalya daftly runs for cover. The fighters are also affected by the blast, two are destroyed as their electronics fail and likewise self-destruct. The last one crashes directly into the facility's foundations, causing the radar dish above to collapse. Natalya is nearly killed from all the explosions but survives. She tries to escape from the facility but all the electronics are dead, trapping her. The weight of the radar dish, however, plunges down from above, giving Natalya a way out of the facility. She climbs out of the underground facility with the help of the girders and tries to find Boris whom she thought was outside.
At MI6 headquarters, in an observation room, Bond talks with Bill Tanner, a specialist, who tells him they found the missing Eurocopter at Severnaya by satellite imagery. M enters, just as Bill finishes briefing Bond. All three witness the total disruption of images and electronics in the region resulting from the GoldenEye EMP blast, but are shocked by the sudden blackout of imagery. As their systems are rebooted and Bill informing them it indeed was an EMP blast. On a screen, Bond spots a survivor crawling away. It is Natalya, and she manages to find a fallen dog-sledder whose ride is still intact. Realizing she is alive and could be a lead, Bond tells M that Natalya could know more. In M's office, Bond is further briefed about the GoldenEye, which leads to data on Ourumov who has been recently promoted to General. Following a brief and tense conversation where M senses Bond doesn't trust her judgement, she tells him he is a ""sexist, misogynist dinosaur"" and a ""relic of the Cold War"". She however orders him to go St. Petersburg to investigate the connections between the GoldenEye weapons system (possibly finding Natalya), Ourumov and a mysterious Russian crime syndicate Janus. She also warns him to complete his mission and not to focus on revenge on Ourumov for 006's murder. Bond drops by Q's lab and is given a wristwatch with a laser, a belt loaded with a cable that can support his weight and a ballpoint pen which doubles as a grenade when clicked three times. Bond is also shown his new car, a BMW Z3 which Q reminds Bond he is ""not to break the traffic law"" with it despite it being fully loaded with the essentials.
Ourumov meets with Russia's defence council, headed by Defense Minister Mishkin, in a hearing about Severnaya. Ourumov reports that he investigated the matter and deduces the attack being done by Siberian separatists, he then states his resignation which shocks the council. Mishkin however rebukes him and tells him of their actual findings of two survivors from the attack at Severnaya. Ourumov states he knows about only one survivor, Boris who was captured by him and Onatopp earlier, now labelled missing. However, he didn't realize that Natalya had survived the blast and Mishkin updates him on it. Ourumov states he will look into the matter himself, before leaving. Natalya makes it to St. Petersburg, knowing she is being wanted by the authorities. She makes her way to a computer station, borrowing its system to contact Boris whom she deduced is out there somewhere. Managing to get in contact with Boris, Natalya revealed all she knew about the attack. Boris, now working for Onatopp and Ourumov, upon knowing Natalya is alive summons her to a chapel via email to which she meets him there. When Natalya reaches, she is promptly captured by Boris and Onatopp.
Bond arrives at St. Petersburg airport and proceeds to meet his CIA contact, Jack Wade. Wade tells him that nobody knows about Janus except an old KGB agent Zukovsky who is one of Janus' business rivals. Wade agrees to take Bond to the hideout of Valentin Zukovsky, whom Bond had wounded and given a permanent limp years before (Bond had also stolen Zukovsky's woman). Given Zukovsky is the only known connection of meeting the leader of Janus, Bond is eager to meet him. Zukovsky is still quite bitter about his wounded leg though, nearly shooting Bond but agrees to aid Bond when offered a bribe and explosives. Zukovsky also gives Bond a bit of history about Janus' leader; who is the child of Lienz Cossack parents whose tribe had worked with the Nazis during The Second World War and were given refuge by the British government. However, they were betrayed by the British and remanded back to USSR where they were all executed under orders from Stalin. Bond wants Zukovsky to set him up with a meeting of Janus, to which Zukovsky agrees, now satisfied him and Bond are even.
At his hotel's pool and steam room, Bond meets Onatopp herself, who tries to kill Bond. The two start fighting, with the combat being sexually exciting to Onatopp. Bond refuses to be seduced or injured and after a struggle, trains his pistol on her and orders her to take him to Janus. Onatopp then drives Bond to a graveyard of old Russian political figures, stating he will find his target there. Bond knocks Onatopp unconscious and walks out to meet Janus. As Bond stands alone in the graveyard, a figure appears and greets him. Natural re-flexing, Bond points his gun towards the figure. The figure walks towards Bond, and comes out of the shadows, revealing to his amazement that he is his old friend Alec Trevelyan, alive and well, with his right side of the face scarred because of the explosives nine years earlier that Bond had set to three minutes instead of six. He took the name ""Janus"" as a reference to the two-faced Roman god. Trevelyan explains his origin to Bond how his parents escaped Stalin's execution of their people and fled to England but later killed themselves because of the shame. Closing their conversation, Bond attempts to shoot Alec but gets shot in the neck with a tranquillizer dart. Awakened by Natalya screaming in the backseat, Bond wakes up in the pilot's seat of the Eurocopter. It has been programmed to fire its rockets at itself, to which Bond tries to override by activating the Eurocopter's engines. Too late to stop the firing sequence, Bond is able to hit the emergency eject button at the last second with his head and the two are ejected away from the blast. Bond frees them both and they are almost immediately arrested by the Russian army and both are taken to a holding center in St. Petersburg.
While waiting to be questioned, Bond tells Natalya that he is aware of her role in Severnaya who she is, by pointing out that her watch is permanently stopped which is a sign of the EMP that destroyed Severnaya. Initially denying, she proceeds to tell him she knows little else besides Ourumov's theft of the GoldenEye control disk and that Boris is working with the general. Minister Mishkin then walks in the room and threatens Bond with execution for terrorism (for supposedly stealing the Eurocopter and GoldenEye). Bond rebukes every statement Mishkin makes, claiming that an act of treason is involved. Natalya quiets them both and tells Mishkin that Ourumov stole GoldenEye, letting him know that there is a second satellite with the same nuclear weapon.
Ourumov suddenly bursts into the room and protests that Mishkin is interfering with his investigation. Mishkin quiets down Ourumov but Ourumov seizes Bond's Walther PPK and kills a guard and Mishkin, intending to then shoot Bond and make it look like he ""tried to escape"", returning Bond's pistol in the process. Bond is able to knock Ourumov unconscious, then a few guards and he and Simonova escape into the archives. After Natalya is captured by Ourumov, Bond manages to escape the building. Seeing Ourumov escape with Natalya in a car, Bond steals a Russian tank and chases after them, destroying most of St. Petersburg. He finally tracks them to a train yard where Ourumov and Natalya board a large, black Russian missile train that serves as Alec's HQ. Further down the tracks, Bond plans to derail the train by driving the tank into the train. Just as it nears the tank, Bond opens fire but the train still cruises towards the tank despite the brakes being activated. With the train crashing into a halt and destroying the tank, Bond then continues to confront Alec in the train, holding him and Onatopp at gunpoint. Alec calls Ourumov into the room with Natalya whom he holds hostage. Causing a minor Ourumov to question Alec's orders by telling Ourumov of Alec's Cossack heritage, Bond is able to shoot Ourumov but Alec escapes with Onatopp. Alec locks the train remotely, trapping Bond and Natalya inside, and tells Bond that he's planted explosives on the train with timers set for the same six minutes Bond gave him years before (which means he's actually set them for three minutes) before escaping in a helicopter. Bond cuts through the floor with a laser planted in his watch while Natalya, on a computer console, finds Boris backing up his files. With aid from Bond on Boris' riddle password, Natalya manages to track Boris' location somewhere in Havana, Cuba. Realizing he has been detected, Boris frantically removes the hard drives from the system, cutting off the transmission. The two escape the train before it explodes. After sitting on the tracks and planning their next move Bond and Natalya share a moment together kissing.
Bond and Natalya travel to the Bahamas to meet Jack Wade, who flies in a plane, giving Bond a gadget from Q (a remote detonation mine). Wade and Bond exchange their information, and Wade agrees to exchange his plane for Bond's car. Bond and Natalya spend a romantic night together, but Natalya is angered on the fact of Bond's cold nature. Bond answers by saying that he must kill his old friend in order to stop him. She later asks if she meant anything in his eyes, to which he playfully says she was not. The next morning the two fly over the approximate location where Natalya had traced Boris' computer signal; a seemingly idyllic lake. A missile is fired from under the water which cripples their plane and they crash in the jungle. At the crash site, Bond carries Natalya out into a clearing before knocking out himself. Soon he is awakened to a chopper flying overhead, where Onatopp rappels down from and attacks Bond. She starts to squeeze Bond with her legs, intending to kill him for good but Bond is able to re-hook her restrains back to the chopper. Grabbing her gun and shooting the chopper down, it pulls her into a tree and killing her. Bond and Natalya soon discover that the lake really hides a giant satellite dish. In an underground control center, Alec and Boris have activated the second satellite's EMP to have it target London. Alec's plan is one of revenge against England's betrayal due to his parents and the EMP will destroy every computer system causing nation-wide chaos. The blast will also erase all electronic records, but not before Alec has had Boris break into the Bank of London and steal all of its cash reserves.
Bond and Natalya find a way inside, which triggers the facility's intruder alarm. Bond and Natalya split up; Bond will make a distraction while Natalya goes to reprogram the satellite. Natalya finds a computer terminal, hoping to block Boris's programming of the GoldenEye satellite. A brief gunfight ensues between Bond and the guards, but Bond places his mines on the fuel tanks just before he surrenders. The fuel tanks leak their contents, and the facility soon subtly floods with fuel. Bond is captured first, as is Natalya but not before she encrypts her programming, and both are brought to Alec, who quickly and easily disarms the bombs Bond planted by pressing on his watch. Reuniting with Natalya, Boris is tackled by her and is knocked into a corner where he inadvertently picks up Bond's grenade pen instead of his own. Noticing the pen is clicked multiple times, Bond focuses his attention on Boris' pen clicks. After the satellite shows Natalya's doing which she sets it to re-enter orbit into the Atlantic, Boris then discovers that Natalya has changed his access codes for the satellite and Alec threatens to kill Bond if Natalya doesn't undo her work. Nervously clicking the pen, Boris frantically tries to reprogram the system. Boris activates the C4 mechanism of three clicks on the pen just as he angrily demands the codes from Natalya. Bond knocks the grenade into the nearby pool of leaking fuel where it explodes, combined with the mines Bond planted despite disarmed, causing a fire that threatens to blow the entire facility. Alec orders Boris to take back control of the satellite or be shot. Alec runs off to kill Bond and follows him to the satellite dish's large antenna. As Bond and Natalya finalize to finish things off, he gives her his pistol. On the antenna, Bond and Alec start fighting. After both James and Alec run out of ammo from their rifles, they resort to their fists. Bond manages to injure Alec and throws him down to the lower levels of the antenna. Before heading down, Bond notices and blocks the gearing mechanism with a pipe, which prevents Boris from regaining control of the satellite in orbit. As per what Natalya programmed, the GoldenEye safely explodes in the atmosphere.
Dalton's second Bond outing, ""Licence to Kill"" (1989) is met poorly at the box office, especially in the USA with a lack-lustre marketing campaign up against some stiff competition. Pre-production work for the third James Bond film starring Dalton, fulfilling his three-film contract, began in May 1990. A poster for the then-upcoming movie was even featured on the Carlton Hotel during the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. In August, The Sunday Times reported that producer Albert R. Broccoli had parted company with writer Richard Maibaum, who had worked on the scripts of all but three Bond films so far, and director John Glen, responsible for the previous five instalments of the series. Broccoli listed among the possible directors John Landis, Ted Kotcheff, and John Byrum
Several plot details on the original drafts have been revealed about Bond 17's plot before the subsequent re-writes that would culminate with GoldenEye. After terrorists target a Scottish nuclear facility, James Bond is deployed to the Far East to investigate the prolific businessman Sir Henry Lee Ching. In Hong Kong, Bond rendezvous with retiring spy Denholm Crisp who was a mentor to Bond early in his career. He crosses paths with the Chinese Secret Service and teams up with jewel-smuggler Connie Webb to get to the bottom of Ching's shady past and prevent global pandemonium that could spark World War Three.
The MGM/Pathe global television rights are challenged in the courts causing further delays. In May 1993, Variety reports that Michael France has been hired to pen the new Bond adventure, Richard Smith is also brought on to plot ""future"" Bond stories. MGM/UA legal debates draw to a close and in 1993 a more ""Bond-friendly"" view is taken by the execs. By August 1993, France turned in a second draft. In April 1994, with still no sign of Bond 17 going to production, Dalton bows out from the role. Many of France's ideas prove too similar to Schwarzenegger's spy-picture, ""True Lies"", new screenwriters are sourced to polish the James Bond outing. On 12 April 1994, Timothy Dalton announced he was quitting the role, leading to Pierce Brosnan being cast as the fifth official James Bond actor. The reworked and re-cast 007 outing, GoldenEye finally made it to the cinemas in November 1995.
See GoldenEye (soundtrack)
In the movie GoldenEye, a number of the AK-74 rifles that were used were not real AK-74s but non-Russian made Kalashnikov rifles that were made to look like the AK-74 rifle. The folding-stock variant AK-74 rifles that were seen in GoldenEye were Chinese-made Norinco Type 56/AKM rifles that were fitted with AK-74-style muzzle brakes and Russian-make red bakelite plastic magazines that were made for the AKM rifle in the 1970s. The rifles that were fitted with fixed buttstocks were real, Russian-made AK-74 rifles.
GoldenEye was adapted into a highly regarded video game for the Nintendo 64 by Rareware. At the time of its release, it was considered a flagship game for the new N64 console, and was considered revolutionary in its use of the first-person shooter format which led to many imitators; it is still widely regarded as one of the best games of all time.
In the Autumn of 2004, Electronic Arts released GoldenEye: Rogue Agent for Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube and later the Nintendo DS. This is the first game based on the 007 franchise in which the player does not take on the role of James Bond himself; rather they control an aspiring 00-agent (named GoldenEye) who is recruited by Auric Goldfinger, the villain in the movie and book Goldfinger. The game has little to do with either the film GoldenEye or the N64 game, and was released to mediocre reviews and was criticized for using the ""GoldenEye"" name in an attempt to sell the game by riding on the success of Rare's game.
In 2010, Activision and Eurocom produced a re-imagining of the N64 Goldeneye game, albeit with major changes to the plot and graphics (Rare had been acquired by Microsoft). Some changes include the likeness of Daniel Craig as Bond instead of Pierce Brosnan, the removal of Boris, and different level layouts. Originally a Wii/DS exclusive, it was later released on the Xbox 360 and PS3 as Goldeneye: Reloaded. It was moderately well-received, though not to the extent of the original game.

379,/wiki/Elektra_King,"Elektra Vavra King was the daughter of wealthy oil tycoon, Sir Robert King, but also a criminal mastermind associated with terrorist, Renard. One of the two main antagonists in the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough, she was portrayed by French actress, Sophie Marceau, and also appeared in the film's accompanying novelization penned by Raymond Benson as well as its video games.
Elektra is the daughter of Sir Robert King and his second wife. Her maternal background is of Azerbaijani descent; the family had fled the country immediately after the Soviet Union was established and relocated to England. Robert King's marriage had become a much noted affair as he managed to acquire his father-in-law's oil business and assimilate it into his own construction enterprise, forming the official King Industries.
Elektra's subsequent birth was also subject of much press coverage, foreshadowing much of the attention she would receive later on in her early adulthood. As the only daughter of a lucrative oil baron, Elektra had a privileged upbringing, becoming a tad bit spoiled in the process. She attended prestigious private schools around Europe and often spent summer vacationing with her maternal family in the Middle East. After college, Elektra decided to follow in her father's footsteps and join King Enterprises.
Much to the media's delight, Elektra's business affiliation and beauty made her a well known figure in the press. The fame eventually drew the attention of the anarchist Renard, who decided to kidnap her in a scheme to extort a large sum from her father. Sir Robert refused to pay the ransom on the advice of family friend (and James Bond's boss) M. Embittered, she became Renard's lover and participated in his scheme to extort money from her family (going so far as to mutilate her own left ear so Renard could send it to her father as a warning) but pretended to have been traumatized by the kidnapping. (Bond thought she suffered from Stockholm syndrome, but may have been blinded by his affection for her).
Having survived the bombing, Valentin Zukovsky and his men take mount a raid on the tower. Reaching the room where Elektra has Bond, he is shot by her. Dying, Zukovsky uses his cane gun to free Bond, who then chases after the fleeing Elektra, freeing M in the process. During a tense standoff, and at the business end of a gun, Bond demands that Elektra order Renard to call off the imminent meltdown in the city. Elektra then taunts Bond, telling him that he wouldn't shoot her and that he would miss her as she didn't see him as a killer of a former lover in cold blood. She then radios Renard and in her overconfidence on her hold over Bond, she instead tells him to proceed with the plan, and out of anger, Bond immediately kills her with a single gunshot while exclaiming ""I never miss"".
Elektra was a woman who was used to getting what she wants. She did not like to be resisted and will do anything to get her way, including using her charms, torturing and killing anyone who tries to stand in her way. She's also an excellent tactician and actress who passes for an innocent girl when she's really one of the brains behind her operation.

380,/wiki/Arkady_Grigorovich_Ourumov,"General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov (In Russian: Аркадий Григорович Урумов) is the fictional commander of the Russian Space Division, a member of the Janus Syndicate and the tertiary antagonist of the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. Portrayed by the late German actor Gottfried John, the character would later appear in the 1997 video game GoldenEye 007, also as an antagonist.
In 1968, at the age of 18, he graduated from Moscow Military Academy. In 1970, he graduated from the School of Applied Military Science in Kiev. Later that year, he was promoted to Captain and was posted to an advanced Army Missile Test Range from 1970 to 1975.  
In 1975, he was promoted to Major and was assigned to the Soviet Space Division from 1975 to 1981. Ourumov then served in the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan where he survived the explosion of a nearby tank, giving him a phobia of them as a result. Some time later, he was promoted to Colonel and assigned to a Chemical Weapons Facility in Arkhangelsk.
In 1986, Ourumov, who had grown tiresome of having little power, was finally promoted to Colonel and was given the important job of being in charge of a Soviet Russian Chemical Weapons Factory. During his early days in his new position he meets a young and bitter Alec Trevelyan, who tells Ourumov of his past, his hatred for MI6 and his future intentions, but making sure to leave out a few vital details about himself. Alec offers Ourumov a part in his plan and that he will be paid well and receive his status as the next ""Iron Man Of Russia"", Ourumov graciously accepts. The two pledge not to see each other until Alec Trevelyan and James Bond were to go on a mission to destroy Ourumov's base. However, Ourumov and Trevelyan had different plans. Trevelyan deliberately gets himself caught by Ourumov and his men, and Bond witnesses Ourumov shooting Trevelyan in the head. Ourumov attempts to catch Bond and almost succeeds, but Bond just manages to escape.
The shooting was staged, however. Unbeknownst to Bond, Alec is alive, albeit deeply scarred on the right side of his face. He becomes an international terrorist under the name ""Janus"" (The two-faced Roman god). A disgraced Ourumov was later court-martialed for the destruction of the Arkangelsk chemical facility and facing the likely fate of a death sentence. However, Colonel Ourumov perjured himself by claiming one of his deceased underlings had failed to take precaution in caring for the chemical vats which caused the explosion. This explanation is bought by the Soviet command, and Ourumov is cleared of all charges and restored to position. Some time later, Colonel Ourumov receives a general's promotion and a new assignment with increased prestige: commander of the Severnaya Space Facility in Siberia. Ourumov also has the job of employing another member for The Janus Crime Syndicate - he hires Xenia Onatopp, an ex-Soviet fighter pilot, whom he is familiar with. For the next nine years The Janus Crime Syndicate would terrorize Russia without getting caught and all their identities remaining secret and Ourumov was earning more power, which was starting to trouble the Russian Government.
In 1995, the general completes the establishment of their syndicate's greatest weapon: ""GoldenEye"". Two GoldenEye satellite dishes were built: one in Siberia, and one hidden in Cuba. Anyone who became suspicious of Ourumov ended up dead at the hands, or perhaps the thighs, of Xenia.
The Syndicate's first act is the theft of the Tiger helicopter - Ourumov and Xenia personally took care of the operation under the strict order of Janus not to fail. They successfully manage to steal it before Bond can stop them, and arrive in Siberia hours later where the second act of their operation would take place. Ourumov made sure to hire the most intelligent computer programmer to take care of the GoldenEye weapon: Boris Grishenko. Ourumov and Xenia enter the satellite base where the corrupt general orders one of his men to give him the GoldenEye and authorization codes they need to testfire the GoldenEye. Upon receiving these, Xenia suddenly shoots everyone in the base, and together they arm the GoldenEye to fire on Severnaya in order to eliminate the evidence. However, one employee of the Severnaya facility, Natalya Simonova, was in the break lounge at the time of the shooting and spared the massacre. Her hiding is almost discovered by Ourumov, but the noises heard are chalked up to another surviving employee who covertly activates an alarm, then is quickly shot again by Xenia.
Ourumov and Xenia take Boris with them and escape moments before the GoldenEye weapon detonates. Meanwhile, at a Russian air base two hundred kilometers away, the activated alarm is heard and three pilots are ordered to fly to Severnaya to thwart any attackers. However, the electromagnetic storm that fires on Severnaya fries the circuitry in the MiGs, causing all three pilots to be killed with one crashing into the radar dish at the facility. Natalya survives by hiding in a cupboard then escaping into the tundra, calling for Boris. As this is happening, Xenia and Ourumov are protected from the EMP blast by their stolen helicopter. Afterwards, Ourumov proceeds to Saint Petersburg to report to Defence Minister Dmitri Mishkin. Ourumov blames the Severnaya attack on Siberian separatists and resigns his command of the program due to his apparent failure to stop this, but is then shocked to learn that Simonova is alive and he leaves immediately, frustrated with Xenia's failure to kill ""everyone"". He assigns Boris and Xenia to find her, which doesn't take them long. Ourumov takes Simonova to Alec's hideout, where he ties her up in the Tiger helicopter to await her death. Bond also ends up in the helicopter, moments after learning that Trevelyan is alive and that he is a traitor. Bond and Natalya escape moments before the Tiger helicopter's heat-seeking missiles fire back on itself, but they are soon caught by Russian troops and taken to the military intelligence archives and locked in a prison cell.
Later, upon hearing that Dimitri Mishkin has Bond and Natalya in custody, Ourumov arrives and storms into the cell where Mishkin is interrogating the pair. Ourumov argues with Mishkin, trying to convince him that Bond is the traitor. Believing Natalya's story concerning Ourumov's treachery, Mishkin yells for a guard to arrest him, but the general quickly shoots Mishkin's bodyguard and then Mishkin himself with Bond's gun. After improvising a cover story, Ourumov then calls for the guards to kill Bond and Simonova. However, the spy hurls a chair into Ourumov's legs and struggles him, then throws him headlong into a wall. While he's dazed, Bond takes on two soldiers who enter the cell, then arms himself before escaping with Simonova. Ourumov leads his soldiers throughout the archives, searching for the pair. Ourumov's men manage to capture Simonova, leaving Bond to escape on his own. Ourumov takes her and one of his men and they escape out onto the streets of St. Petersburg by car, but Bond hijacks a tank and suddenly bursts through a wall in pursuit. He leaves a path of destruction behind him as he chases Ourumov through the busy roads, but the general soon arrives at Alec's converted missile train.
Ourumov boards the train with Simonova, and explains to Alec that Bond has escaped. Later, their journey is halted by Bond, who uses the hijacked tank to stop the train. He then boards the damaged train and holds Trevelyan and Xenia at gunpoint. Ourumov is called into the room, holding a gun to Simonova's head. Bond reveals to Ourumov that Alec is a Lienz Cossack, leaving Ourumov shocked - however, Trevelyan smooths things over by telling him how rich and powerful he will soon be. He then nods for Ourumov to shoot Simonova, but his real intention is for Ourumov to distract Bond while he and Xenia escape, turning the general into a sacrificial lamb. At this point, Ourumov is too slow and ends up being shot to his death by Bond's Kalashnikov, thereby putting an end to the ""Iron Man Of Russia""'s life.
During his time as a soldier, Ourumov's T55 tank was attacked by another tank. Ourumov was the only survivor, and the accident left him with a fear of tanks. After his Military Career, he worked as the overseer of the chemical facility near Archangel port, where he met Janus before the laboratory's destruction, and his promotion. He was given a position in the Russian Ministry of Defense, and was placed in charge of the GoldenEye weapon. However, he began to work with the crime boss Janus to help him steal the GoldenEye. Ourumov and Xenia Onatopp were sent to Monacco to steal the experimental Tigre helicopter. They then took it to the Severnaya facility, and set the GoldenEye that was stored there to destroy it before stealing the device, and flying away. After reporting the attack as the work of Siberian Separatists to Minister of Defense Viktor Mishkin, he was informed that a Severnaya worker had escaped. After trying desperately to find this one person who may have seen him at the facility before detonation, he discovered that James Bond and the programmer Natalya Simonova were being interrogated by Mishkin. Ourumov burst in on the interrogation to defend himself against any possible hints that he was not loyal to Russia, and killed Mishkin before capturing Simonova and taking her to Janus. On the way, Bond chased them through St. Petersburg in a tank. After arriving at Janus' trainyard Ourumov killed the driver of his car and handed Natalya off to Xenia. Ourumov then guarded Simonova on the short journey before he was called to bring her to another car. There James Bond informed him that Janus was a Cossack. This caused Ourumov to question his loyalties before being shot in the head by the escaping Janus.

381,/wiki/General_Medrano,"General Luiz Medrano was a fictional exiled Bolivian General and the archenemy of intelligence operative Camille Montes. Portrayed by Mexican actor, Joaquin Cosio, the character acted as the secondary antagonist in the 2008 James Bond film, Quantum of Solace. Medrano also appeared in the film's video game adaptation of the same name, voiced by American actor, Alex Fernandez.
General Medrano was once the military dictator of his home country, Bolivia, but was later overthrown and exiled. He later made a deal with criminal organization Quantum to overthrow the current Bolivian government, and in return, Dominic Greene (through his company Greene Planet) will be given ownership of a seemingly barren piece of Bolivian land for its vast resources. An infamous man, he is ready to plunge his country into drought and famine, condemning many innocent people, to give him a pretext to seize power. Following Mr. White's escape from MI6 custody, Medrano is first seen at Greene's port when he is introduced to Camille Montes, who is secretly working for Bolivian intelligence. It was later revealed that Medrano previously murdered Camille's family when she was young; he murdered her father and raped her mother and sister before burning their house down with Camille inside, though she managed to escape.
As of the plot, Medrano arranges for Colonel Carlos to murder his contact René Mathis and frame James Bond for it so that the Bolivian authorities will catch on to him. In the climax, Medrano attempts to finalize his deal with Quantum at Perla de las Dunas, a hotel in Bolivia's Atacama Desert, for his coup. After signing the paperwork given by Elvis, Medrano is presented with a new contract that will allow Quantum to use Bolivia's sole water utility company to sell at higher rates. Medrano initially refuses to sign this new contract, but Greene silently threatens to have him replaced if he does not comply, daring Medrano to have his right-hand man named Lieutenant Orso shoot him if he wishes to. Unwilling to take his chances in resisting against Greene's orders, Medrano reluctantly signs the contract and receives his share of the money as promised.
Despite getting his share as promised, Medrano is frustrated by this turn of events, so he tries to vent it off by attempting to rape his maid in his suite. However, Bond and Camille lead a full assault in the hotel, killing all of Greene's thugs and Medrano's men in the process. As Bond fights against Greene, Camille kills Orso before making her way to Medrano' suite, where she frees the maid and lets her escape. However, Medrano attacks Camille, gloating of the time when he raped and killed her mother. Medrano then tries to rape Camille, but she fights back and grabs her gun, aiming at the general. Swearing that she will burn, Medrano (with an evil smile) foolishly charges at Camille in an attempt to kill her, but the latter forcibly shoots the hated general in the head, killing him and ending her quest for vengeance. Camille would later escape from the burning hotel with Bond, leaving Medrano's corpse to be buried in the rubble.
Medrano is a completely sadistic, remorseless, perverse and brutal individual, making him the most evil character in Daniel Craig's chronology, topped only by Franz Oberhauser. He has a thirst for power, willing to conspire with Greene to become dictator of Bolivia. He seems to be consider rape as banal, the mother and older sister of Camille being sad examples and he would also raped his maid out of frustration, if Camille hadn't intervened. He's a skilled fighter, as shown with Camille in the hotel.

He is responsible for the murder of James Bond's friend and ally Sharkey and brings the man's corpse and fishing boat back to Krest - strung up alongside a dead shark. Ordering the boat to be disposed of, he climbs back on-board Krest's ship, only to be met by 007; who picks up a nearby harpoon gun and shoots him in the stomach with a dry ""Compliments of Sharkey"". His body falls overboard into the ocean and Bond subsequently uses Clive's oxygen tank to hide underwater.

384,/wiki/Dr._Tedworth,"Dr. Malcolm Tedworth was a fictional British researcher employed by Midhurst Laboratories and tasked with developing biological warfare antidotes for the Ministry of Defence. The character appeared in the 2010 video-game, James Bond 007: Blood Stone, and was voiced by Timothy Watson.
Dr. Malcolm Tedworth was a lead scientist in a Midhurst Laboratories project to investigate smallpox and anthrax; developing antidotes for the British armed forces, for use in the event of a biological attack. In a bid to extract details of his research which might be weaponized, Tedworth was kidnapped from his yacht in the English Channel by mercenaries in the hire of Russian oligarch, Stefan Pomerov. He was brought to Istanbul, where he was held captive by Bernin in the Byzantine catacombs underneath the city, along with fellow bio-tech researchers 'Remy' and Dr. S. Justacomins, director of bio-engineering at the University of Stuttgart. He is initially presumed dead as a result of a sudden squall capsizing his yacht, however MI6 is tipped off to his presence in Turkey (believing him to be selling his research) and dispatches James Bond to investigate. 007 arrives too late to rescue Tedworth from electric-shock interrogation; under pressure he divulges the password to the encrypted USB drive containing his research and is shot dead by his interlocutors. Bond later uncovers footage of his torture in Pomerov's safe.
In the Nintendo DS version of Blood Stone, instead of whispering out the password to his torturers prior to his execution, Tedworth tearfully says out loud that it was his phone number, twice.

385,/wiki/GE_M134_Minigun,"The GE M134 Minigun appears in multiplayer mode only as a fixed weapon and is available only with certain weapon sets. Care must be taken when using the weapon, as prolonged bursts can cause it to overheat and stop working until it cools back down.
The GE M134 Minigun appears twice in the game, first seen mounted on the tank commandeered by Bond in the ""Streets of Bucharest"" level, and later are seen in the ""Forbidden Depths"" level, where Bond has to be careful of Ceiling mounted M134s that open fire on him when he approaches them. Dillion Aero M134 Miniguns can be seen mounted in various places, including on the EMP-hardened transport helicopter in 007: Legends.
In Episode 3 (""The Chameleon"") of the 1991–92 spin-off animated television series, James Bond Jr., an M134 Minigun is part of the armament of the Robot Armored Tactical Soldier (or R.A.T.S.). As with many similar cartoons aimed at a younger audience, the show's depiction of weaponry was influenced by the need to meet moral, ethical, and legal content standards. Consequently, futuristic laser blasters were a staple during its run, with the M134 Minigun standing out as one of the few examples of ballistic weaponry in the series.

386,/wiki/Amazonian_launch_complex,"The Amazonian launch complex was a fictional covert space-shuttle launch site constructed by billionaire industrialist, Hugo Drax, and was concealed among the ruins of an extinct ancient civilization near the River Tapirapé, in north-central Brazil. The facility appeared prominently in the 1979 James Bond film, Moonraker. The iconic location would later be inspiration for a level in the 1997 video-game, Goldeneye 007, and would be re-imagined as a private space-tourism port for the 2012 game, 007 Legends.
The secret Moonraker launch complex is constructed under and around the ruins of an extinct Mesoamerican civilization, rendered infertile by long-term exposure to the pollen of the Orchidae Nigra (or 'black orchid'). The orchid continues to grow among the ancient stone structures and has been weaponized into a nerve agent by Drax's scientists as part of his scheme to wipe out humanity and repopulate the Earth with his 'master race'.
James Bond stumbles upon the launch site whilst searching for the source of the orchid toxin and is lured by one of Drax's girls into an ancient pyramid structure. In an idyllic garden cavern he is tossed into a pool of water by a hidden mechanism, and is forced to kill a large constricting snake to escape the death trap. He is dragged from the water by Jaws and is brought to an angular Launch Control Center lined with monitors. There he witnesses the launch of the shuttles and Drax reveals his plans. Bond and his CIA contact, Dr. Holly Goodhead, are then left to die in a flame exhaust pit under Moonraker #5 and narrowly escape by blowing apart a vent cover. The pair disguise themselves as pilots and escape the complex by riding on Moonraker #6.
Known for its reputation as one of the hardest levels in the game, featured enemies include hidden drone guns and an infinite number of re-spawning Moonraker Elites armed with US AR33 rifles, Moonraker laser rifles and grenades. Jaws appears in this level as an enemy, dual wielding AR33 rifles. After defeating Jaws and pocketing his key-card, Bond must enter the computer room, reprogram the guidance system and launch the shuttle in the hangar to complete the mission.
"
387,/wiki/General_Gogol_(Walter_Gotell),"Ministry of Foreign AffairsDespite the popular assumption about the James Bond series' Cold War focus, Gogol is never depicted as a true villain. At his most hostile, he is a respectful competitor and more often is an ally against the common foes of peace. His first appearance is in The Spy Who Loved Me, where he is seen sending Anya Amasova to recover an important roll of microfilm.
Later in the film, Gogol and James Bond's superior, M, form an alliance, which is the start of the Anglo-Soviet relationship as a result of their mutual pursuit of Karl Stromberg.
Gogol is seen next in Moonraker, talking to USAF Colonel Scott over the telephone about Hugo Drax's space station. He tells the Americans it is not a Soviet station and that they would investigate it themselves after the US had intercepted it. Colonel Scott apologizes for calling Gogol at a bad time due to the time differences, but Gogol says there is nothing to apologize over, as ""problems in Russia keep him awake"", just as he is seen with an attractive Russian woman in a nightgown.
In For Your Eyes Only, Gogol wants to buy an ATAC communicator from Aristotle Kristatos, after the ship carrying it is sunk in an accident. Kristatos recovers the unit and arranges a sale at his private headquarters, but Gogol arrives there just as Bond and his allies are going after Kristatos for the murders he has committed to retrieve the device. When Bond throws it off a cliff, Gogol is initially dismayed but keeps his guard from shooting Bond; as Bond notes that his actions maintain détente, Gogol chuckles as he acknowledges Bond's observation that the machine's destruction allows the nations to remain in their relatively peaceful status quo. The assistant of General Gogol, appearing briefly in For Your Eyes Only, is called Rubelvitch, a wordplay on the name Moneypenny.
In Octopussy, when General Orlov proposes invading the West, Gogol is the loudest voice opposing the reckless plan, asserting both the danger of provoking a nuclear war and that the USSR wants peace, not war. Gogol's investigations of Orlov's scheme to weaken NATO's defence runs parallel to Bond's, but his subordinates' unauthorized fatal shooting of the traitor prevents him from learning the full details of his plot and warning NATO, though Bond is able to stop Orlov's plan on his behalf, and later appears before M to inform him that his government will deny the incident and request that Bond return their treasure Romanov Star that he has in his possession which Orlov previously stole.
In A View to A Kill, Gogol in first seen in France. He reprimands Max Zorin, an erstwhile KGB agent, for killing 007 without the KGB's approval beforehand. Zorin thinks of himself as no longer part of the KGB. Gogol also learns of Operation Main Strike, and demands Zorin stop at once.
When Zorin defies the order to stop his plan, Gogol sends KGB agent Pola Ivanova to see what Zorin is up to. When Pola meets Bond, she tries to take the tape from him and give it to Gogol. Gogol is embarrassed that Pola got the wrong tape.
At the end of the film, Gogol awards Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's plan to destroy Silicon Valley, stating that Bond was the first non-Soviet citizen to receive it and that the KGB has its own heart of operations producing their own technology at Silicon Valley (being awarded this medal contradicts a statement in the novel Goldfinger that stated that people in the British Secret Service could not accept awards from foreign services, no matter how friendly (such as the CIA). However, Bond may not have accepted the award, and the Russians may have insisted he was awarded it anyway, whether he'd accepted the medal or not.)
In The Living Daylights, Gogol is mentioned as having retired from the KGB and his position being succeeded by General Pushkin, He is only seen in the end, as a diplomat in the Foreign Ministry. He attends Kara Milovy's concert with M, offering Milovy a visa which would allow her to leave the Eastern bloc at will.

388,/wiki/Chuck_Lee,"Chuck Lee was a fictional American intelligence operative employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Serving as James Bond's American ally in San Francisco, the character appeared in the 1985 James Bond film A View to a Kill and was portrayed by British actor David Yip.
Serving as 007's CIA contact, Lee meets him at Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, where he is posing as a fish stand worker. The pair exchange sign/countersigns and walk along the wharf, discussing industrialist Max Zorin's activities. Lee provides details on the individuals 007 covertly photographed during Zorin's thoroughbred sale at his French chateau; identifying Bob Conley and Dr. Carl Mortner, real name Hans Glaub, who is revealed to be a former Nazi scientist specializing in eugenics. He also draws Bond's attention to mysterious activities taking place around one of Zorin's oil pumping stations and introduces him to one of the local fishermen. Lee later meets with Bond at the home of oil heiress, Stacey Sutton, to exchange and update information about Zorin. Suspecting Zorin of attempting to create an artificial earthquake, Lee leaves to inform his superiors in the CIA. However, as he climbs into the driver's seat of his car, he is strangled from behind by Zorin's assassin, May Day. The San Francisco Police Department later informs Bond, who they suspect of his murder, that Lee's body was found in Chinatown.

389,/wiki/Dr._Carl_Mortner,"Dr. Carl Mortner, born Hans Glaub, was a fictional German geneticist who served Hitler and the Nazi regime during the Second World War. He later became the head scientist of wealthy businessman, Max Zorin. A major antagonist portrayed by British actor, Willoughby Gray, the character first appeared in the 1985 James Bond film, A View to a Kill, and was subsequently adapted for the 1983-87 tabletop role-playing game, James Bond 007: Role-Playing In Her Majesty's Secret Service.
Born Hans Glaub in 1913, at some point in his life he began a career in science, with an interest in breeding and genetics. His methods were akin to the infamous mad scientist Josef Mengele, who had little regard for human life, requesting the Nazis send some concentration camp subjects to him for purposes of experimentation, to be treated like lab rats. Hans Glaub's speciality was steroids and hormonal experimentation on pregnant women who were corraled into the concentration camps. Most of Glaub's experiments ended in failure, causing most of the experimented mothers to miscarry. However, a handful of women did successful deliver babies. These babies were often psycotic in nature, but grew into children with gifted intelligence. Glaub took an interest in such ""super kids"" one of whom was Max Zorin, whom he took special care.
Unlike many of his fellow Nazis, Glaub escaped facing justice at the Nuremburg Commission following the end of World War II. A Soviet military unit had attacked Glaub's facility during the war. Realizing Glaub's potential, the unit chose to transport him to the Soviet Union. Glaub spent fifteen years in the Soviet Union, where he was ordered to make steroids for their athletes. He fled the USSR sometime in the 1960s, taking Max Zorin with him. Glaub gave himself the false identity of ""Carl Mortner"" and resumed his work in genetics, now working on horses. He had discovered a way to make horses faster without doping. Glaub used Zorin's microchips in the brains of horses, which acted as receiver for a silver-tipped cane. Zorin used the cane as a remote control, pointing it at a running horse which would cause its brain to release adrenaline, and thus run faster. He covered up his activity by falsely claiming the horses got their abilities through complex selective breeding.
Then in May 1985, an MI6 agent, James Bond, began to sniff Zorin in their stable and Glaub intrigue a Bond's colleague, Sir Godfrey Tibbett. The doctor meet Bond as he leaves Max Zorin's study, pretending to be looking for the bar. As the doctor escorts Bond to where he should be, Bond asks him about how Zorin's horses always seem to win, and is introduced to another henchman, Bob Conley, and Zorin himself.
He later appears after Bond breaks into Zorin's lab and tells Zorin that 007 has been snooping around in places he shouldn't have been as he discovered that a microchip has been misplaced in the cabinet due to Bond's hastiness during his escape from the lab. 
Mortner subsequently travels to San Francisco and colludes in Zorin's plan to cause an artificial double-earthquake; permanently submerging Silicon Valley underwater and granting Zorin Industries a monopoly in microchip production. He meets his death shortly after Bond and Zorin have their final fight on the Golden Gate Bridge. He awakens after having been knocked unconscious by Stacey Sutton into the Zorin’s airship immediately before the fight. When Mortner sees Zorin fall to his death from the bridge, he reacts violently, pulling out a pistol and firing at Bond and Sutton in retaliation for the death of his adopted son. Once his pistol runs out of ammunition, he goes into a cabinet, pulls out a small bundle of dynamite, lights the fuse, and walks toward the cabin door, seeking to throw the dynamite at Bond and Sutton. Bond, however, uses Zorin's axe to cut through the rope anchoring the blimp to the bridge, causing Mortner to lose his balance and drop the dynamite in the cabin as the blimp floats away. Scarpine, who has just regained consciousness, panics and tries to wrestle the dynamite away from Mortner and extinguish the fuse, but it explodes while they are fighting over it, destroying the blimp's cabin and killing both of the men (who would have died when they fell into the San Francisco Bay even if they somehow survived the explosion).

390,/wiki/Hector_Gonzales_(Literary),"Gonzales was a Cuban hitman employed by Herr von Hammerstein to murder the Havelocks in the James Bond short-story ""For Your Eyes Only"".
Gonzales is a hired assassin in the employ of Herr von Hammerstein, a former Gestapo officer working for Batista in Cuba. After von Hammerstein is dismissed by Batista he hires Gonzales to convince Colonel Timothy Havelock to sell his Jamaican estate to von Hammerstein, though he refuses. Gonzales then steps aside and the pair are gunned down by two Cuban bandits at the direction of their leader, Major Gonzales; all three work then promptly leave.
At the request of M, Bond travels to Vermont, via Canada, to track down von Hammerstein at his rented estate at Echo Lake. When Bond arrives on the scene, he finds the Havelocks' daughter, Judy, who intends to carry out her own mission of revenge. Judy kills von Hammerstein by shooting him in the back with a bow and arrow from 100 yards (91 m) away at the exact moment that he dives into a lake. A shoot-out then occurs between Bond, von Hammerstein's men and Gonzales. Judy is injured in the process, but Bond kills all of them.

Elmo Clayton was America's largest manufacturer and father of heiress, Margo Xerophanos. He was involved in the creation of Clayton Computrex, Ltd. - a joint Anglo-American venture between his own technology firm, Clayton Computers, and Computrex. Together they had developed revolutionary new computer technology with implications to the military and space fields. Clayton became the target of a plot by his industrialist son-in-law, Xerxes Xerophanos; who intended to destroy his rivals' new manufacturing plant with a stolen nuclear warhead and inherit his wife's fortune. After travelling to Britain for the plant's dedication ceremony, Mr. Clayton and his staff were assailed by Xerophanos' remote-controlled, warhead-equipped tank. Before it could be detonated, James Bond escaped on-board the villain's control ship - dumping the vessel's fuel into the sea and threatening to set it alight; detonating a second nuclear bomb Xerophanos held on-board as insurance. The mogul was subsequently shot to death by his own mutinous crew. In the aftermath, Bond was personally thanked by Clayton.

403,/wiki/Blofeld_(Dawson/Pohlmann),"Initially a partially unseen character portrayed by Anthony Dawson and Eric Pohlmann (Voice), Blofeld was subsequently played on screen by Donald Pleasence, Telly Savalas and Charles Gray. A final depiction of the character (unnamed for copyright reasons) appeared in the pre-title sequence of For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by John Hollis and voiced by Robert Rietty. Following years of litigation over the ownership of the character, Blofeld was later re-invented for the Daniel Craig continuity of James Bond films (2006-2021), portrayed by Christoph Waltz.
Arriving at an isolated part of the base, Blofeld activates the base's self destruct system before fleeing. Although Blofeld escaped, Bond managed to destroy the rocket remotely before it could capture more astronauts.
Now the subject of an international man-hunt by the British Secret Service titled Operation Bedlam, Blofeld establishes a clinical allergy-research institute atop Piz Gloria in the Swiss Alps. James Bond investigates the office of Swiss lawyer Gumbold, and learns that Blofeld is corresponding with London College of Arms' genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, attempting to claim the aristocratic title ""Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp"". He ventures to Switzerland posing as Bray to gather intelligence on Blofeld, who has went to the lengths of having his earlobes surgically removed to back-up his claims of nobility. There he learns that Blofeld secretly plans to contaminate and ultimately sterilize the world's food supply using biological warfare, carried by his brainwashed Angels of Death. Blofeld claimed he would not carry out his plan if all his past crimes were pardoned and he is recognised as the current Count de Bleauchamp. Bond tries to trick Blofeld into leaving Switzerland so that MI6 can arrest him without violating Swiss sovereignty. Blofeld refuses and Bond is eventually caught by henchwoman Irma Bunt. Blofeld reveals that he identified Bond after his attempt to lure him out of Switzerland, and tells his men to take the agent away. Bond eventually makes his escape by skiing down Piz Gloria while Blofeld and his men give chase.
Aided by his future wife, Tracy, the next morning their flight resumes. However, they are intercepted by Blofeld, who sets off an avalanche; resulting in Tracy's capture, while Bond is buried but manages to escape. M tells 007 that Blofeld's ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. Bond then enlists Marc-Ange Draco and his Unione Corse forces to attack Piz Gloria, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a bobsleigh, with Bond pursuing him. The chase ends when Blofeld becomes snared in a tree branch, ripping him out of the bobsled and apparently killing him. Subsequently, Bond and Tracy marry in Portugal and pull over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car. As they converse, Blofeld (wearing a neck brace) and Bunt commit a drive-by shooting of the couple's car - with Blofeld driving, and Bunt firing the gun. Bond survives, but Tracy is killed in the attack.
Following the pipeline trail, 007 breaks into Willard Whyte's penthouse apartment only to be unexpectedly confronted with two identical Blofelds (who uses an electronic device to sound like Whyte). Bond kills one of the Blofelds, but he turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, where he is picked up by Blofeld's assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd and taken out to Las Vegas Valley where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. Bond escapes and calls Blofeld posing as his right-hand man, Bert Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and rescues him, but in the meantime Blofeld retreats to his oil platform off the coast of Baja California. In the process of escaping he abducts Bond's smuggler ally, Tiffany Case. With the satellite now in orbit, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, then proposes an international auction. Bond travels to the oil platform and is captured in an attempt to sabotage the weapon. Shortly afterwards Felix Leiter and the CIA begin a helicopter attack on the rig. In the ensuing chaos Blofeld attempts to escape using a midget submarine, but Bond gains control of the submarine's launch crane and crashes the sub into the control room, causing both the satellite control and the base to be destroyed.
Blofeld evidently survived the attack and resurfaced years later (dialogue in Marvel's comic adaptation would suggest 10 years after their last encounter) with a plan to exact revenge on his old adversary, James Bond, for foiling his plans and causing the downfall of his criminal organisation. Now wheelchair-bound, bald and wearing a neck-brace, Blofeld rigs a ""Universal Exports""-emblazoned Bell 206 helicopter with remote control hardware and remotely electrocutes the pilot after he collects 007. Taking control of the aircraft over a London gasworks, Blofeld toys with Bond before attempting to crash the flying death-trap in a warehouse. However, 007 regains control of the aircraft and impales Blofeld's wheelchair on its landing gear, lifting the villain into the skies. After toying with his nemesis, Bond drops the pleading Blofeld down a tall industrial chimney stack, killing him from the impact, avenging Tracy's death.
Ernst Stavro Blofeld's personality, in its authoritarian and inhuman megalomania, fits perfectly in the line of such infamous historical names as Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler or Stalin. Despite his absolutely ruthless character, he possessed an exceptionally calm and calculating mind, always acting in a thoughtful manner and leaving nothing to chance.
Although Blofeld was more of a strategist and a master thinker in the background, he was not afraid to personally intervene in the battle if necessary. However, he was most courageous when surrounded by a sufficiently large armed bodyguard, otherwise he cultivated a rather defensive fighting style, whose main goal was his safe escape. He also was a self-concerned megalomaniac who only cared about results, profit, power, and world domination, no matter how many henchmen he needs to sacrifice or innocent lives need to be lost in the process.
Even with several other Bond villains with massive attempted body counts, Blofeld’s plots were easily among the worst and most destructive in the franchise, having threatened millions of innocent lives and planned widespread, irreparable destruction, all stemming from megalomania and other purely selfish reasons without the faintest notion of good intentions.
Although not present in the novel, Blofeld makes his first on-screen appearance in From Russia with Love, portrayed by Anthony Dawson and voiced by Eric Pohlmann. Both men remained uncredited, the end credits listed a question mark instead of an actor’s name. In this appearance his face is not seen and only his lower body is visible as he strokes his trademark white cat, discussing a plan to avenge the death of their member Doctor Julius No by setting a trap that will put Bond and Russian agent Tatiana Romanova in a position where it will appear that they killed each other while escaping to escalate tensions in the Cold War. After being absent from Goldfinger, Blofeld returned in Thunderball.
Right before Blofeld is killed, he begs to Bond to spare him, and cryptically bribes him with a delicatessen in stainless steel. This line had been added in by the producer of the film, Albert R. Broccoli, as a throwback to Mafia slang for a very cushy bribe used during the time and place he was growing up in (as at the time, having a delicatessen in stainless steel was considered luxurious especially if the owner was a street vendor).
The classic depiction of Blofeld has appeared in a number of James Bond video games as a playable multiplayer character. His first appearance was in the 2004 first-person shooter video game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, developed by EA LA and published by Electronic Arts. During its development official footage of character renders released by the publisher featured the terrorist leader 'Number One' holding his Persian Cat, with the likeness of Donald Pleasence. Likely due to legalities, in the final product the character's face is obscured, shot from behind and from the neck downwards. Number 1 was voiced by actor Gideon Emery using a similar intonation to Pleasence's portrayal of the character.

405,/wiki/Denise,"Second-in-command of the Pussy Galore's Flying CircusDenise is a fictional high-ranking member of Pussy Galore's Flying Circus, a female aviator team led by Pussy Galore under the employ of the infamous businessman, Auric Goldfinger. The character appeared in the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger and was portrayed by British actress Aleta Morrison.
Denise and the others members of Pussy Galore's Flying Circus are involved in Auric Goldfinger's ""Operation Grand Slam"" consists to infiltrate Fort Knox, being in charge to dispensing the Delta 9 nerve gas across the aera of the bank in order to kill 60,000 people. So, Goldfinger and his task force (led by Oddjob and Kisch) to smuggle an atomic bomb (created by Mr. Ling) into the vault. Such an action would make the gold radioactive and useless for 58 years, and that the value of Goldfinger's gold will increase many times, thus making Goldfinger the richest man in the world.
Upon the arrival of James Bond (as he was invited to personally witness the preparations of the operation after being captured by Goldfinger), Denise is seen landing her plane before greeting Galore, who assures her and the other pilots that they will get their assignments tomorrow night. She then dismisses them for the day before transporting Bond to Goldfinger's ranch, where the secret agent learns of Goldfinger's plot. With that in mind, Bond seduces Galore into foiling Goldfinger's plan, so she has Denise and the pilots to replace the nerve gas with a harmless one while alerting the U.S. government about Goldfinger's plan. It is unknown what happens to Denise and the other pilots following the deaths of Goldfinger and his men.
In the script, when we first meet her her name is listed as Althea but later on it says Denise. Either this was a mistake or the two were mashed into one.

406,/wiki/Dimitrios,"Alex Dimitrios was a fictional government contractor and associate of Quantum financier, Le Chiffre. The character appeared in the 2006 James Bond film, Casino Royale, portrayed by French actor, Simon Abkarian, and was later seen in the 2008 video-game Quantum of Solace.
Alex Dimitrios is discovered by James Bond after the message decoding in Mollaka's cell, one of its contractors, killed by Bond in Madagascar. Located at MI6 in the Bahamas, Bond discovers where he lives on the island and knows his wife, Solange, riding a beautiful white horse on the beach. In the evening at the casino, Bond sits down at a poker table where Dimitrios ais playing. The game continues until Solange appears, but she is berated by her husband for lateness, hinting at his recent bad luck with the cards. At one point, Dimitrios, decided to recover his losses, goes all-in and raises the stakes with a check, but is warned by the croupier that the players are only allowed to bet what's on the table; he then decides to bet his car, an Aston Martin DB5, the keys of which were already on the table. Bond convinces the croupier to allow Dimitrios to bet the car, and goes all-in. At first, Dimitrios' confidence in his hand (three kings) seems to pay off, but Bond reveals his hand (three aces) shortly after, and wins: the Aston Martin, together with Dimitrios' cash, is his.
After the game, Dimitrios meets Le Chiffre on his luxury yacht to receive instructions while Bond, having seduced Solange after appearing in front of her with her husband's car, makes love with the woman in the villa where he stayed, to get more information about Alex. Dimitrios calls his wife saying he will have to go to Miami, allowing Bond to go after him. Dimitrios is in Miami to hand another terrorist the hardware required to blow up the new aircraft Skyfleet S570, which is about to be unveiled at the Miami International Airport. He successfully drops the hardware, but is confronted by Bond in a knife-fight and ends up dead, stabbed by 007 who then leaves his body sitting upright in a chair.
During the course of the 2008 video-game 007: Quantum of Solace, Bond opens up to Camille Montes about the death of his former love, recounting the events of Casino Royale. The player follows through the plot of Casino Royale, with Bond infiltrating a Science Center to kill Dimitrios. In an introductory cut-scene the character is identified as an arms dealer and private contractor. Unlike the film, he is described as a naturalized United States citizen of Lebanese descent.

407,/wiki/Claus,"Claus was a fictional mercenary and assassin working for Greek smuggler Aris Kristatos under the supervision of his chief enforcer, Locque. The character appeared in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by actor Charles Dance.
Arriving in the Italian ski resort of Cortina, James Bond narrowly saves the life of Melina Havelock after she is attacked by two men on motorcycles. Although Bond apparently kills one of the assassins, the second escapes. It is unknown if the fleeing cyclist was Claus or another mercenary.
Later, Bond attends a biathlon event with Aris Kristatos' protégée, Bibi Dahl. Observing Bond leave the biathlon course, and sensing an opportunity to kill him, Locque signals for Claus and his accomplice to cut him off. Meanwhile, his fellow henchman, Erich Kriegler, attempts to snipe Bond from above. Bond manages to evade Kriegler, skiing into the path of Claus. Performing a somersault leap from a mound of snow, 007 knocks Claus to the ground and, despite a flurry of small arms fire, manages to escape to the relative safety of the Olympic ski jump.
Following him, Locque and Claus enter a lift with Bond. At the top, the pair split up - Locque preventing Bond from retreating back and Claus preparing to kill him on the way down the 90-meter Olympic ski jump. At the same time, Kriegler arrives at the base of the jump and prepares to snipe Bond. With no other option available, the spy is forced to use the slope. As he begins his descent, Claus forces his way on to the jump and brawls with Bond. Both men make the jump and as they land, Bond knocks Claus off his feet and makes his escape.
Later, Claus and two other henchmen fight Bond in the hockey rink, but the three henchmen are defeated by him.
Claus makes one final appearance later in the film as he and another unnamed driver aid Locque in his attempt to murder Bond and Lisl von Schlaf. Using dune buggies, the pair drive Lisl into the path of Locque's vehicle. She is killed instantly. Seconds later, Claus clips Bond with his buggy and holds him at gunpoint. He orders him into Locque's vehicle, but never finishes his sentence; he is struck in the back by a harpoon fired by one of Milos Columbo's men.

411,/wiki/6,"Classic continuityModern continuityThe Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), more commonly known as MI6 (originally Military Intelligence Section 6), or the Secret Service or simply Six, is the United Kingdom's external intelligence agency. SIS is responsible for the United Kingdom's human intelligence (HUMINT) espionage activities overseas, as opposed to the Security Service (MI5) which is charged with internal security within the UK. The Republic of Ireland also falls within MI5's remit. It was founded in October 1909 (along with MI5) as the Foreign Section of the Secret Service Bureau.
From Ian Fleming's 1953 debut novel, Casino Royale, Commander James Bond was employed by the semi-fictional ""Secret Service"". It has appeared in almost every subsequent story in the James Bond franchise. For the most part, the Secret Service has been subsequently identified with the real-life SIS/MI6 in continuation literature and films; one major exception being Jeffery Deaver's literary continuity, which placed Bond in a fictional department named the Overseas Development Group. Fleming's SIS typically operates under the cover-name ""Universal Exports"" and is comprised of subsections such as the 00 section and their research and development division, Q Branch.
From the 1995 film GoldenEye onward, the agency is consistently identified as ""MI6"" and is located for the most-part at the recently constructed real-world headquarters of SIS, the SIS Building at Vauxhall Cross in London. In 1999's The World Is Not Enough, its base of operations would temporarily move to a Scottish castle following a terrorist attack on the SIS Building orchestrated by the anarchist Renard. The Secret Service's designation and headquarters would carry over from the Pierce Brosnan era into the 2006 reboot of the James Bond film franchise (despite a peculiar temporary relocation in Quantum of Solace), until the building's destruction at the hands of Raoul Silva in Skyfall (2012) and its demolition in Spectre (2015). Following the events of Skyfall the bulk of MI6 (including M's office) would relocate to Whitehall, with their quartermaster choosing to operate from an underground workshop, accessible via a river-side tunnel beside the Millbank Millennium Pier.
Q Branch (or later in the franchise Q Division) is the fictional research and development division of the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6). The branch is dedicated to developing tools for agents to use on the field.
I branch is the fictional informatics division of the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6). The branch is dedicated to breaking codes and security protocols. It is a regular practice for I Branch to recreate Russian documents solely from the sounds of keystrokes on manual typewriters deep within the Kremlin.

Colombo owns the restraint the pair were dining at and sends his mistress Lisl Baum to follow Bond and sway him to join forces with him instead.
When Bond sets out to find more information on Colombo, by way of Lisl, he is captured by Colombo's men and brought aboard his ship, the Colombina. While in captivity Colombo says he wants he and Bond to be ""friends"" and informs Bond that, in fact, Kristatos is actually the one in charge of the drug smuggling operation and that he is being backed by the Russians.

417,/wiki/Bernin_(Ramon_Tikaram),"Bernin is a fictional small-time gangster and a middle-man who has kidnapped Dr. Malcolm Tedworth and sold his research to Stefan Pomerov. An antagonist voiced by British actor, Ramon Tikaram, he appeared in the 2010 video-game, James Bond 007: Blood Stone.
Bernin is a small gangster and a middle-man who has kidnapped Tedworth and sold his research to Stefan Pomerov.

418,/wiki/Charles_Robinson_(James_Bond),"Charles Robinson is a fictional MI6 aide and Deputy Chief of Staff who appears in the James Bond films Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Die Another Day (2002). He was portrayed by British actor Colin Salmon.
Robinson fulfilled much the same role as Bill Tanner, bringing Bond up to speed on the latest events and the parameters of his mission.
Robinson serves as the intermediary between Bond, the command center (headed by M and Admiral Roebuck) and the support ship HMS Chester as the latter infiltrated a terrorist arms bazaar on the Russian border, part of a joint operation between that country and the United Kingdom. Bond's mission was simply to perform reconnaissance before the Chester launched a cruise missile that would kill ""half the world's terrorists,"" according to Admiral Roebuck.
However, upon the agent's discovery of a pair of SB5 nuclear torpedoes affixed to one of the aircraft being sold at the bazaar, a shocked Roebuck immediately phoned the Chester and ordered them to abort the missile. It was out of range and Bond, hearing this from Robinson, sprang into action to steal the jet and managed to evacuate the torpedoes moments before impact. The command center initially believed, due to the destruction of their cameras in the area by the blast, that he had been unsuccessful. Bond then radioed the center and asked where the admiral would like the armaments delivered.
A short time later after Bond had returned to England, Robinson accompanied him, Moneypenny, and M as the agent was briefed on his next mission: to investigate the actions of media mogul Elliot Carver and his relation to the sinking of the HMS Devonshire, a ship that had been seemingly sunk by Chinese MIGs during a confrontation. As a result of the escalating tensions between England and China from this incident, which in reality had been engineered by Carver utilizing a stealth ship, the two countries seemed prepared to go to war. As Robinson and M observed the fleets of the two countries nearing one another in the South China Sea, Carver's plot was exposed.
Robinson is seen here and there but mainly visible near the end of the film when he, R (who has just become the new Q) and M all notice via satellite footage that Bond is having a rather erotic encounter in a hotel with Christmas Jones.
Robinson appears at the beginning during a realistic training simulation that Bond is participating in and later reappears near the end of the film while working with the NSA and M to help diffuse the growing threats by the main antagonists. Upon the arrival of Bond and Jinx, informs that the North Korean hardliners staged a coup and are preparing to invade South Korea under the leadership of Graves [Colonel Tan-Sun Moon].
Initially Charles Robinson was intended as a replacement for the character of Bill Tanner when Michael Kitchen was unavailable to reprise his role from GoldenEye. However, since his performance in Tomorrow Never Dies, he went on to appear in three consecutive films as a regular. Both characters then appeared in The World Is Not Enough.

"
423,/wiki/GoldenEye_(weapon),"The GoldenEye was a fictional electro-magnetic orbital weapon developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. GoldenEye was subsequently hijacked by the Janus Syndicate from its Russian control facility at Severnaya, Russia and was instrumental in Alec Trevelyan's vengeful plot to decimate Britain's financial economy. The weapon first appeared in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye and also featured in the film's novelisation, 1997 video-game and 2010 re-imagined video-game.
A collection of equipment made up the GoldenEye, each playing an intricate part in the use of the weapon. Firstly, the weapon consisted of two disposable satellites designated ""Petya"" and ""Mischa"", each one armed with a nuclear warhead. By detonating the device in the upper atmosphere, a pulse or a radiation surge, is generated; capable of destroying all electronic devices in a 30 mile radius. Consequently, eliminating all forms of electronic communication or retaliation.
In order to activate the the satellites, three keys were needed; two conventional golden keys were used to start the system's targeting network. The third key, a large rectangular cartridge that housed an optical disc and translucent golden gem, was used to read the system's complex access and firing codes. In order to obtain the three keys, an authorization code was needed to unlock the eye shaped vault where they rested. After the cartridge key was loaded into the console, the golden keys needed to be turned with precise synchronization to activate the targeting system. With the target coordinates set, the weapon needed to be manually armed by entering the firing codes. After unlocking yet another compartment, the system would be ready to fire once the trigger switch was turned.
The GoldenEye was kept locked away by the Russian Defense ministry at a supposedly abandoned radar station at Severnaya, in the middle of northern Russia. Deep beneath the control center however, was the GoldenEye's heavily guarded terminal room. Despite being home to the world's most high-tech weapon, the facility itself was rather crude and obsolete. Due to the secretive nature of the weapons program, the staff at the Severnaya station was minimal; among these employees were Boris Grishenko and Natalya Simonova. The facility and most of it's staff ultimately met their end when General Ourumov and Xenia Onatopp infiltrated the base and stole the keys, detonating the first of the satellites over the complex.
A second station was secretly constructed within the heart of the Cuban jungle, it's existence remained hidden even from the entire body of the Russian Defense Council. The location of the duplicate facility was unbeknown to even the Severnaya staff; the only individuals who knew of it's whereabouts were General Ourumov and his Janus associates. The Cuban Station was far more elaborate than Severnaya, possessing a massive antenna dish that dwarfed it's Siberian counterpart. Inside the facility, there was a state-of-the-art terminal room. Adorning the wall of the control room was an enormous video screen that displayed a coordinate world map, as well as other specs of the GoldenEye's designated target.
In order to avoid detection from spy satellites or the naked eye, the antenna dish was capable of being flooded, effectively disguising itself as a mere lake. Trevelyan also managed to keep the compound heavily guarded with a veritable army of his Janus operatives, constantly having them around the perimeter, concentrated within the terminal room, and even having two helicopter gunships patrol the sky above. Along with Trevelyan's forces, the base itself also had it's own built in defense systems, including hidden missile turrets that were capable of swatting down enemy aircraft. The Cuban facility wound up being destroyed as well, this time by Bond himself as he was able to destroy both the central control terminal and sabotage the radar antenna.
During the course of the film, the weapon is hijacked by the Janus crime syndicate. After infiltrating the Severnaya facility, they massacre the technicians and steal the control disk for the weapon. To cover their tracks, they program one of the GoldenEye satellites (Petya) to destroy the complex with an electromagnetic pulse. With the control key and a duplicate control center in Cuba, Alec Trevelyan planned to steal money from the Bank of England before erasing all of its financial records with the remaining GoldenEye, concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy.
During the final confrontation with Bond, a survivor and programmer from the Severnaya facility, Natalya Simonova, programs the satellite to initiate atmospheric re-entry and destroy itself. Despite Janus employee Boris Grishenko's best efforts to prevent it, the Mischa satellite burns up harmlessly in the Earth's atmosphere during the film's climax.
Nightfire features a multiplayer scenario titled ""GoldenEye Strike"" which involves two teams scrambling to find both the GoldenEye key and disc, in order to fire the EMP on the opposing team and score points.

424,/wiki/Audi_A5,"The Audi A5 is a mid-size coupé, built by German manufacturer Audi, based on their compact executive car, the Audi A4. The car seen in Skyfall belongs to Audi's 'B8' generation, which is the eighth generation of the 80/A4 range, and the first A5 generation. It does not have a direct predecessor, as the last mid-size coupé built by Audi, the Audi Coupé B3 had been discontinued in 1996. The model seen in the movie is the pre-facelift model, as both A4 and A5 received a refurbishment in mid-2011 for the 2012 model year. The model was built until 2016, when the new generation ('B9') was introduced.
The A5 B8 debuted at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show.
The A5 was seen in the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall, where it was used by Patrice as a getaway vehicle in Istanbul. 
Skyfall saw the assassin Patrice leave the crime scene in this car, after shooting several MI6 agents in Istanbul. Eve Moneypenny correctly identifies the car as a 'black Audi', when giving chase with her Land Rover Defender 110 Crew Cab.
However, the Audi A5 with the Turkish licence plate 34 (Istanbul) UE 641 does not last to long, as he rolls over after getting repeatedly rammed by the Land Rover. After having smashed several market stands, the A5 lands back on its wheels, although heavily damaged.
Patrice changes his getaway vehicle afterwards.
Around 15 Audis were destroyed for this short scene, some of them were also seen on 'Top Gear'.

425,/wiki/General_Medrano_(Joaquin_Cosio),"General Luiz Medrano was a fictional exiled Bolivian General and the archenemy of intelligence operative Camille Montes. Portrayed by Mexican actor, Joaquin Cosio, the character acted as the secondary antagonist in the 2008 James Bond film, Quantum of Solace. Medrano also appeared in the film's video game adaptation of the same name, voiced by American actor, Alex Fernandez.
General Medrano was once the military dictator of his home country, Bolivia, but was later overthrown and exiled. He later made a deal with criminal organization Quantum to overthrow the current Bolivian government, and in return, Dominic Greene (through his company Greene Planet) will be given ownership of a seemingly barren piece of Bolivian land for its vast resources. An infamous man, he is ready to plunge his country into drought and famine, condemning many innocent people, to give him a pretext to seize power. Following Mr. White's escape from MI6 custody, Medrano is first seen at Greene's port when he is introduced to Camille Montes, who is secretly working for Bolivian intelligence. It was later revealed that Medrano previously murdered Camille's family when she was young; he murdered her father and raped her mother and sister before burning their house down with Camille inside, though she managed to escape.
As of the plot, Medrano arranges for Colonel Carlos to murder his contact René Mathis and frame James Bond for it so that the Bolivian authorities will catch on to him. In the climax, Medrano attempts to finalize his deal with Quantum at Perla de las Dunas, a hotel in Bolivia's Atacama Desert, for his coup. After signing the paperwork given by Elvis, Medrano is presented with a new contract that will allow Quantum to use Bolivia's sole water utility company to sell at higher rates. Medrano initially refuses to sign this new contract, but Greene silently threatens to have him replaced if he does not comply, daring Medrano to have his right-hand man named Lieutenant Orso shoot him if he wishes to. Unwilling to take his chances in resisting against Greene's orders, Medrano reluctantly signs the contract and receives his share of the money as promised.
Despite getting his share as promised, Medrano is frustrated by this turn of events, so he tries to vent it off by attempting to rape his maid in his suite. However, Bond and Camille lead a full assault in the hotel, killing all of Greene's thugs and Medrano's men in the process. As Bond fights against Greene, Camille kills Orso before making her way to Medrano' suite, where she frees the maid and lets her escape. However, Medrano attacks Camille, gloating of the time when he raped and killed her mother. Medrano then tries to rape Camille, but she fights back and grabs her gun, aiming at the general. Swearing that she will burn, Medrano (with an evil smile) foolishly charges at Camille in an attempt to kill her, but the latter forcibly shoots the hated general in the head, killing him and ending her quest for vengeance. Camille would later escape from the burning hotel with Bond, leaving Medrano's corpse to be buried in the rubble.
Medrano is a completely sadistic, remorseless, perverse and brutal individual, making him the most evil character in Daniel Craig's chronology, topped only by Franz Oberhauser. He has a thirst for power, willing to conspire with Greene to become dictator of Bolivia. He seems to be consider rape as banal, the mother and older sister of Camille being sad examples and he would also raped his maid out of frustration, if Camille hadn't intervened. He's a skilled fighter, as shown with Camille in the hotel.

426,/wiki/Goro_Yoshida,"Goro Yoshida was a fictional Japanese ultranationalist terrorist and Yami Shogun of the Ryujin-kai. A recurring antagonist, the character was first introduced in Raymond Benson's 2001 James Bond continuation novel, Never Dream of Dying, and served as the primary villain of the 2002 book, The Man with the Red Tattoo.
During the mid-to-late 1960s, Yoshida drove Yonai to became the leader in chemical engineering and became increasingly involved in militant nationalism; including a brief stint in the private army of his idol, Yukio Mishima, cut short due to his yakuza connections. In 1970, Mishima committed public seppuku - prompting Goro to form his own private army of nationalists, modelled after Mishima's Shield Society. Eventually Goro Yoshida became the Yami Shogun, the Dark Lord, of the Ryujin-kai and in the 1980s began a systematic global bombing campaign of Western companies dubbed the ""New Offensive"". Now a wanted man like his father before him, Yoshida went into hiding, operating Yonai from afar through a puppet president.
From his secret military base in the disputed Kuril Islands of Russia, Goro Yoshida supplies The Union with a steady supply of trained troops for their various operations. In return for the troops, The Union aids Yoshida in executing his plan of bombing the Cannes film festival in France as an attack on the ""decadence of the west"". Yoshida chooses the film industry as a target because he believes that this will leave the largest impact on ""the west"", who in his opinion value movie stars more than anything.

It first appeared as the titular weapon in Ian Fleming's posthumously published novel, The Man with the Golden Gun. In the novel it is merely a gold-plated .45-calibre revolver. In the film adaptation, the weapon is a custom-built, single-shot pistol assembled from four seemingly innocuous golden objects: a pen, a lighter, a cigarette case and a cufflink. Its popularity led to appearances in most of the James Bond video games.
In Ian Fleming's novel, the golden gun is a gold-plated .45-calibre revolver that carried gold dum-dum bullets with silver jackets. Scaramanga also carried a golden derringer whose bullet was coated with snake venom.
For the film, it was a single-shot weapon that fires a custom-made 4.2-millimeter (.165 calibre) golden (23-carat gold with traces of nickel) dum-dum bullet. Scaramanga used the golden gun in numerous assassinations of officials, political enemies, gangsters, and a 00-agent, Bill Fairbanks (002). Scaramanga later used the golden gun to kill British scientist Gibson and his own employer, Hai Fat. When Scaramanga was killed after losing a gun duel with James Bond, and his island destroyed, the golden gun was presumably also lost.
To evade security, the pistol can be assembled and disassembled into its component parts:
Francisco Scaramanga's weapon, the golden gun, was initially added to the Egyptian level and multiplayer portion of the popular Nintendo 64 video game GoldenEye 007. Due to its popularity it was also added into subsequent James Bond games The World is Not Enough, Agent Under Fire, Nightfire, Everything or Nothing, GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, From Russia with Love, Quantum of Solace, the 2010 remake of GoldenEye 007 and 007 Legends.
In The World is Not Enough for the Nintendo 64, the gun has to be assembled from the pen, lighter, and case before it can be used. In each of the games (except Everything or Nothing and the single player portion of Agent Under Fire), the golden gun would count for an instant kill, which reflects that Scaramanga never missed, although in the games the player can and because of this, the golden gun is not available in single player mode (except Everything or Nothing) but golden versions of the game's standard weapon(s) are usually available (such as a golden Walther PPK, P99 and Desert Eagle).

"
431,/wiki/Bond_Girls,"
A Bond Girl is a character who portrays a significant supporting role or a love interest in a James Bond film, novel or video game. They typically have names that are double entendres, such as ""Pussy Galore"" or ""Plenty O'Toole.""
Bond girls might be victims rescued by Bond, fellow agents or allies, villainesses or members of an enemy organization. Other female characters such as Judi Dench's M, Rosa Klebb, Irma Bunt and Miss Moneypenny are not classified as Bond girls.
The role of a Bond girl is typically a high-profile part that can give a major boost to the career of unestablished actresses, although there have been a number of Bond girls that were well-established prior to gaining their role. For instance, Diana Rigg and Honor Blackman were both Bond girls after becoming major stars for their roles on the television series, The Avengers. Additionally, Halle Berry won an Academy Award in 2002, an award presented to her while in the midst of filming Die Another Day.
Ursula Andress is often considered the first Bond girl, playing Honey Ryder in the film Dr. No (1962). She was, however, preceded by Eunice Gayson who played the character Sylvia Trench. Trench is the only Bond girl to appear as the same character in more than one film, appearing again in From Russia with Love (1963). Initially, Trench was planned to be a regular girlfriend of Bond's in the series, but was subsequently dropped after the encore appearance.
It should be noted that Valerie Mathis was the first ever Bond girl on screen in the 1954 version of Casino Royale. She was played by Linda Christian.
To date, only two Bond girls has captured the heart of James Bond. Tracy di Vicenzo played by Diana Rigg, marries Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). At film's end, Tracy Bond is gunned down by 007's nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld. It was initially planned that her death would actually occur in Diamonds Are Forever (1971), but this idea was dropped during filming of On Her Majesty's Secret Service when current-Bond George Lazenby announced he would step down from the role. The other girl is Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale (2006) who was secretly working for Bond's enemies and shared the same fate.
Within the official series, Maud Adams is the only actress to portray a main character as two different Bond girls in two different films, starting as Andrea Anders in The Man with the Golden Gun in 1974 and again as the title character in Octopussy (1983). She additionally appears as an extra in a third Bond film, A View to a Kill in 1985. Two other girls, Martine Beswick (Thunderball) and Nadja Regin (Goldfinger) also appear in a second adventure, appearing first in From Russia with Love. Tsai Chin appeared in two Bond films as well You Only Live Twice (1967) as a Ling and later as Madam Wu in Casino Royale (2006).
In 1995 Famke Janssen, who portrayed Xenia Onatopp, was considered the only major female character (and villain) whom Bond does not bed. However in 2008, lead Bond Girl Camille Montes also shows a restraint to Bond's usually forward charms.
Becoming more frequent, traditional Bond girls that have romantic trysts with Bond, are later discovered to be villainesses starting with Sophie Marceau's Elektra King in The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Miranda Frost portrayed by Rosamund Pike in Die Another Day (2002).
In late 2014, it was announced that Monica Bellucci will play Lucia Sciarra in Spectre (2015). At age 50, Bellucci made record as the oldest Bond girl in the film series. Previously, Honor Blackman held record, playing Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, aged 39 in 1964. Both actresses play the unlikely role, of being a Bond girl older than James Bond.

In addition to those actresses mentioned above, the Bond films traditionally have groups of women in the background whose general purpose is nothing more than eye candy: they include the sunbathing Miami beauties and Pussy Galore's Flying Circus in Goldfinger, the Thai girls at the kung fu school in The Man With the Golden Gun, Tiger Tananka's bathing beauties in You Only Live Twice, and Sheik Hossein's harem in The Spy Who Loved Me. However, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, A View to a Kill, and The Living Daylights these women were also referred to in the media as full fledge Bond girls to provide added publicity for the film through eye-catching magazine and newspaper appearances.
In On Her Majesty's Secret Service, they include Blofeld's Angels of Death. In Moonraker (1979) this included members of Hugo Drax's ""master race"" and a group of women encountered by Bond in the jungles of Brazil, in For Your Eyes Only (1981) many women were seen frolicking around a villain's pool, while in Octopussy (1983) they served mainly as the title character's servants and guards. In A View to a Kill (1985) they adorned Max Zorin's outdoor reception and in The Living Daylights (1987) they served as decorations at the villain's swimming pool and later Bond overpasses a harem in Tangiers. Although the Bond films haven't stopped making use of feminine ""eye candy"" completely, such large ""Bond girl groups"" have not featured again since The Living Daylights.
Mary Goodnight was a supporting character in several Bond novels before graduating to full Bond girl in The Man with the Golden Gun. The short stories ""Quantum of Solace"", ""The Living Daylights"" and ""The Property of a Lady"" feature female characters in prominent roles, but none of these women interact with Bond in any sort of romantic fashion.

When James Bond gets sent the Kung Fu school of Hai Fat, he finds out the hard way that Chula is one of the best students, if not the best student. After watching a swordfight, Bond is instructed to take centre stage.
After 007 defeats Hassman, the master of the school chooses Chula to fight him next. Chula rises from his seat, next to the master's chair, to the sound of the other pupils, especially the white belts, chanting his name. He and Bond bow to one another, as is traditional in most martial arts, to show respect between opponents. However, after observing that this is how Bond felled Hassman, Chula does not take his eyes off Bond during the bow.
After fighting Bond for a few minutes, it seems apparent that Bond is going to lose the battle. To counter, Bond knocks Chula down and jumps out a window before begins his escape. At once, the students of the school try to capture him, only to fall victim to Hip's nieces. Chula and other senior students, however, avoid this confrontation.
Hip and his nieces drive off, so Bond makes an escape in a boat on the nearby river. Chula and other students follow him, but Bond buys some time by threatening them with the motorised pole on the boat.
After Bond races off, Chula and his crew commandeer another boat and pursue him on the river. Following a lengthy pursuit of the spy on the river, Bond races his boat over that of his pursuers, breaking the pursuers' boat and causing it to sink.
Although their boat is sunk, Chula and his crew all survive; however, their martial arts robes are ruined by the river's water. Their foul luck is observed by none other than J.W. Pepper, who ridicules their supposed dress.

444,/wiki/Albert_R._Broccoli,"Albert Romolo Broccoli (April 5, 1909 – June 27, 1996) known to millions of movie fans as ""Cubby"" Broccoli (a nickname used by a cousin), produced more than forty movies, but will be remembered by most for his contribution to one of the most successful film franchises in history, James Bond.
Broccoli was born into an Italian-American family on Long Island. The family moved to Florida, and on the death of his father Giovanni, Broccoli moved to live with his grandmother in Astoria, Queens in New York City.
In 1940, at the age of 31, Cubby married actress Gloria Blondell (younger sister of Joan Blondell); they later divorced in 1945 without having had children. Having worked many jobs, including casket maker, Broccoli became involved in the film industry. He started at the bottom working as a gofer on the 1941 film The Outlaw. Here he met Howard Hughes, who oversaw production of the movie when director Howard Hawks was fired.
Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in late 1941, Broccoli joined the United States Navy, returning to Hollywood in 1945 to work as an agent at the Famous Artists Agency.
At the beginning of the 1950s, Broccoli moved once more, this time to London. A shrewd businessman, he was able to make good use of the subsidy given by the British government to subsidise films made in the UK with British casts and crews. In 1951, Broccoli married Nedra Clark, who died after giving birth to their daughter, Tina.
In the 1960s, Broccoli met and married actress and novelist, Dana Wilson (née Dana Natol), who died of cancer in 2004 at the age of 82.
In 1962, Broccoli teamed with Harry Saltzman to create the production company, EON Productions and its parent company Danjaq, LLC. Broccoli produced the first Bond movie, Dr. No, that year, and his involvement in the series continued until his death. His family, particularly daughter Barbara Broccoli and stepson Michael G. Wilson, have since produced the James Bond films.
Besides the Bond movies, Broccoli produced the Dick Van Dyke classic Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, from the book by James Bond author Ian Fleming, and the Bob Hope vehicle Call Me Bwana, the only film made by EON Productions outside of the James Bond franchise.
In 1981, he was honored with The Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his work in film and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Broccoli died at his home in Beverly Hills in 1996 at the age of 87 of natural causes and was interred in Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles following a Catholic funeral mass, attended by some of the James Bond movies' cast members, such as Desmond Llewelyn, Maryam d'Abo and Timothy Dalton.

With them all now within his sphere of influence, Kostler entertained them - discerning what they all knew. With the help of his son, he eventually recovered the reel and had his enemies brought to the old Allworld Studios complex at Rustic Canyon, Los Angeles. As the ranks of Kostler's mafia ""private security firm"" swelled, he would hold ""auditions"" for prospective personnel in the old film studio - their dilapidated film sets providing an ample testing ground for new recruits. The unarmed James Bond, Stuart Sloman, the Dartington students, and an investigative journalist named Tori Wo, were to be slaughtered by the gangsters and filmed for Anton's sadistic pleasure. However, with the exception of Sloman, the captives managed to escape with the help of Elmhirst. Pursued by Bond, Kostler attempted to escape aboard his private airship, the Zelda, alongside his son, Barron, Dr. Leaver and a Dartington hostage. Eventually James was captured and Kostler, filming with his Parvo movie camera, encouraged the eager Martyn to gouge out his eyes with a screwdriver. In an attempt to stop the madness, Dr. Leaver ignited the hydrogen gas in the balloon with a pistol, and Kostler, his son, and his associates were caught in the conflagration. Badly burned, Kostler survived the initial fire long enough to pursue Bond, but as the ship hit a forest on the way down, a tree branch speared the mogul through his left eye.

447,/wiki/Barry_Nelson,"Barry Nelson (April 16, 1917 – April 7, 2007) was an American, noted as the first actor to portray Ian Fleming's  secret agent James Bond.
Nelson was born Robert Haakon Nielsen in San Francisco, California, of Norwegian ancestry, the son of Betsy (nee Christophsen) and Trygve Nielsen. (His year of birth has been subject of some debate, but his 1943 Army enlistment record and his 1993 voter registration records certify 1917 as the correct year of his birth.) He began acting in school at the age of fifteen. He graduated from the University of California Berkeley in 1941 and, because of his theatrical efforts in school, was almost immediately signed to a motion picture contract by Metro-Golden-Mayer Studios.
Nelson was an actor of stage and screen. He began working in Hollywood in 1938 and appeared in dozens of movies and TV shows before he was cast as James Bond.
Nelson was the first actor (and the first non European before George Lazenby who was the second) to play James Bond on screen, in a 1954 adaptation of Ian Fleming's novel Casino Royale on the television anthology series Climax!. He preceded Sean Connery's interpretation of Bond in Dr. No by eight years. Reportedly this was considered a pilot for a possible James Bond television series, though it's not known if Nelson intended to continue playing the character. Nelson played James Bond as an American who some characters call ""Jimmy"".

After Climax! Nelson continued to act until the late 1980's. He is best known for appearing in the films The Shining, Airport, and the 1941 film Shadow of the Thin Man.Nelson had two wives, actress Teresa Celli, married in 1951 and later divorced, and Nansilee (""Nansi"") Hoy, to whom he was married until his death. Nelson and his second wife divided their time between homes in New York and France. Until his death, Nelson could be seen publicly at American Civil War shows across America. He was a close friend of tenor Mario Lanza.
According to his widow Nansi, Barry Nelson died on April 7, 2007, while traveling in Bucks County, Pennsylvania nine days before his 90th birthday. The cause of death was not disclosed.

Dowar was present when Raoul Silva attempted to execute M in the courtroom. Upon seeing Silva and his two cohorts armed with guns, she demonstrated quick reflexes for a politician and dived behind the head desk. When Bond used the fire extinguishers to create a smokescreen, she managed to escape the courthouse thanks to the efforts of Eve Moneypenny.

450,/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_159,"The Alfa Romeo 159 is a compact executive car built by Italian manufacturer Alfa Romeo. The car replaced the Alfa Romeo 156, which was built from 1998-2005, and was subsequently replaced by the Alfa Romeo Giulia [952] in 2015. The vehicle was utilised by the criminal organisation Quantum in the 2008 James Bond film, Quantum of Solace.
Quantum of Solace featured an opening car chase, which was filmed around Lake Garda in Italy. Two (in longer versions three) black Alfa Romeo 159 3.2 V6 Ti were used by Quantum henchmen to chase Bond, who had captured Mr. White in the trunk of his Aston Martin DBS V12, similar but equivalent to the one from Casino Royale.
The first car (Italian license plate '21RJ6LT') manages to catch up with Bond in one of the lakeside tunnels. While the driver steps on it, the man on the passenger seat fires a Heckler & Koch G36C assault rifle through the open window, hitting the Aston Martin several times. After exiting the tunnel, the chase was moved to very narrow, and busy roads. When attempting to overtake a truck, the Alfa Romeo crashes head-on into an oncoming Leyland truck.
The second Alfa Romeo (plate '16SA8PT') manages to keep up with Bond longer. The car follows Bond through the quarries. The passenger is armed with an FN Minimi Paratrooper, a machine gun which riddles the Aston Martin even more with bullets. When the Carabinieri, an Italian paramilitary police force, catches up with them, he fires the machine gun through the rear window at the vehicle. The Alfa gets very close to Bond, is even able to ram him from the side. However, Bond uses his Heckler & Koch UMP-9 submachine gun to shoot the Alfa's driver, sending it off the road in the progress.
Although a similar chase scene is seen in the video game adaption, due to not having the permission to use any Alfa Romeo logos, the cars seen in the game resemble more BMW M5 sedans from the E60 generation.

Benson has acknowledged that Playboy cut 1/3 of the story for space reasons.
""Blast from the Past"" is a direct sequel to Fleming's You Only Live Twice and appears to exist outside the timeline of either Benson's or John Gardner's other Bond stories.
Bond receives a message, apparently from James Suzuki, - his son with Kissy Suzuki - asking him to come to New York City on a matter of urgency. When Bond arrives, he finds his son murdered. With the aid of an SIS agent, he learns that James was killed in revenge by Irma Bunt, the onetime companion of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and a woman who Bond assumed had died alongside Blofeld (again in You Only Live Twice).

452,/wiki/Casino_Royale_Strategy_Game,"Taking place prior to the events of Casino Royale, a would-be bomber (presumably Mollaka) is picking up a large sum of money for a terrorist attack at an airport exchange in Madagascar. An MI6 team commander leads seven poker-themed agents (Ace, King, two Queens, two Jacks, and a Joker) against a rival in a quest to find the cash-filled suitcase and/or eliminate the opposition before the enemy eliminates them.
As an MI6 team leader, the player's goal is to find the briefcase of terrorist funds before Le Chiffre's henchmen do, and escape from the airport. The game ends when one team retrieves the briefcase and escapes the airport, disables all members of the opposing team or if someone forfeits the game. The briefcase can be anywhere on the game board and can be seen when within the players' field of vision. They can use the surveillance room to view the location of their opponent's team as well as the briefcase. Once the case has been picked up, an icon that is visible to both participants can be seen above the briefcase carrier. The board will also scroll to the exit. This is their way out. If briefcase carrier is disabled, the case will drop to a nearby square.
Field of vision is represented on the game board as lit squares. Some objects can be seen over or around, while some may hide the player's opponent. Characters can only move to squares within their sight. The player's opponent can be on any square beyond their sight and may appear after completing a move. Opponents become visible briefly when they attack or use special abilities before slipping back out of sight.
Players move their characters by clicking the square they stand on or use the team display below the playing area. Selecting a character will display the character menu with ""Move"" (choose lit square to move to), ""Attack"" (choose lit square to direct your attack) and ""Special"" (choose lit square to direct your special ability) commands. Point cost for a given action is displayed on a lit square. Costs for attacks and special abilities will increase if used multiple times in a single turn. Players start the game with 15 action points and can save up to 20 points per turn. They are given 45 seconds for each turn. When the timer reaches zero or the player's action points for that turn are used up, their turn ends.
Each player has a team of five class characters named after playing cards - Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Joker. Each member of the player's team has unique attacks and abilities. Both the player and their opponent can only sustain so many attacks before health points are fully diminished. Once health has been reduced to zero, the character remains on the board for 3 turns during which it can be healed by their 'Queen' or coerced by an opponent to join the other team. If coerced, opponent gains control of character, but with slightly reduced capabilities.

454,/wiki/Green_(narcotic),"""Green"" refers to fictional narcotic and biological weapon developed by Slaven Kurjak's medical research and development firm, Kurjak Medizin. It appeared in Dynamite Entertainment's first James Bond comic arc, Vargr, which ran between 4th November 2015 and 6th April 2016.
Developed by Kurjak Medizin, Green was a biological weapon disguised as a narcotic substance. The drug essentially functioned as a trojan horse and carried a payload of lethal gene-edited macrophages. Symptoms included coughing, extreme fatigue, and internal/external haemorrhaging. The technology was initially developed as a cancer cure; but instead of selectively engulfing cancer cells, the macrophages ate everything and shredded bodies from the inside. In addition, it spread through the blood leaked and sprayed by the lesions. Wanting to experiment on a grand scale, Slaven Kurjak developed ""Green"" in clandestine laboratories aboard an ex-Norwegian battleship, the HNoMS Vargr, and smuggled the narcotic into the United Kingdom. Production of ""Green"" ceased with the death of Kurjak and the destruction of the ship.

In response to the letter, Fleming had 007's default weapon switched from the Beretta 418 to the Walther PPK in his sixth novel, Dr. No. Boothroyd also suggested 007 attaching a silencer to the weapon that is also used by other characters. This was in response into Fleming's first impression of the suggested weapon being dull and uninteresting. Fleming then created the character Major Boothroyd, who's occupation is stated as an armourer.

458,/wiki/Erich_Kriegler_(John_Wyman),"Erich Kriegler was a fictional KGB operative, a talented East German biathlon champion and the second in-command of Greek smuggler Aris Kristatos who serves as a major antagonist in the 1981 James Bond film, For Your Eyes Only, and its comic adaptation by Marvel Comics. He was portrayed by British actor John Wyman.
Erich Kriegler is first seen in Cortina, going through a biathlon course. James Bond, who is skiing with the niece of Aris Kristatos, Bibi Dahl, is forced by Bibi to watch Kriegler, recognizing the man's athletic and marksmanship when he hits every target instantly. Bibi desperately tries to get Kriegler's attention but he only scowls at her.
When Bond takes his leave from Bibi and plans to ski down the mountain, he is attacked by Kriegler, who has been lying waiting in the forest. Kriegler shoots at Bond but misses, allowing Bond to take cover behind a tree. Though he manages to shoot Bond's gun out of his hand, he fails to ultimately hit Bond and the agent escapes under gunfire. When Bond arrives at the base of the mountain, he watches Kriegler arriving moments later and talking to Emile Locque.
Seeing that Bond arrived as well, Locque and Claus, another henchman, follow the agent, but are unable to attack him as there are too many witnesses. Protected by the masses, Bond enters a crowded elevator which takes him on a ski jump. Though Locque and Claus are in the elevator as well, they still cannot attack. Arriving on top, Bond tries to escape by skiing down, but Claus skis with him as well, only to be knocked down as well. Kriegler, who had been lying waiting at the bottom is disarmed when Bond jumps right over him, knocking the rifle out of his hands. Pursued by two henchmen on motorcycles Bond is eventually able to defeat his pursuers. Kriegler, who follows by motorcycle as well, is eventually knocked out of the saddle. Out of frustration, he lifts his motorcycle and throws it after Bond, but misses the spy by far.
Returning to the ice rink, Bond asks Bibi about Kriegler, finding out that he is defecting from East Germany.
Kriegler is encountered again when Bond obtains the ATAC from the sunken ship. Along with Kristatos, he is present when Bond triggers a alarm, causing Kristatos to send a henchman down there, who is ultimately defeated by Bond. When Bond and Melina get back to the surface, they find that Kristatos and his henchman have taken over their ship. Kriegler then tells Kristatos that he will deliver the ATAC to the KGB and return with the money, but Kristatos states that their deal was that he would turn the ATAC over at a location of his choosing. He tells Kriegler that he will deliver it to the KGB at St. Cyrils, a clifftop monastery. Kriegler accompanies Kristatos to the place, where they wait for the arrival of General Gogol.
While they are waiting, Bond, who had been in a fistfight with a henchman and falls through a window into the room. Kriegler tries to shoot him but Bibi knocks the gun out of his hand, for which he backhands her, knocking her unconscious. Kriegler then fights Bond while Kristatos leaves to deliver the ATAC, eventually ripping a massive stone sink out of the wall to smash Bond with it. Using a candelabra and the sink's enormous weight, Bond pushes Kriegler out of a window, causing the KGB assassin to fall to his death.

459,/wiki/George_Hellebore,"At the age of six, George's father divorced his mother and they moved to Scotland. As a child, George had loved his father's castle, but as he grew, the loneliness and his father's disregard for George's emotional needs left him feeling hollow. Lord Hellebore was so against women and the very idea of not being incredibly and expressly masculine that when describing a dream involving his mother, his father had caned him and screamed that they had no use for women.
While living in Scotland, Randolph had George regularly take pills of his experimental ""SilverFin"" formula in an attempt to make his son stronger and faster, however, at one point George began to refuse to take them, as their side effects made him more aggressive and less intelligent.
After cementing himself as a force to be reckoned with in his first few years at Eton College, he responded to an uproar being caused by his friends, who were harassing new student James Bond and his friend Pritpal Nandra. Nandra and Hellebore's lackeys ran away for fear of being late to class, Hellebore stayed behind to further intimidate James before going on his way. George then made a regular habit of tormenting the boy whenever he could, however, one night, while his father, Lord Randolph Hellebore was at school to discuss the creation of the Hellebore Cup, a new trophy competition, Bond came across them talking with Headmaster Alington. His father, much to George's embarrassment, challenged Bond to an impromptu boxing match before leaving with George and the Headmaster.
After discovering the powerful controlled breathing of schoolmate Leo Butcher during an attempt at suffocating him, Hellebore plotted a trick on Bond.
After finding Bond swimming in the icy Thames, Hellebore forced his head underwater, and would not allow him to leave unless he would race Butcher in the water. George conveniently left out that it was to be an underwater race with no stopping for air until after James had accepted. When James inevitably lost to the equally victimized Butcher, Hellebore forced Bond's head back in the water, but before losing consciousness, Bond pulled George in. At that point, the old boatmaster nicknamed Croaker emerged to see what was going on. Bond lied, and claimed that George had just saved him from drowning. However, as George and his friends walked away, they threw James' Eton top hat into the river.
After the competition began, George was met with immediate success in the shooting portion, making his father ecstatic, however when fellow competitor Andrew Carlton ties his score, his father grows manic and forces the reluctant George to take some SilverFin pills. Unfortunately, during the swimming portion, a joker in the stands sounded an airhorn, resulting in a mass false start. On the second try, George and another swimmer, received another false start by diving before the whistle. Due to his intense nerves at the prospect of losing, George is unfortunately disqualified on his third false start. Lord Randolph managed to keep him in the competition, accounting for the airhorn being out of George's control, and he starts with a ten second handicap instead of being disqualified. George could easily have won without the handicap, but he instead took third place.
With his father pulling some strings, most of the race proctors were replaced with George's friends for the running portion, allowing for him to safely cheat. During a treacherous downhill portion, Hellebore left the trail while the other racers were busy with not tripping and injuring themselves, and took a shortcut to skip a considerable portion of the race. He maintained his massive lead for some time before Bond caught up to him. George then faked having a stitch in his side, allowing Bond a considerable lead before leaving the trail to cut him off. Growing winded, George was furious when he looked behind him to see that Bond was once again gaining on him. He attempted to trip Bond with his leg, but the boy jumped the blow and George instead tripped himself and fell off the track and into a bog. Covered in green mud, he finished the race in third. While James and Carlton were surrounded by friends, all of George's were on the course, and his father refused to look at him, even though he had tried his best. George's tears cut the grime on his face as he went to confront James. He could not have been caught up to unless he had cheated, but Bond, knowing full well that George had cheated, made that impossible.
Two weeks later it was time for him to return to Scotland. He had not spoken to his father since the race, and he was dreading every second leading up to his arrival, and would have preferred if the train had never arrived. Unfortunately, George discovered that James was riding the same train, and he held the boy's head out of the train window before Red Kelly came and, George backed off. While attending a circus in town, George payed two young men to beat down Bond and Kelly, but they were unsuccessful. He later regretted this, as he had at first been happy to see a familiar face in the solidarity life with his father afforded him.
While reflecting on his father and the time he had spent with him, George decided to write his mother. Life with Lord Hellebore, and his incessant pursuit of masculinity had grown grating, and his father's constant abuse lead George to break into his office to find his mother's address among the divorce papers, and wrote her about his daily struggles.
While asleep one night, James Bond sneaked into the Hellebore castle, and Randolph's cruel aid MacSawney came to wake him. He was brought to the basement laboratory, where he reluctantly revealed that he had not been expecting James, nor was he his friend. James asked for his help, but George knew that there was nothing he could do.
Instantly regretting his decision, George resolved that he had had enough of his father, and went to search for Bond's camp, when he found Wilder Lawless in a clearing. He was then immediately tackled from behind by Bond, who pinned him to the ground. George, began to cry and begged the boy to stop, and although he did not intend to let up, Wilder was the one with the gun, and thus made the decisions. They agreed to trust George, who wanted to help them destroy his father's work. He took James to his rowboat that he had taken across the lake, and paddled them to a back entrance to the laboratory. George went inside to disperse the scientists by telling them his father needed them. When the coast was clear, George led James into the vault where the SilverFin serum was kept, and George smashed the vials while James burned the paperwork. They proceeded to smash the eel tanks when MacSawney came in with a shotgun to stop them. George and James hid on top of the mutant pig cages, and George unleashed the beasts on him. The smoke began to cloud the room, and the boys released George's Algar Hellebore, who ran into the lake, before they threw chemicals from the flammables closet.
When they emerged from the laboratory, Dr. Perseus Friend was in utter disbelief, and went into the fire to save his work. Amidst the chaos, the boys were able to escape without trouble, until George's father caught them outside. His father claimed that the SilverFin soldiers would be his sons as soon as one misstep, George, was taken care of. Just before he pulled the trigger, Algar leapt out of the water, and James hugged George's face into his chest to prevent him from seeing what happened next. George was forced to lie to the police, who would never have believed him, in order to spare James the consequences.
George never returned to Eton, and instead moved to Boston to live with his mother.

461,/wiki/AT-420_Sentinel_/_AT-600_Scorpion,"AT-420 Sentinel/AT-600 Scorpion is an advanced rocket launcher that is seen in three James Bond games. The perks of the rocket launchers may vary for each game. 
The Sentinel and the Scorpion are fictional shoulder fired, reloadable, multi-launch rocket systems. The Sentinel can be fired in either unguided or TV-guided modes, while the Scorpion replaces the TV-guided mode with heat-seeking. The Scorpion is also available as a fixed weapon on some multiplayer weapon sets.
Both weapons use the same model. Drake uses one of those models in the last level, when the player vs him.
The M202 FLASH appears in the game as the ""AT-420 Sentinel"", though there are a few inaccuracies. It is incorrectly depicted as firing laser guided missiles. The four shot clip is shown extending from the front of the weapon instead of from the rear, there are no grips or sights, and there is only one hinged cover in the front (there should be a second one in the back to act as a stock).

The AT-420 is seen in various missions. It is just like the Nightfire one, with the difference the aspect and the form is not the same."
462,/wiki/Diamonds_are_Forever_(film),"Diamonds Are Forever is the seventh film in the EON Productions film franchise, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. It was released in 1971. The film stars Sean Connery as James Bond in the actor's sixth and final official film appearance as the spy. Connery would later portray Bond again for the seventh and last time in the unofficial Bond film Never Say Never Again,12 years later in 1983, and lend his voice for the character in the 2005 video game adaptation of From Russia with Love.
In the film, a diamond smuggling investigation leads 007 to Las Vegas, where he uncovers an extortion plot headed by his nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
Relatively little of the original novel survives the adaptation to film, though many characters from the original book, plus the idea of Tiffany being a diamond smuggler, are retained, so it isn't a complete ""rewrite.""
The test subject sits upright, preparing to shoot Bond as he scrambles towards the mud bath. Bond runs towards the mud bath and pulls on a cord which is linked to a huge tank containing more liquefied mud which is directly above the test subject. As the cord is pulled, Bond ducks by the mud bath as a stream of mud is dropped from the tank onto the test subject, who struggles to get out of the mud. He splutters but is unable to escape as the mud suffocates him but just before he sinks under the mud, he grunts. Bond stands up by the mud bath. He pulls his sleeve up and places it in the mud, searching for the test subject. He pulls the head of the submerged corpse above the surface of the mud, but it's still covered in mud. He finds a pistol that produces a jet of water and uses this to wash the mud off the corpse's face. Once it is washed off, he realises the person he killed isn't Blofeld, but a handsome young man. He lets go of the body and lets it sink under the mud, just as Blofeld arrives with two armed guards. Bond overpowers the guards and then manages to tie Blofeld to an operating table which he pushes into a huge lake of steaming mud. ""Welcome to Hell, Blofeld,"" he quips.
Meanwhile, huge quantities of South African diamonds are being stolen but have not been sold on the market. Suspecting that the stones are being stockpiled to depress prices, M orders Bond to assume the identity of a professional diamond smuggler called Peter Franks to infiltrate the smuggling operation and find out who the stockpilers are.
With the help of fellow smuggler Tiffany Case, and amidst the bright lights of Las Vegas, he uncovers a plot by Blofeld (who didn't die in the cave; Bond had killed another duplicate instead) to create a laser satellite capable of destroying any target on Earth. He uses this weapon to selectively destroy nuclear installations in America, Russia, and China, holding the world to ransom in an international auction, with nuclear supremacy going to the highest bidder.
A notable part of the plot of the movie involves Blofeld's use of the industrial properties of a recluse Nevada multimillionaire by the name of Willard Whyte, the character being a thinly veiled version of Howard Hughes.
The film features a very unusual couple of henchmen: Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. There is a strong suggestion that they are involved in more than just a professional relationship; they appear to be homosexual, although the film never explicitly makes that clear. Throughout the film, they use several interesting ways of assassinating their victims, from the use of a scorpion to kill a South African dentist, tying the feet of Plenty O'Toole to a metal plate and drowning her in a swimming pool, and attempting to incinerate James Bond alive in a crematorium furnace.
Also memorable are the female guards placed by Blofeld over Willard Whyte, named Bambi and Thumper.

Unbeknownst to him, on the ship's maiden voyage, Agent 007 of MI6 was also aboard. A flight attendant soon informed him of a man seeking to interview him, but Bruhl cuts it short after the interviewer (Bond) keeps him from making advances on the attendant. By this time, all but Bruhl, the pilot, and three henchmen had been knocked out with tainted drinks and cigarettes, allowing Bruhl and his men to land the dirigible on a South Atlantic island where he held the passengers Ransom to the British government for ten million pounds, and the ship for another ten million. He then discovered Bond's true identity, and keelhauled Bond through shark-infested waters to set an example for what awaited passengers whose ransom was not paid. When this was over, Bruhl demanded that Velvet Lee be brought to him in his room, but Bond, who had escaped the sharks, stopped his attempted rape and left Bruhl bound and gagged outside. He was later found by the ship's pilot, who informed him that Bond, Lee, and the co-pilot were heading to the ship. the pilot was killed in the firefight, but Bruhl was able to sneak aboard. He waited in the galley until Lee came down and he took her hostage. He then demanded that Bond surrender. When Bond came down, he had the co-pilot send the ship into a dive to throw Bruhl off-balance, and After a fistfight, Bond tricked Bruhl into charging at him, which led to him falling to his death from an exit hatch.

Whitaker even has a pantheon of ""great military commanders"" in his headquarters, which included some of history's most famous and infamous figures, such as Adolf Hitler, Napoleon I of France, Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, and Attila the Hun. Whitaker holds these men in high regard and calls them ""surgeons who removed society's dead flesh"". Perhaps the most disturbing thing about this collection is that all representations of these ""surgeons"" are sculpted to resemble Whitaker himself, which is highly noticeable when Whitaker hides among the statues waiting for General Pushkin to visit.
Whitaker hires the help of Soviet General Georgi Koskov to secure a large shipment of opium from the Snow Leopard Brotherhood in Afghanistan for $500,000,000 worth of diamonds that he had obtained from an arms deal with the Soviets. At the same time, they attempt to use James Bond to eliminate the Soviet head of secret operations, General Pushkin, on the basis that he has instituted an ongoing operation called ""Smert Shpionam"" meaning ""Death to Spies."" Actually, it is their men, especially Koskov's henchman Necros, who are involved in killing British secret service agents. After thwarting Whitaker's plans, Bond hunts him down at his Tangier headquarters and kills him after a game of cat-and-mouse in his gaming room, with him using high-tech weapons (such as a light machine gun with an integral ballistic shield), and Bond using his Walther PPK. After Bond hides behind a bust of British commander Wellington, he sets his key-ring finder behind it. Whitaker gets right in front of it, and the key-ring finder explodes, triggered by Bond's wolf whistle. The explosion topples the bust and podium on top of Whitaker, crushing him through a glass display case containing one of his miniature wargaming setups resembling Waterloo. He thus dies on the battlefield after all, Bond ironically quipping, ""He met his Waterloo.""

476,/wiki/Gustav_Graves/Tan_Sun_Moon,"Founder and owner of the Graves CorporationColonel Tan-Sun Moon, later known as Sir Gustav Graves, was a fictional North Korean military colonel who attempted to unite the Korean peninsula under his county's flag. After his presumed death at the hands of James Bond, he changed his appearance to infiltrate the society he intended to destroy; becoming a charismatic diamond magnate.
Portrayed jointly by Korean-American actor, Will Yun Lee, (as Moon) and British actor, Toby Stephens, (as Graves) the character served as the main antagonist of the 2002 James Bond film, Die Another Day. He was also featured in Raymond Benson's accompanying novelisation and was re-imagined for Activision's 2012 James Bond video game, 007 Legends.
Born the son General Moon, Tan-Sun Moon was a Colonel (Sangchwa) in the North Korean People's Army. In a hope that a Western education would help bridge the gap between East and West, General Moon sent his son to study at Oxford and Harvard. It was an experience which would prove formative on the young Moon, providing him with the contacts which he would later use; including Miranda Frost who was on also on the Harvard fencing team. He was able to bring Frost to his side by arranging her to win the Olympic Gold Medal in fencing by implicating her competitor for using steroids. General Moon would later regret the decision, coming to believe that his son had become corrupted by the ideas and greed of the West.
A radical and a dealer in hi-tech weaponry, Moon conducted various illicit operations in diamond  smuggling to fund his private army and ambitions to forcibly unite the two Koreas. He had his base set up in the middle of the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. He also had assistance from a fellow Korean officer named Tang Lin Zao. MI6 becomes aware of his activities, however, and dispatches three agents, including James Bond, to assassinate Moon by intercepting and replacing a diamond smuggler named Van Bierk.
When Zao finds out that Bond is in truth a British spy sent to kill him, Moon uses to destroy the helicopter Bond arrived in with one of his high-tech weapons, called Tankbuster, killing the two remaining agents. Before he can kill Bond too, Moon is told that General Moon is about to arrive at the base. The Colonel and his men then quickly leave the base with the hovercrafts and weapons, so that his father doesn't find out about his weapon dealing. He leaves Bond to be shot by his men but the agent escapes by blowing up the diamond suitcase, having implanted a bomb earlier, and fleeing with the last remaining hovercraft. Pursuing Moon, Bond has to fight off many Korean soldiers while being shot at by Moon with his Tankbuster and a flamethrower.
Eventually jumping onto Moon's hovercraft, Bond attacks the young military and the two fight long enough for the hovercraft to reach a cliff. Without a pilot to steer it the hovercraft drives right over the cliff into the river far below. Bond is able to jump off in time, but Moon is dragged over the cliff and presumed deceased. Right after, Bond is arrested by General Moon and his soldiers, and brought to a North Korean torture camp where he is brutally interrogated for before being exchanged for Zao, who had been arrested by the British.
Unknown to the rest of the world - including his own father - Moon survives the incident and flees to Cuba, where he undergoes DNA replacement therapy (provided by Dr. Alvarez) to alter his appearance to make him appear to be of European descent. Emerging from the therapy, he completed his transformation and adopted the name Gustav Graves.
Gustav Graves was seen as a sophisticated, sarcastic, rude and arrogant business man. In a conversation with Bond later in the film, he admits that he modelled this new identity after him. He portrays himself to the world as an ecologist, fencing champion and adrenaline junkie, with a penchant for speed—activities which he has plenty of time for, given that the gene therapy has robbed him of the ability to sleep.
His official story was that he was an orphan who worked in diamond mines in Argentina; from there, he learned engineering and founded the Graves Corporation. He discovered a great mine of diamonds in Iceland and made a huge fortune. With that fortune, Graves developed Icarus - a satellite which harnesses solar energy and focuses it, ""gently"", over the Earth, supposedly putting an end to famine and poverty. In reality, his fortune was made using a fake diamond mine as a front for laundering African conflict diamonds and his Icarus satellite is a super-weapon. The main purpose of Icarus was to blast its way through the heavily-fortified demilitarized zone, providing a pathway for the invading North Korean forces and bringing about Korean unification.
Brought on Graves' trace through blood diamonds he found with Zao, Bond - unaware of Graves' true identity - travels to London, where he witnesses Graves arriving at the Buckingham Palace by parachute before he is knighted by the Queen. Later that day, Bond visits the fencing academy where Graves is training and manages to persuade the fight trainer Verity to arrange a match with Graves. When being introduced to Graves, the villain asks whether they have met before, to which Bond responds by stating he would remember. Graves admits that he is mistaking. Driven by their arrogance, both men then engage in their training match, betting money on the outcome. When Graves asks Bond if he still wants to continue, Bond proposes to up the wager, showing him one of the blood diamonds he got from Zao.
When continuing their fight, Bond cuts Graves at the hand, pausing their fight to continue. When Bond mockingly-affably asks Graves whether he wants to continue, Graves responds that of course he wants to ""bloody continue"", but proposes that they use real swords and fight till first blood drawn from the torso. They engage in a furious duel, where both men are cut multiple times. Fighting their way through the club, changing their weapons multiple times. Eventually hammering at each others with medieval claymores, they continue their fight in the outer parts of the club, with Bond finally cutting Graves at the stomach, thereby throwing him into a fountain. Graves emerges furiously but before he can continue the fight, Miranda Frost stops them. Graves laughs and admits that Bond beat him and the men shake hands. Before they leave, Graves, as a token of good sportsmanship, invites Bond to his Icarus demonstration in Iceland at the next weekend.
When Bond arrives at Graves' Ice Palace at Iceland, a palace made from pure ice only built for the demonstration of Icarus, he is greeted by Graves and his security head Mr. Kil. While the guests entertain themselves inside, Graves is using his dream machine. He is interrupted by a man who is revealed to be Zao. Seeing his old friend for the first time after Zao's departure, Graves looks at his unfinished face and asks him who did that. Zao responds that it is Bond's work and Graves gleefully tells him that he has met Bond and Bond did not recognize him at all. Graves then asks Zao of news of his father and Zao tells him that General Moon still mourns his death.
The guests are then called for the presentation. Graves then presents Icarus, telling them that it will be used to bring light to the darkest places on earth and is able to warm even the coldest places to grow crops, therefor being a mean to end world hunger. He then uses Icarus to illuminate the entire palace, causing giant applause from the guests.
When NSA agent Jinx, who has also reached Island, breaks into the complex where Graves' chambers are located to kill Graves, she expects to find him under the dream machine's mask. However, when she takes the mask off, Zao looks at her and Graves attacks her from behind, wearing the prototype of his Icarus suit.
After saving Jinx from Zao, Bond heads to Graves' office where he waits for his old enemy. When Graves arrives, Bond tells him that he knows his true identity, based on Zao's presence and the lack of alternative explanations for the dream machine's presence. Graves mocks him, telling him he thought that Bond would never get it. He then reveals to Bond that while they only met briefly, Bond had made a lasting impression on him, causing him to model his new identity Gustav Graves after the MI6 agent. Miranda then arrives, holding her weapon at Graves. Graves remarks seemingly defeated that Miranda seems to be not the one she claims to be. Bond agrees, but then Graves asks whether he has found out who betrayed him in North Korea and if it never occurred to him to look inside MI6. Miranda then aims her gun at Bond, revealing herself as the traitor. Graves also reveals that he knows of Jinx and says that a tragedy will befall her soon.
When Bond is about to be killed, Bond goads Zao into hitting him into stomach in order to allow him to fall to the ground. Using a special ring he got from MI6's quartermaster, he breaks the glass panel that covers the entire floor in order to fall into the lower floor. As Bond runs off, Graves orders Zao to follow and kill him but Bond escapes with Graves' speeder, driving off into the ice plains at insane speed. When Zao returns and tells Graves that Bond escaped, Graves decides to unleash Icarus.
He orders Zao to bring the three North Korean generals (Dong, Li & Han) that were underneath the guests and tells them that he will demonstrate them the full power of Icarus. He then has Icarus produce a gargantuan heat beam, which Bond can only escape because of his vehicle's enormous speed. When Bond drives off a cliff, hanging there only on the breaking hook of the speeder, Graves has Icarus cut off the entire cliff. Though Bond survives, Graves believes him to be dead.
Preparing to return to North Korea, Graves leaves Zao at the palace to oversee the final preparations. He, Miranda and most of his men then leave the palace, leaving Zao only with a minimal force. Returning to the palace for Jinx, Bond sees their escape plane arrive. On the plane, Graves uses Icarus to destroy his ice palace, destroying any evidence left. After this, he tells his engineer Vlad to complete the Icarus suit.
Having fled to a North Korean airbase, Graves plans to use Icarus to destroy the minefield in the demilitarized zone, allowing North Korean forces to attack the South. As General Moon wouldn't allow this war, the hardliners staged a coup and put the general under arrest. Bond and Jinx are sent to stop Graves.When the USA sends a missile to destroy Icarus, Graves uses the satellite's power to disintegrate it mid-air.
Unable to assassinate Graves at the airbase, Jinx and Bond are forced to board Graves' plane. On-board the plane, Graves and the generals are inside a planning room, where Graves admires the finished Icarus suit. He tells his men to have his father brought down. When General Moon arrives, Graves addresses him, but as his face is changed General Moon does not recognize him. When Moon tells him that he does not now him, Graves says that Moon always found it difficult to accept him, which made his exile easier to bear. He then quotes his father, which makes Moon realises that the man next to him is his son. However, he is deeply shocked, asking what his son did to himself. Graves then tells his father to watch the rising of his son and activates Icarus to destroy the minefield. However, opposed to Graves, Moon is disgusted by the heat beam as he knows this would mean war, with the Americans presumably sending nuclear warheads.
Finally realizing what his son has become, Moon grabs a gun from General Han and points it at his son's head. Graves asks his father whether he would kill his own son. When Moon claims that his son died long ago, Graves disarms him with the electricity glove of his Icarus suit and shoots him. He then sees Bond walking towards him and about to shoot him, but a henchman intervenes and the bullet hits the plane's window instead, causing it to break, sucking out everyone except Bond and Graves.
Graves and Bond then fight in the remains of the room, with Graves eventually overpowers Bond with his shock glove, Graves takes the plane's two parachutes and throws one out of the window. Intending to leave Bond to die in the plane crash, Graves kneels down next to Bond for one last gloat.
As he leans over the fallen spy to gloat, 007 reaches out and yanks the parachute's release cord; causing Graves to be pulled through a hole in the fuselage. As Moon desperately clings onto the edge of the chassis, Bond reaches out and activates the suit's electric defenses causing Moon to shock himself. He loses his grip and is sucked - along with the controls for the Icarus - into the Autonov's jet engine. With the destruction of his suit, Icarus is rendered harmless.
Gustav Graves also appears in 007 Legends in the Die Another Day mission. He has the likeness of is and voiced by Toby Stephens, but no reference is made to his past as Colonel Moon, implying that he was born Gustav Graves. The only exception to this theory is that a bust of Colonel Moon's head can be seen on Graves's cargo plane. Although he is shown wearing his North Korean uniform underneath his armor, his collar cuffs are absent.
While an original character, the character of Gustav Graves incorporates a number of elements from Ian Fleming's original novel Moonraker. In that novel, a Nazi adopts a new identity and becomes a popular British multi-millionaire. He then donates millions to create a ""Moonraker"" missile which is supposed to be for Britain's protection but is actually meant to destroy London. In addition, the club called Blades, a fencing club in this film, was featured as a gentleman's club in Moonraker. The name Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is a homage to the first official James Bond novel written after Ian Fleming's death, Colonel Sun by Robert Markham (Kingsley Amis).

484,/wiki/AK-47,"Introduced into the James Bond film series with the 1983 film Octopussy, various Kalashnikov-style rifles have subsequently appeared in The Living Daylights (1987), GoldenEye (1995), and Die Another Day (2002). Often renamed for copyright reasons, the Kalashnikov series of rifles has been represented in the majority of James Bond video games, including GoldenEye 007 (1997), Tomorrow Never Dies (1999), The World Is Not Enough (2000), Everything or Nothing (2004), GoldenEye 007  (2010), and 007 Legends (2012).
In the 1983 film Octopussy, weapons presumably intended to represent generic Soviet Kalashnikov assault rifles of the AK-47 variety are seen in use by rogue General Orlov's Soviet forces and East German border guards. Among the armament depicted as standard Soviet (Warsaw Pact) weaponry in this classic Cold War adventure is the accurately-depicted AKM assault rifle. Hastily seen carried by one soldier just as General Gogol discovers the stolen Soviet treasuries in the salvaged Mercedes-Benz's boot. There's also a scene shown earlier featuring one soldier firing his Kalashnikov modernized assault rifle at 007 in an effort to prevent him from escaping with General Orlov's luxury car (containing the invaluable jewels in the trunk).
Throughout the film, Orlov's men and some border guards use Type 56 rifles, the Chinese-issue AK-47 assault rifle. Besides the obvious ""Russians using Chinese weapons"" issue this is an anachronism since the milled receiver AK-47 was well obsolete by this time for the USSR front-line troops. Orlov's forces are also seen with Adler-Jäger AP-80 carbines, blank firers patterned after the AK-47, while patrolling platforms and railway tunnels near the border. Some border guards also carry these while they're seen investigating the crashed Mercedes' that is being brought up from the river. Czechoslovakian assault rifle designed in the 1950's. Although externally somewha
Many of the Soviet and Czech soldiers, as well as the Mujahideen use milled-receiver AK-47 assault rifles, most likely Chinese Poly Tech Legend copies. Kamran Shah, James Bond and Kara Milovy's Mujahideen ally, wields an AK-47 during the battle with the Soviets. Kara grabs Kamran's AK-47 to go off and help Bond. It is worth noting that the use of AK-derivative by Czechoslovak forces is a mistake as Czechoslovakia was the only Warsaw Pact member that used a standard assault rifle of its own design (Samopal vz. 58). Many of the Bratislava Soviets carry AKMS derivatives. Soviets, Czechs, and Mujahideen also carry AKMS rifles, one of which Bond is able to grab from one of Koskov's Czech soldier on the plane.
The AK-74 and its variants are frequently seen in the Brosnan era of James Bond film franchise (often in the hands of Soviet or North Korean soldiers), most notably in GoldenEye (1995), The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Die Another Day (2002). Bond very frequently uses the AKS-74U, the compact version of the AK-74, by taking them from slain or incapacitated Russian soldiers. He first acquires this weapon during the opening scene at the chemical weapons factory, and then again during the escape from the Soviet archives (he takes this AKS-74U in the T-55 tank with him, and then uses it again when he confronts Trevelyan on his train). Xenia Onatopp also uses an AKS-74U (with two magazines ""jungle-taped"" together). She first uses this weapon to kill all of the technicians at the Severnaya Goldeneye control center, and then is seen carrying it again on Trevelyan's missile train (however, she drops it when the train crashes, and when Trevelyan tries to grab it, he is stopped by Bond, who points his own AKS-74U at him).
Other appearances include The World Is Not Enough, where the Russian military personnel at the Kazakhstan ICBM base are frequently seen using AKS-74Us and in the pre-title sequence of Die Another Day, where the carbine can be seen being carried by Bond and his teammates as they infiltrate North Korea, as well as by some of Col. Moon's men.
The weapons used by the Russian soldiers throughout the movie (and by Bond and Trevelyan during the shootout on the satellite dish) are often referred to as AK-74 or AKS-74 rifles. This is correct in some instances, but wrong in most cases. The vast majority of the so-called ""AK-74s"" used by Russian soldiers in this movie are actually Norinco Type 56 and Type 56-1 rifles, Chinese copies of the AKM and AKMS. The prop weapons used in the movie have been fitted with AK-74-style muzzle brakes and plastic magazines to make them resemble AKS-74s, but the giveaway is the fact that the weapons clearly have under-folding stocks (on the AKS-74, the stock folds to the side), and more curved magazines for 7.62x39mm ammo (the AK-74 magazines are less curved). The weapons are clearly identifiable as Norinco Type 56 and Type 56-1s because they have the distinctive hooded front sights which characterize only Chinese-made Kalashnikov variants.
On a few occasions in the movie, it is possible to spot genuine AK-74 and AKS-74 rifles in the hands of some of the Russian soldiers (see below), usually in non-firing scenes. These are not nearly as common, however, as the mocked-up Chinese Type 56s which are intended to pass for AK-74s.
Likewise, in the opening shootout at the arms bazaar in Tomorrow Never Dies, some of the terrorists are seen shooting at Bond with Norinco Type 56-1 assault rifles with AK-74-style muzzle brakes installed, probably the exact same guns that were used previously in GoldenEye (which had the same armorers as this movie). Several can be seen in Wai Lin's safehouse as well. North Korean soldiers in Die Another Day can be frequently seen using Norinco Type 56-1 rifles at the beginning of the film, likely standing in for AKMS rifles. Some are fitted with AK-74-style muzzle brakes and side-folding stocks, intended to pass for the AKS-74 (similar to GoldenEye).
Appears simply as ""Assault Rifle"" and carries 30 rounds in a magazine. It is sometimes powerful and sometimes weak, differing in every level.
A variant of the AK-47, the AKS-47, appears in the game The World Is Not Enough, with the folding stock removed. Renamed the ""Soviet KA-57"", it shares ammo with all other 7.62mm rifles.
A variant of the AK-47, the AKM (M for ""modernized"" or ""upgraded""; in Russian: Автомат Калашникова Модернизированный), appears in 2004's Everything or Nothing. Called the ""AK-74"", the AKM is (muzzle brake removed) is the second most powerful rifle in the game. It has a faster rate of fire and can bring down enemies with one shot (depending one where you hit), but has a smaller magazine than the SIG SG 552.
An AKS-74U makes an appearance in this game during the Madagascar and Barge stages. Called the FRWL in the game after the film From Russia With Love.
The AKM variant would later reappear in the 2010 video game remake of the original GoldenEye. Russian infantry in many levels carry AKMs, incorrectly labelled as ""AK-47s,"" sometimes with a Trijicon RX01 reflex sight attached. In the Wii version, this scope is incorrectly shown attached directly to the top of the receiver cover instead of mounted via the bracket on the side of the receiver. In Reloaded it is still mounted incorrectly, since it is shown attached with an MP5-style scope mount attached to a random part of the receiver. The AKM is fitted with a smooth AK-47 type handguard rather than the ""palm swell"" AKM handguard.
The ""AK-47"" has a 30-round magazine with a maximum of 240 rounds carriable. In the Wii version it has semi and fully automatic fire modes, while it is auto only in Reloaded. In both games, it is a weak assault rifle with poor range and accuracy. It appears in the single player levels frequently, sometimes bearing a reflex sight or a laser sight. It can be fitted with a reflex sight, a grenadier, a laser sight, or a thermal scope in the online mode. It is unlocked at rank 3 in the Wii version's online mode, while a player starts off with the AK in Reloaded's online play at rank 1. The AK is also seen in the hands of the hero, Ourumov, in the online game mode ""Heroes"". It is much more powerful in the hands of Ourumov, has infinite ammo, and is attached with a grenadier bearing two grenades.
Developed by the same team behind 2010's GoldenEye remake, a revamped version of the AKM model from GoldenEye Reloaded appeared in the 2012 video game 007 Legends during its third level based on Licence to Kill, once again labelled an ""AK-47"". Instead of the incorrect MP5-style scope mount it has an AK-style bracket mounting a rail. As before, the AKM is fitted with a smooth AK-47 type hand-guard rather than the ""palm swell"" AKM hand-guard. As in GoldenEye, the ""AK-47"" has a 30-round magazine with a maximum of 240 rounds carriable.

Straight-line performance was the best of the day, with acceleration from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 5.3 seconds, one-tenth of a second quicker than the Ferrari Daytona. Notably, it was featured in the 1987 film The Living Daylights and the Craig era in the 2020 film No Time To Die. 
The first series had 375 hp (280 kW), and series specific details such as a blanked bonnet vent and a separate rear spoiler. 38 of these were built (plus 13 ""Cosmetics"" for the US). The Oscar India (for October 1, the date of introduction) version, introduced in late 1978, featured an integrated tea-tray spoiler and smoother bonnet bulge. Inside, a black leather-covered dash replaced the previous walnut. The wooden dashboard did find its way back into the Vantage during the eighties, giving a more luxurious appearance. The Oscar India version also received a slight increase in power, to 390 hp (291 kW). This line was produced, with some running changes, until 1989. From 1986 the engine had 405 hp (302 kW).
The Vantage name had previously been used on a number of high-performance versions of Aston Martin cars, but this was a separate model. Although based on the Aston Martin V8, numerous detail changes added up to a unique driving experience. One of the most noticeable features was the closed-off hood bulge rather than the open scoop found on the normal V8. The grille area was also closed off, with twin driving lights inserted and a spoiler added to the bootlid.
The 1986–1989 580X was a performance package, with bigger carburetors and Nimrod racing-type heads, the same 437 hp (326 kW) V8 as fitted to the limited-edition V8 Zagato. 16-inch (406-mm) wheels were also now fitted. If this wasn't enough, a 450 hp (336 kW) 6.3 litre version was also available from Aston Martin, and independents offered a 7 litre version.
304 Series 2 coupés were built, and 192 Volantes (in spite of only having been officially introduced in 1986, near the end of production). Of the Cosmetic Vantage (for the US), 14 Series 2 coupés and 56 Volantes were built. Cosmetic Vantages were built for the United States market – they lacked the powerful Vantage engine but retained the Vantage name, and the look was changed with a flattened hood. From 1980 they featured DOT-approved 5 mph (8 km/h) safety bumpers front and rear. Most of these cars have since been retrofitted with full power, European spec engines.
Alongside the Vantage saloon, ‘Britain’s first supercar’ could be had as a steroid-enhanced convertible. It came with the same luxuries as the ‘ordinary’ Volante, but also trumpeted the 5.3-litre Vantage-spec engine. The USA was desperate for a new high-performance drophead coupé – Aston hadn’t built one since 1970 – so this breeze machine was keenly received there. That’s where the vast majority ended up, making them a rare sight in Europe and their homeland...although James Bond managed to get hold of one for 1987’s The Living Daylights.
The film reunites Bond with British car maker Aston Martin. Following Bond's use of the Aston Martin DBS in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the filmmakers turned to the Lotus Esprit in 1977s The Spy Who Loved Me, which reappeared four years later in For Your Eyes Only. Despite the iconic status of the submersible Lotus however, 007's Aston Martin DB5 was recognised as the most famous of his vehicles. As a consequence, Aston Martin returned with their V8 Vantage. According to special effects supervisor, John Richardson, the decision to use Aston Martin occurred late into production, resulting in problems obtaining vehicles. With an 18 month waiting list for Aston Martin's V8 Vantage Volante, the production team sourced and bought three used Vantages for filming. While one was being outfitted with gadgets, another stunt vehicle began filming the chase scene in Austria.
For The Living Daylights a total of 11 cars were used, though only three of which were real drivable vehicles. One was an unmodified Vantage used for filming scenes with Timothy Dalton, the second was a stunt car and the third was dubbed a ""special effects car"", complete with missiles and rocket booster. Aside from one other vehicle which was little more than a steerable chassis without an engine, the rest were fiberglass mock-ups produced at Pinewood. At the beginning of the film, the car is first introduced as a V8 Volante (convertible). The car used in these scenes was a Volante owned by Aston Martin Lagonda chairman, Victor Gauntlett. To allow for the transition from the Volante to the hardtop saloons used later in the movie, Q-Branch is shown to have fitted Bond's Volante with a hardtop (it has been ""winterised""). Effectively transforming the Volante into a saloon car for the benefit of the audience.
The V8 Vantage Series II returns in the No Time To Die film where the producers brought back Dalton’s car, including the DB5, along with two new Aston Martins like the Valhalla and the DBS Superleggera.
As with previous Q-Branch vehicles, all the Vantage's ""optional extras"" were armed and operated by switches concealed in the center arm rest.

While on patrol in the Norwegian Sea, the British submarine HMS Ranger was immobilized and abducted by Karl Stromberg's submarine-hunting Liparus supertanker. The crew were taken as prisoners on-board the Liparus and the vessel itself was re-crewed by Stromberg's men, designated Stromberg 2 and set sail into the Atlantic. In a big to ignite a nuclear exchange between the superpowers, the vessel's captain was tasked with launching its intercontinental ballistic missiles at Moscow. Meanwhile, the British crew were liberated by James Bond, who takes over the Liparus control center and redirects the two hijacked submarines to inadvertently nuke each-other. The captain and his crew perish in the ensuing cataclysm.

The ship was on routine patrol sailing in the South China Sea when she was remotely meaconed off-course into Chinese-held waters by techno-terrorist Henry Gupta, working for media mogul Elliot Carver. Two Chinese J-17 MiGs were dispatched to investigate the frigate's presence. Unbeknownst to both the fighter pilots and the Devonshire's crew, the frigate was being used in Carver's plot to provoke war between China and the United Kingdom in order to secure broadcasting rights in the former. Carver's Stealth Ship, undetectable by either the Devonshire or the MiGs, launched a sea drill at the frigate, which sank the craft by surgically cutting through its hull. Believing it to be an aerial torpedo fired by the MiGs, Commander Day sent a message to the Admiralty and proceeded to abandon ship. Only seventeen crewmen escaped and they were promptly executed by Carver's men using Chinese weaponry.

495,/wiki/FN_Model_1910,"The FN Model 1910 is a Belgian pistol briefly used by James Bond in the film Dr. No. In the film, after having Miss Taro arrested, Bond returned into her home and set a trap by placing pillows under the covers of a bed, hiding behind the door, and then unholstering his Model 1910 and screwing a ""Brausch silencer with very little reduction in muzzle velocity"" onto it. While waiting, he played patience on the table next to him, also keeping his pistol on the table. When he heard Professor R. J. Dent approaching he grabbed the gun, waiting until after Dent expended all of his rounds firing at the pillows before revealing himself. Bond used the gun to get Dent to drop his weapon and then interrogated him, keeping the pistol pointed in his direction, even as he placed it on his lap to light a cigarette. However, Dent picked up his handgun and tried to shoot Bond, finding it empty. Bond, having already known this, told Dent ""That's a Smith and Wesson, and you've had your six."" and simply shot him once, causing him to fall over, and then put another round into his back (Bond's first human kill in the films). Afterwards, Bond removed the suppressor from his still-smoking gun and blew on it.
It is likely that the Model 1910 was supposed to be Bond's Walther PP (itself standing in for the PPK), used because the prop department was unable to find a suppressor to fit the PP. After shooting Dent, Bond merely twists and yanks the suppressor from the barrel of the pistol. However, the threads on a threaded barrel are far too fine for such a movement. In reality, the suppressor was fake and had a dowel that slid into the barrel for fitting, which is mentioned in the Dr. No Special Edition DVD. Also, as Dent shoots ""Bond"" (the pillows in bed) six times, Bond was originally to also shoot Dent six times, one as Dent is sitting down and then another five into his back. However, censors scaled this back to two total shots, with just one to the back.

Later Bond is attacked by Count Lippe who turns up the power on the traction table in an attempt to kill him. He ultimately is saved by Patricia Fearing (the clinic's nurse, who is the love interest of Bond) when she returns.
After the incident Patricia and Dr. Wain, believe that Bond had accidentally bumped a switch causing the traction table to speed up. 
In the novel, she pleads with Bond to remain silent on Mr. Wain's behalf feeling that it would damage their reputation if the other patients got word of the incident. 
In the film, Patricia was much colder, rejecting Bond's advances until the incident occurs. At that point she leads him to the clinic's steam room and promptly asks him not to complain about it, as she would be fired by her manager. Bond responds that he would remain silent for a price. Fearing then joins Bond in the steam room, where the two undress and embrace.
In the 1983 movie Never Say Never Again, also adopted from the novel Thunderball, there is an unnamed doctor at Shrublands played by British actor Michael Medwin fulfilling the same role as Mr. Wain.

499,/wiki/Connery,"Sir Thomas Sean Connery, CBE Légion d'honneur, (25 August 1930 - 31 October 2020) was an Oscar winning Scottish actor who starred in many films and was best known as the original cinematic James Bond. He also played the Fake James Bond in From Russia with Love.
Connery was known for his trademark Scottish accent and his good looks, repeatedly mentioned as one of the most attractive men alive by magazines even after he was considerably older than more conventional sex symbols. Some consider him more handsome old than when he was younger.
Connery was born in Edinburgh, Scotland at the Royal Maternity Hospital and raised in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland. His parents were a Christian mixed-denomination couple. His father, Joseph Connery, was of Irish-Catholic descent with roots in County Wexford, Ireland; his mother, Euphemia ""Effie"" McLean, was a Protestant. Neither he nor his brother, Neil Niren, were raised as Catholics. Connery claims that he was called by his middle name of Sean long before he became an actor, explaining that he had an Irish friend named Seamus (pronounced Sha-mus), and those who knew them decided to call him by his middle name, which started with an ""S"", whenever he was with Seamus, and it stuck. He joined the Royal Navy after leaving school, and after being discharged on medical grounds went on to a succession of jobs, including truck driver, labourer and lifeguard. He competed for Scotland in the Mr. Universe competition in 1950, which led to work on the stage, TV, and eventually film. As a weight lifter, his nickname was ""Big Tam"".
He has long advocated Scottish independence, and has supported the Scottish National Party (SNP), a political party campaigning for Scottish self-government, financially and through personal appearances. This support is illustrated by a comment from his official website:
Connery used part of the fees from his work as James Bond to establish a charity to support deprived children in Edinburgh as well as Scottish Film production. These charitable works may have earned him a Knighthood earlier, but it was revealed in 1997 that the award had been declined by the UK Labour government due to his support for the SNP.
Connery received the Légion d'honneur in 1991. He received Kennedy Center Honors from the United States in 1999, presented to him by President Bill Clinton. He received a Knighthood on July 5, 2000, wearing a hunting tartan kilt of the MacLean of Duart clan. Connery received the Orden de Manuel Amador Guerrero from Mireya Moscoso, former president of Panama on 11 March 2003, for his talent and versatility as an actor.
He became the second husband of Australian-born actress Diane Cilento from 1962 until 1973, with whom he had a son, Jason. Since 1975, he has been married to French-Moroccan artist Micheline Roquebrune Connery.
In September 2004, media reports indicated that Connery intended to retire after he pulled out of Josiah's Canon, which was to be released in 2005. However, in a December 2004 interview with The Scotsman newspaper from his home in the Bahamas, the then 74-year-old actor denied he was retiring and said he would like to make another movie, but that he is taking a break from acting in order to concentrate on writing his autobiography, but now the book will no longer be written. Just weeks before his 75th birthday, over the weekend of July 30/31 2005, it was widely reported in the broadcast media, and again in The Scotsman [2] which credited the source as an interview in an unspecified New Zealand newspaper, that he had decided to retire from film making following disillusionment with the ""idiots now in Hollywood"" and the turmoil making and box office failure of the 2003 film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.
As a personality he has been accused of being an overbearing bully but has also been praised as a highly professional and polite actor, courteous and supportive of those around him. Connery made a big impression on actors such as Harrison Ford, Kevin Costner and Christopher Lambert, who considered him a great friend during filming.
Sean Connery died on October 31, 2020 in Nassau, The Bahamas in his sleep.
Connery was well known to audiences around the world for his role as James Bond. He first appeared as agent 007 in Dr. No (1962) and subsequently played Bond in several sequels.
Connery was discovered by Harry Saltzman after numerous names as possible contenders for Bond were thrown or ruled out, including Roger Moore, David Niven, Cary Grant, and many others. Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond pays tribute to Connery in his 1963 novel, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and the followup novel You Only Live Twice, by stating that 007's surname as well as his father, was Scottish. Ironically, Fleming reportedly did not like the casting of Connery on the initial grounds that the stocky, 6'2"" Scotsman was too ""unrefined"", but with some tutelage from director Terence Young, Connery won Fleming over. Young helped to smooth Connery's rough-and-tumble edges over (as Connery was from a working-class background, he was subsequently introduced by Young to the lifestyle of upper-class London, so Connery can understand the Bond character from a similar perspective), and then used Connery's imposing physique yet amazingly graceful, cat-like carriage so effectively in every scene. All this payed off and Sean Connery started receiving thousands of fan letters per week after the debut of Dr. No, effectively making him a Sex Symbol overnight. In addition, Fleming was so impressed with Connery's performance he later had James Bond's heratige matching with Connery's canon (see earlier). 
Connery's favorite of the films was From Russia with Love, one of the most critically acclaimed in the series. He confirmed that, in a 2002 interview with Sam Donaldson for ABCNews.com (American Movie Classics erroneously cited Thunderball as Connery's favorite during its recent Bond retrospectives.)
In 1967 Connery quit the role of Bond, having grown tired of the repetitive plots, lack of character development and the general public's demands on him and his privacy (as well as fearing typecasting), which led Albert R. Broccoli to hire George Lazenby to assume the role in the 1969 film On Her Majesty's Secret Service. After the film's release, Lazenby backed out of a seven-film contract. Broccoli lured Connery back to the role with $1.25 million plus 12.5% of the film's profits, or about $6 million total to do so, then the highest salary for any actor. Connery reprised the official role just one last time in 1971 for Diamonds are Forever, then retired from the role shortly after that release.
Due to, and at the height of, an ongoing legal battle between Broccoli's EON Productions and Kevin McClory (co-writer of Thunderball), McClory was allowed to create a remake of Thunderball after a 10-year span after the release of Thunderball. In the late 1970s McClory teamed with Connery to write an original James Bond film. The project never got off the ground due to further lawsuits brought about by United Artists; however, in 1983 Connery teamed with McClory again to play the role of secret agent James Bond 007 for the seventh and final time in the non-EON Productions film and remake Never Say Never Again. The title of the film has long believed to have derived from Connery's comments after the release of Diamonds Are Forever who, after filming it, claimed he would never play James Bond again. (For the legal battle see the controversy of Thunderball)
Connery returned to the role once more in 2005, providing the voice and likeness of James Bond for the video game adaptation of From Russia with Love.
Over 40 years since he first played the role, Connery is still widely regarded as the definitive cinematic incarnation of James Bond, despite credible interpretations of the character by the likes of Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan, and what many believe to be a more authentic literary performance by Timothy Dalton. Connery's own feelings on Bond in interviews has run the gamut from bitter resentment to great fondness. At one point he joked he hated Bond so much that he'd have killed him, but he has also stated that he never hated Bond, he merely wanted to pursue other roles. Certainly, when the James Bond series was at its peak in the mid-1960s, his association with the 007 image was so intense that fine performances in his non-Bond films, such as Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie and Sidney Lumet's The Hill, were being virtually ignored at the time. When asked if he'd ever escape the identification, he replied ""It's with me till I go in the box."" At another point, he stated that he still cared about the future of the character and franchise, having been associated with the icon for too long not to care, and that all Bond films had their good points.
Although his most famous role was that of James Bond, Sean Connery has also maintained a highly successful career since, much more so than the other actors who assumed the role. As part of the agreement to appear in Diamonds are Forever, Connery was given carte blanche to produce two films at United Artists but felt that the only film made under this deal, The Offence, was buried by the studio. Apart from The Man Who Would Be King, most of Connery's successes in the next decade were as part of ensemble casts, in films like Murder on the Orient Express and A Bridge Too Far. After the experience with Never Say Never Again and the following court case Connery became unhappy with the major studios and for two years did not make any films. Following the European production The Name of the Rose Connery's interest in more credible material was revived. His performance as a hard-nosed cop in The Untouchables (1987) earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Subsequent box-office hits such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) and The Hunt for Red October (1990) secured his place as a bankable leading man. He later received a Crystal Globe for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema. In more recent years, Connery's filmography has included its fair share of box office and critical disappointments such as The Avengers (1998), and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), but he also received positive reviews for films including Finding Forrester (2000).
He was planning to star in a $80 million movie about Saladin and the Crusades that would be filmed in Jordan before the death of the producer Moustapha Akkad as a result of the 2005 Amman bombings.

Admiral Roebuck engages in a heated argument with M over firing a cruise missile from the HMS Chester into the Khyber Pass taking out half of the world's terrorists at an arms deal. Although M wishes for James Bond to investigate more an impatient Roebuck telephones the Chester and orders it to fire a missile at the deal. Roebuck then discovers there are two nuclear torpedoes at the deal and the missile he sent is too far to be remote detonated, but the tragedy is diverted when Bond removes them before the missile strikes. Later Roebuck favours war against China after HMS Devonshire sinks at the supposed hands of the Chinese. M however asks the Minister of Defence to give Bond time to investigate.
During the climax, M arrived to inform Roebuck that Bond's message confirms that Elliot Carver has been manipulating the conflict and informs to have his men search for a Stealth Ship though it would not be until after Bond exposes the ship on radar that the Royal Navy has been ordered to attack it.

Xenia snogs him passionately and then Onatopp wraps her legs around his chest and proceeds to crush him to death between her thighs. Farrell's last words are ""Xenia, I can't breathe!"" shortly before he dies from lack of oxygen.

The character was created and developed especially for EON Productions' 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever and was portrayed by actress and singer Lola Larson.
James Bond travels to a luxury mansion in the suburbs of Las Vegas where he believes the millionaire Willard Whyte, hostage to Blofeld, is imprisoned. Entering the house, he is greeted by two athletic women appearing from nowhere. Both appear as Bambi and Thumper and immediately begin to attack Bond using various athletic jumps and kicks. Bond is even choked by Bambi's thighs, but soon gets out from that predicament, only to be thrown into an outdoor pool. Sensing an opportunity to finish Bond off, the two women dive in to the pool and attempt to drown him.
The exhausted and beaten Bond looks to be easy prey for these nimble karate experts and they quickly seize the advantage and hold Bond's head underwater. However, it soon turns out to be a tactical error for the ladies. Transferring the fight to the deep end of the pool, negates their martial arts skills and Bond is quickly able to turn the tables on the girls and holds them both underwater until Felix Leiter and his men show up. Bond continues to hold the ladies underwater for 30 seconds as they thrash about. By now their struggle indicates that they are desperate for air. 
Bond lifts their heads up for a quick breath but then it's right back under immediately while he talks amusedly to Leiter, who complains about Bond wasting time in the pool. The bubbles and struggles of the women underwater indicate that they are near drowning at this point and Bond senses that they might be ready to talk. Bond first releases Thumper, and she desperately uses her last breath to swim to the poolside while Bond continues to hold Bambi under. 
Thumper knows that her partner needs air so she complies by pointing to the shed below where Whyte is being held. Then Bond releases his hold on Bambi, who desperately breathes and swims to the side, humiliated. Bond, heading for Whyte, leaves behind the exhaustedly coughing women who are holding on to the sides of the pool, gasping for air.
What happens to Bambi after that is unknown. However, it is likely that she experienced a very unpleasant fate, wheter arrested or taken back to Blofeld. In this last case, she was probably killed by her boss as a punishment for her failure.
She is named after ""Bambi"", the titular main character and protagonist in the Disney animated classic Bambi (1942).

Bond then introduces Leiter to his masseuse, then tells Dink to say goodbye to him because they are about to share some ""Man talk."" The spy then spanks her as she leaves. Later, when Bond is knocked out by Odd Job and returns to consciousness, he finds a woman's body painted in gold. Horrified, he immediately reports this to Felix by saying ""the girl is dead"".

Soviet ""defector"", Georgi Koskov, informs MI6 that the KGB's old policy of Smert Spionam, meaning ""Death to Spies"", has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin, the new head of the KGB. Koskov is later abducted from the safe-house and assumed to have been taken back to Moscow. Bond is directed by M to track down Pushkin in Tangier, Morocco, and kill him in order to forestall further killings of agents and escalation of tensions between the Soviet Union and the West. Although James Bond's prior knowledge of Pushkin initially leads him to doubt Koskov's claims, he agrees to carry out the mission when he learns that the assassin who killed 004 (as depicted in the pre-title sequence) left a note bearing the same message, ""Smert Spionam.""
Meanwhile, Pushkin meets with arms dealer Brad Whitaker in Tangier, informing him that the KGB is cancelling an arms deal previously arranged between Koskov and Whitaker. Bond, arriving in Tangier, confronts Pushkin in his hotel suite as he got ready to spend time with his mistress, Rubavitch. The Russian General disavows any knowledge of ""Smert Spionam"", stating that the KGB deactivated Smert Spionam decades earlier and reveals that Koskov is evading arrest for embezzlement of government funds. Bond and Pushkin decide to let Koskov progress with his scheme by faking Pushkin's assassination; Bond ""kills"" Pushkin as he speaks to a trade convention in Tangier. Ironically, Bond saves Pushkin; Necros was about to kill Pushkin before Bond appeared and shot him first, which later revealed he wore a Kevlar vest and blood pack to fool Necros, Koskov and Whitaker into thinking he was killed.
Pushkin makes one final appearance after Bond later returns to Tangier to dispatch Whitaker. Following the arms dealer's demise, Pushkin arrives later and saves Bond by shooting Sergeant Stagg. Then, his men bring Koskov out, who is happy he is alive and tried to trick Pushkin into thinking Whitaker held him, but Pushkin arrests Koskov, sending him back to Moscow ""in a diplomatic bag"". After having Koskov taken away, Pushkin apparently helps Bond to clear his love interest Kara Milovy of any wrongdoing, as she had been Koskov's unknowing pawn and has her amnestied.
Originally, the KGB general set up by Koskov was to be General Gogol; however, actor Walter Gotell was too sick to handle the major role, and the character of Leonid Pushkin replaced Gogol, who appears briefly at the end of the film, having transferred to the Soviet diplomatic service. This was Gogol's final appearance in a James Bond film.
Similar to Milos Columbo in For Your Eyes Only, Bond was initially led to believe Pushkin was the enemy, only for him to ultimately be an ally against the real villain.
He was in the first draft of GoldenEye (1995). Just like in The Living Daylights, Pushkin was going to be used as a pawn in the main villain's scheme. His character was replaced with Dmitri Mishkin.

513,/wiki/Goldfinger_(film),"Goldfinger is the third film in the James Bond series and also the third to star Sean Connery as the MI6 agent James Bond. The main cast was rounded out by Gert Fröbe and Honor Blackman. The film was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and was the first of four Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton.
The film is generally regarded as the first official Bond blockbuster as well as being the template for all future Bond films; it is usually credited with triggering what is known as the ""James Bond craze"". The film made cinematic history when it recaptured its production costs in record-setting time, despite a budget equal to that of the two preceding films combined. Goldfinger was also the second Bond film to use a pop star to sing the theme song during the titles, the first being ""From Russia With Love, sung by British pop star Matt Monro. Every other Bond film would include a pop star song, except On Her Majesty's Secret Service. This is also the last Bond film to use the original Bob Simmons Gunbarrel sequence, which was first used in Dr. No.
After a pre-titles ""mini-adventure"" in which James Bond destroys the base of Mexican drug lord Mr. Ramirez, romances with belly dancer Bonita, and defeats a thug in a bathroom brawl, the film proper begins in Miami with Bond foiling the plan of Auric Goldfinger to cheat at gin, when he chats up the girl, Jill Masterson, who is watching the card game through a telescope helping him cheat. Bond and Jill have sex and afterwards, as Bond goes into the kitchen to get some fresh champagne, he is knocked unconscious by Goldfinger's henchman, Oddjob. When Bond comes to, he discovers that Jill has been covered with gold paint and she is dead. Later in London, Bond is told to investigate Goldfinger to discover his means of shipping gold internationally as Goldfinger is under suspicion of illegally smuggling his gold by Colonel Smithers who is in charge of the Bank of England. Bond goes to a golf course where he plays a round of golf with Goldfinger luring him with the prospect of getting a German gold bar from World War II era that Smithers supplied him with. He foils Goldfinger's cheating (although by switching the ball, he was cheating himself), and Goldfinger has to pay Bond. Oddjob at this point shows his ability to throw his hat which cuts the head off a stone statue, then he crushes a golf ball in the palm of his hand.
Bond installs a homing device on Goldfinger's car, and follows him to Switzerland. While there he meets the sister of Jill, Tilly, who tries to shoot Goldfinger with a sniper rifle although she is 'a lousy shot'. Bond is chased around Goldfinger's factory by cars full of Asian men, and Bond using gadgets in his car to lose them, including the famous scene of the passenger side ejector seat, although he is finally brought to a stop by Oddjob's car with its bright yellow beams, and Bond crashes into a brick wall. Tilly tries to escape, and Oddjob kills her with the hat he throws at her.
Bond bluffs his way out of being killed by the laser by pretending to know what 'Operation Grandslam' is that he overheard. He is saved from being lasered, but is shot in the chest by a stun gun, and wakes up on Goldfinger's plane, where Pussy Galore introduces herself. Bond activates a homing device in the heel of his shoe. They are flying to Kentucky, where Bond is taken to Goldfinger's ranch where he races horses. While there, Bond sees the plan of Goldfinger to attack Fort Knox, tries to drop a note off to the CIA by putting it in the pocket of one of the mob members who was going to help Goldfinger, although he ended up being shot by Oddjob and crushed when his car was crushed into a cube. Bond managed to convince Pussy Galore to change the nerve gas canisters in the planes about to attack Fort Knox with dummies, so that it has no effect on the soldiers there. In addition, the army are warned about the attack by Pussy, although this is not revealed until after Goldfinger has broken into the building, where they were all playing dead. But Goldfinger escapes because he is wearing a US uniform disguise under his coat.
Bond is chained to the small atomic device, and is able to free himself when Oddjob throws a guard down several stories next to Bond, and Bond retrieves the key. Bond and Oddjob then battle it out, Bond throws his hat at Oddjob which misses but get stuck in some metal bars. Bond then electrocutes him with a live wire that had been previously severed. Bond prepares to defuse the bomb, and just before he is about to pull some wires, the bomb defuser has arrived, and turns the right switch, disarming the bomb with the clock reading '007' seconds remaining.
Bond then flies off to meet the President, but he finds that Goldfinger has hijacked the plane and is planning to fly to Cuba. After a struggle, Goldfinger fires his gun, breaking the window, and he is sucked out of the plane. Bond quips that he is flying with his golden harp. The plane goes down, but Bond and Pussy escape on parachutes.
With the court case between Kevin McClory and Fleming surrounding Thunderball still in the High Courts, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman turned to Goldfinger as the third Bond film. Goldfinger had what was then considered a large budget of $3 million ($22,480,687 in 2012 dollars), the equivalent of the budgets of Dr. No and From Russia with Love combined, and was the first James Bond film classified as a box-office blockbuster. Goldfinger was chosen with the American cinema market in mind, as the previous films had concentrated on the Caribbean and Europe.
Terence Young, who directed the previous two films, chose to film The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders instead, after a pay dispute that saw him denied a percentage of the film’s profits. Broccoli and Saltzman turned instead to Guy Hamilton to direct; Hamilton, who had turned down directing Dr. No, felt that he needed to make Bond less of a ""superman"" by making the villains seem more powerful. Hamilton knew Fleming, as both were involved during intelligence matters in the Royal Navy during World War II. Goldfinger saw the return of two crew members who were not involved with From Russia with Love: stunt coordinator Bob Simmons and production designer Ken Adam. Both played crucial roles in the development of Goldfinger, with Simmons choreographing the fight sequence between Bond and Oddjob in the vault of Fort Knox, which was not just seen as one of the best Bond fights, but also ""must stand as one of the great cinematic combats"" whilst Adam's efforts on Goldfinger were ""luxuriantly baroque"" and have resulted in the film being called ""one of his finest pieces of work.""
Richard Maibaum, who wrote the previous films, returned to adapt the seventh James Bond novel. Maibaum fixed the novel's heavily criticized plot hole, where Goldfinger actually attempts to empty Fort Knox. In the film, Bond notes it would take twelve days for Goldfinger to steal the gold, before the villain reveals he actually intends to irradiate it with the then topical concept of a Red Chinese atomic bomb. However, Harry Saltzman disliked the first draft, and brought in Paul Dehn to revise it. Hamilton said Dehn ""brought out the British side of things"". Connery disliked his draft, so Maibaum returned. Dehn also suggested the pre-credit sequence to be an action scene with no relevance to the actual plot. Wolf Mankowitz, an un-credited screenwriter on Dr. No, suggested the scene where Oddjob puts his car into a car crusher to dispose of a dead body. Because of the quality of work of Maibaum and Dehn, the script and outline for Goldfinger became the blueprint for future Bond films.
Principal photography on Goldfinger commenced on 20 January 1964 in Miami, Florida, at the Fontainebleau Hotel; the crew was small, consisting only of Hamilton, Broccoli, Adam, and cinematographer Ted Moore. Sean Connery never travelled to Florida to film Goldfinger because he was filming Marnie elsewhere in the US. Miami also served as location to the scenes involving Felix's pursuit of Oddjob. After five days in Florida, production moved to England. The primary location was Pinewood Studios, home to among other sets, a recreation of the Fontainebleau, the South American city of the pre-title sequence, and both Goldfinger's estate and factory. Three places near the studio were used, Black Park for the car chase involving Bond's Aston Martin and Goldfinger's henchmen inside the factory complex, RAF Northolt for the American airports, and Stoke Park Club for the golf club scene. London Southend Airport was used for the scene where Goldfinger flies to Switzerland. Ian Fleming visited the set of Goldfinger in April 1964; he died a few months later in August 1964, shortly before the film's release. The second unit filmed in Kentucky, and these shots were edited into scenes filmed at Pinewood. Principal photography then moved to Switzerland, with the car chase being filmed at the small curves roads near Realp, the exterior of the Pilatus Aircraft factory in Stans serving as Goldfinger's factory, and Tilly Masterson's attempt to snipe Goldfinger being shot in the Furka pass. Filming wrapped on 11 July at Andermatt, after nineteen weeks of shooting. Just three weeks prior to the film's release, Hamilton and a small team, which included Broccoli's stepson and future producer Michael G. Wilson as assistant director, went for last minute shoots in Kentucky. Extra people were hired for post-production issues such as dubbing so the film could be finished in time.
Broccoli earned permission to film in the Fort Knox area with the help of his friend, Lt. Colonel Charles Russhon. To shoot Pussy Galore's Flying Circus gassing the soldiers, the pilots were only allowed to fly above 3000 feet. Hamilton recalled this was ""hopeless"", and they flew at about 500 feet, ""and the military went absolutely ape"". The scenes of people fainting involved the same set of soldiers moving to different locations. For security reasons, the filmmakers were not allowed to film inside the United States Bullion Depository, although exterior photography was permitted. All sets for the interiors of the building were designed and built from scratch at Pinewood Studios. The filmmakers had no clue as to what the interior of the depository looked like, so Ken Adam's imagination provided the idea of gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars. Saltzman disliked the design's resemblance to a prison, but Hamilton liked it enough that it was built. The controller of Fort Knox later sent a letter to Adam and the production team, complimenting them on their imaginative depiction of the vault. United Artists even had irate letters from people wondering ""how could a British film unit be allowed inside Fort Knox?"" Adam recalled, ""In the end I was pleased that I wasn't allowed into Fort Knox, because it allowed me to do whatever I wanted."" Another element which was original was the atomic device, to which Hamilton requested the special effects crew to get inventive instead of realistic. Technician Bert Luxford described the end result as looking like an ""engineering work"", with a spinning engine, a chronometer and other decorative pieces.
Hamilton remarked, ""Before Goldfinger, gadgets were not really a part of Bond's world."" Production designer Ken Adam chose the DB5 because it was the latest version of the Aston Martin (in the novel Bond drove an DB Mk.III), which he considered England's most sophisticated car. The company was initially reluctant, but were finally convinced to a product placement deal. In the script, the car was only armed with smoke screen, but every crew member began suggesting gadgets to install in it: Hamilton conceived the revolving license plate because he had been getting lots of parking tickets, while his stepson suggested the ejector seat (which he saw on television). A gadget near the lights that would drop sharp nails was replaced with an oil dispenser because the producers thought the original could be easily copied by viewers - although this basic idea did eventually get used in Bond's BMW 750iL in Tomorrow Never Dies. Adam and engineer John Stears overhauled the prototype of the Aston Martin DB5 coupe, installing these and other features into a car over six weeks. The scene where the DB5 crashes was filmed twice, with the second take being used in the film. The first take, in which the car drives through the fake wall, can be seen in the trailer. Two of the gadgets were not installed in the car: the wheel-destroying spikes, inspired by Ben-Hur's scythed chariots, were entirely made on studio; and the ejector seat used a seat thrown by compressed air, with a dummy sat atop it. Another car without the gadgets was created, which was eventually furnished for publicity purposes. It was reused for Thunderball.
Lasers did not exist in 1959 when the book was written, nor did high-power industrial lasers at the time the film was made, making them a novelty. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a circular saw to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers changed it to a laser to make the film feel more fresh. Hamilton immediately thought of giving the laser a place in the film's story as Goldfinger's weapon of choice. Ken Adam was advised on the laser's design by two Harvard scientists who helped design the water reactor in Dr No. The laser beam itself was an optical effect added in post-production. For close-ups where the flame cuts through metal, technician Bert Luxford heated the metal with a blowtorch from underneath the table Bond was strapped to.
The opening credit sequence was designed by graphic artist Robert Brownjohn, featuring clips of all James Bond films thus far projected on Margaret Nolan's body. Its design was inspired by seeing light projecting on people's bodies as they got up and left a cinema.
Visually, the film uses many golden motifs to parallel the gold's symbolic treatment in the novel. All of Goldfinger's female henchwomen in the film except his private jet's co-pilot (black hair) and stewardess (who is Korean) are red-blonde, or blonde, including Pussy Galore and her Flying Circus crew (both the characters Tilly Masterson and Pussy specifically have black hair in the novel). Goldfinger has a yellow-painted Rolls-Royce, and also sports yellow or golden items or clothing in every film scene, including a golden pistol, when disguised as a colonel. Bond is bound to a solid gold table (as Goldfinger points out to him) before nearly being lasered. Goldfinger's factory henchmen in the film wear yellow sashes, Pussy Galore at one point wears a metallic gold vest, and Pussy's pilots all wear yellow sunburst insignia on their uniforms. ""The color gold seems to persuade every scene, giving it a distinct motif that the other films have lacked"". The concept of the recurring gold theme running through the film was a design aspect conceived and executed by Ken Adam and Art Director Peter Murton.
The model jet used for wide shots of Goldfinger's Lockheed JetStar was refurbished to be used as the presidential plane that crashes at the film's end. Several cars were provided by The Ford Motor Company including a Mustang that Tilly Masterson drives, a Ford Country Squire station wagon used to transport Bond from the airport to the stud ranch, a Ford Thunderbird driven by Felix Leiter, and a Lincoln Continental in which Oddjob kills Solo. The Continental had its engine removed before being placed in a car crusher, and the destroyed car had to be partially cut so the Ford Falcon Ranchero pick-up truck on which it is deposited could support the weight. The actual soundtrack of the car being compacted was deemed unusable; this was later dubbed during post production - sound editor Norman Wanstall used multiple overdubs of beer cans being crushed in a bucket to simulate the sound of the car being crushed, whilst the baling machine itself was replicated by recording the sound of an air compressor that was being used by road workers repairing the parking lot at Pinewood Studios.
Since the release date for the film had been pre-determined and filming had finished close to that date, John Barry received some edits directly from the cutting room floor, rather than as a finished edit, and scored some sequences from the rough, initial prints. Barry described his work in Goldfinger as a favourite of his, saying it was ""the first time I had complete control, writing the score and the song"". The musical tracks, in keeping with the film's theme of gold and metal, make heavy use of brass, and also metallic chimes. The film's score is described as ""brassy and raunchy"" with ""a sassy sexiness to it"".
Goldfinger is said to have started the tradition of Bond theme songs being from the pop genre or using popular artists, although this had already been done with Matt Monro singing the title song of From Russia with Love. Shirley Bassey sang the theme song ""Goldfinger"", and she would go on to sing the theme songs for two other Bond films, Diamonds Are Forever and Moonraker. The song was composed by John Barry, with lyrics by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse that were described in one contemporary newspaper as ""puerile"". Newley himself recorded the early versions, which were even considered for inclusion in the film. The soundtrack album topped the Billboard 200 chart, and reached the 14th place in the UK Albums Chart. The single for ""Goldfinger"" was also successful, going 8th at the Billboard Hot 100, and 21st in the UK charts.
Although James Bond films are not known for their technical accuracy, but rather for outlandishly plausible action, one incident in this film bears mentioning.
In one scene, the villain's girlfriend, Jill Masterson, is murdered by ""skin suffocation."" She was painted with gold paint and died, because her skin was unable to breathe. According to urban legend, the concept was based on the death of Swiss fashion model who painted herself and asphyxiated.
Though this is a plausible explanation for this unusual method of killing, it has been argued whether or not it is possible. Humans, being mammals, achieve respiration via their mouths and nostrils to fill their lungs with air. The only animals that breathe through their skin are insects and worms. In fact, were it true that people breathe, in auxiliary fashion, through their skin, it would, therefore, be impossible for people to engage in extended bathing, mud baths, scuba diving and, indeed, body painting - activities requiring extended covering of the skin. If one did try murder via gilding, the victim would die of heat stroke, but only after a long period and not in the manner shown in the movie. The gold paint would clog the pores and prevent perspiration, rendering the body unable to properly regulate its temperature. Dying in this fashion, however, would take several days and is a very inefficient manner of killing.
The Discovery Channel series, MythBusters has twice attempted to prove or disprove whether skin suffocation due to paint was possible. In both experiments one of the hosts of the series was covered head-to-toe in gold paint. The first experiment was called off when the subject began experiencing breathing and blood pressure problems. In a follow-up experiment, a different subject was covered but this time showed no ill effects.

516,/wiki/Drax%27s_Space_Station,"Drax's space station was a fictional clandestine space station constructed by Drax Industries. Billionaire industrialist Hugo Drax planned to use the station as a space colony for his 'master race', while annihilating the remainder of Earth's population with a deadly nerve toxin. Once the toxic contamination had cleared, Drax's 'perfect physical specimens' would return to Earth and repopulate the planet. The station first appeared in the 1979 James Bond film, Moonraker, and its accompanying novelization. It was subsequently re-imagined for a 1985 talking storybook adaptation of the movie and Activision's 2012 video-game, 007 Legends.
In 1985, the space station was re-imagined for a children's talking storybook adaptation of 1979's Moonraker, published in North America by Kid Stuff Records & Tapes. As in the film, Bond pursues Drax to his orbiting station; which, though similar to its cinematic design, has a much larger spherical module at its center and is described by Bond as being ""as big as a moon"". After 007 overpowers Drax and ejects him into space, he then sets about destroying the station's radar jamming equipment with the villain's laser pistol. Unlike the film, the station appears to survive intact. Several hours later, Bond watches from a porthole as the U.S. marines taking the fleeing Drax crew into custody.
Over thirty years later, the space station made a second appearance in the Moonraker-inspired levels of the 2012 video-game 007 Legends. Unlike its film counterpart, the space station is more heavily armed and has a more futuristic and symmetrical design. Roughly following the plot of the 1979 film, James Bond and Holly Goodhead infiltrate Drax's space station and sabotage the toxin-probe launch system. As with the film, the marines are sent to investigate and Drax attempts to destroy their shuttles with the station's numerous laser canons. After some subtle coaxing from 007, Jaws switches sides and the three shut down the colony's artificial gravity and assist the marines in destroying the station.

An example is in, You Only Live Twice, where Bond is seen making love to a woman named Ling in Hong Kong while on a mission investigating missing space shuttles. He is onboard a stealth ship off the coast of China in, Tomorrow Never Dies, and also in that film is parachute dropped into the ocean, which is believed to be Chinese, but ends up being Vietnamese waters. He also appears at a US airforce base in the South China Sea in that film. In, The Man with The Golden Gun,  the finale is on an island off the coast of China, where Bond and the film's titular villain Francisco Scaramanga duel to the death. In multiple films, he also spends plenty of time in Hong Kong and Macau, which are parts of The People's Republic of China. In the film, Die Another Day, Bond is back on a mission in Hong Kong. In the film, Skyfall Bond also manages to enter Shanghai and travel back to Macau on a mission sent by M. Although not shown in the film, Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond actually has the ability to read and write basic Mandarin Chinese. It is also mentioned that Raoul Silva was tortured in Hong Kong.

A region named Germania, inhabited by several Germanic peoples, was documented before AD 100. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, which lasted until 1806. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation while southern and western parts remained dominated by Roman Catholic denominations. The different German states became first unified in 1871, with the inception of the German Empire. After the German revolution and the subsequent military surrender in World War 1, the Weimar Republic was proclaimed in 1918, followed by the Third Reich led by the austrian totalitarian fascist Adolf Hitler in 1933. The latter period was marked by a dictatorship and the initiation of World War II. After Hitler's tyrranical reign ended in 1945, Germany was divided by allied occupation, and evolved into two states, East Germany and West Germany. In 1990 Germany was reunified.
Germany was a founding member of the European Community in 1957, which became the EU in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area and since 1999 a member of the eurozone. Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G8, the G20, the OECD and the Council of Europe, and took a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011–2012 term.
It has the world's fourth largest economy by nominal GDP and the fifth largest by purchasing power parity. It is the second largest exporter and third largest importer of goods. In absolute terms, Germany spends the third biggest annual development aid budget in the world, while its military expenditure ranks seventh. The country has developed a very high standard of living and a comprehensive system of social security. Germany has been the home of many influential scientists and inventors, and is known for its cultural and political history.

522,/wiki/GoldenEye_007,"The topic of this page has a wiki of its own:  GoldenEye Wiki.
GoldenEye 007 is a 1997 first-person shooter video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The game is based on the 1995 film GoldenEye.
The game has received overwhelmingly positive reviews and often listed as one of the best games for the Nintendo 64 and sold over eight million copies. It is considered an important title in the development of first person shooters, and has become particularly well-known for the quality of its multiplayer deathmatch mode, as well as its incorporation of stealth and varied objectives into its single-player missions.
GoldenEye 007 was originally announced for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System before being stepped up to the Nintendo 64. The intention for the first few months of development was for the game to be an on-rails shooter; it only became a first-person shooter later in development. The development team working on GoldenEye 007 was inexperienced; for all but two of them, the project was their first game.
The game is based upon the GoldenEye film and its novelization by John Gardner, but, as game designer Martin Hollis explained, many of the missions were extended or modified to allow the player to participate in sequences of which Bond was not originally a part, or those in which he only played a minor role. The original sets that were created for the film were first converted into complete, believable environments by one group of game designers; when this process was complete, other designers began populating them with objectives, characters and obstacles in order to create a balanced and fun game. According to Martin Hollis, ""many of the levels in the game have a realistic and non-linear feel. There are rooms with no direct relevance to the level. There are multiple routes across the level."" Hollis also noted that the concept of several varied objectives within each level was inspired by the multiple tasks in each stage of Super Mario 64.
GoldenEye was developed through two and a half years, but, according to Martin Hollis, only the last year was spent developing the game. During the beginning, the engine was built, art assets were made, and the enemy AI was written and polished. The game was delayed numerous times, partly because during development, the team decided to incorporate a multiplayer feature to the game to demonstrate the N64's 4-player capabilities. In addition to the N64 game, a version of GoldenEye was in development for the Nintendo Virtual Boy, but was canceled before release.
GoldenEye 007's menu system is presented as an MI6 dossier. Four save files are available to track the player's progress through the game's twenty missions, each of which may be played on either ""Agent,"" ""Secret Agent,"" or ""00-Agent,"" difficulty settings, with higher difficulties requiring the player to complete additional and more complex objectives. M, Q, and Miss Moneypenny provide background information on the chosen mission and its goals.
Once a mission is completed, the player may either continue progressing through the story or choose to replay a previously completed level. Completing certain missions within particular target times enables the player to unlock bonus cheat options which make various changes to the graphics and gameplay, and upon fully completing the game on the 00-Agent difficulty level, an additional ""007"" setting allows the player to customize the challenge of any mission.
The player's initial weapon in most missions is James Bond's Walther PPK. Most of the game's firearms are modeled on real-life counterparts, while others are based on fictitious devices featured in the Bond films, such as the Golden Gun and Moonraker laser. The weapons vary in characteristics such as rate of fire and type of ammunition used, and inflict different levels of damage depending on which body part they hit. Stealth is an important element of the game: in order to avoid gunfights with multiple opponents, it is advantageous to eliminate soldiers and security cameras before they spot or hear the player. Certain weapons may be powerful enough to shoot through doors and helmets but are very loud, while others incorporate suppressor or zoom lens attachments to aid the player in killing enemies discreetly.
Some gadgets from the James Bond film series are featured in the game and are often used to complete particular mission objectives; for example, 007's in-game watch includes the laser from the GoldenEye film, the remote mine detonator from GoldenEye and Moonraker, and the electromagnet from Live and Let Die.
The multiplayer mode was added late in the development process; Martin Hollis noted that the setting was ""a complete afterthought"". According to David Doak, the majority of the work on the multiplayer mode was done by Steve Ellis, who ""sat in a room with all the code written for a single-player game and turned GoldenEye into a multiplayer game.""
The multiplayer mode features all of the characters in the game, including enemies and civilians. At first, only 8 characters are available, with 25 more becoming available as progress is made through the game. A button code allows players to temporarily unlock another 31 characters, all but two of them likenesses of the programmers. Variations between characters' heights and builds can affect the challenge of shooting them; for example, there is a significant difference between defeating Oddjob, who is oddly short in stature, and Jaws, a giant.
As with the selectable characters, only a few arenas are available at first, with more becoming available as progress is made in the game. There are eleven arenas, not counting levels that can only be accessed with a GameShark, and a ""random"" button that chooses the level randomly. The multiplayer-only arenas are: Temple, Complex, Caves, Library, Basement, and Stack. Several arenas are taken from the single player mode, with alterations such as restrictions on which sections of the map can be used - they are the Facility, Bunker, Archives, Caverns, and Egyptian.
The multiplayer mode features five general scenarios, within which options such as weapon schemes may be altered. Weapon selections in the multiplayer mode are grouped by type, such as pistols, automatics, and explosives. Other selectable weapon schemes focus on weapons not frequently found in the single player mode, such as laser guns, throwing knives, or the one-hit kill Golden Gun. The ""Slappers Only!"" setting removes all projectiles, limiting players to hand-to-hand combat.
Several references to James Bond films exist in GoldenEye 007, the most apparent being the titles of the various multiplayer modes and the Bond Girl names for the game's control schemes. The CCTV tape found in the second Bunker mission features the cover of the VHS release of the GoldenEye film.
Several members of the game's development staff were featured in the game as generic character faces. Bond's double-agent contact ""Dr. Doak"" in the ""Facility"" mission is named after and bears the likeness of David Doak. The ""Klobb"" weapon (originally ""Spyder""), is named after former Nintendo employee Ken Lobb.
Like the movie, GoldenEye 007 starts in Arkhangelsk, USSR during the mid-1980s, where MI6 has uncovered a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond is sent to infiltrate the facility by bungee jumping from the dam, then join his friend and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan in destroying the factory. During the mission, Trevelyan is apparently killed by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond escapes by commandeering an airplane.
The following missions depict 007's investigation of the satellite control station in Severnaya, Russia where Natalya Simonova and Boris Grishenko work, a location he did not visit in the film. Entirely new to the game is the ""Silo"" mission in which Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in Kyrgyzstan, believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as GoldenEye. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated electromagnetic pulse at any Earth target to disable any electrical circuit within range; from its orbit, it would be a threat to any city on earth.
Bond's visit to Monte Carlo and investigation of the frigate La Fayette and the Eurocopter Tiger (referred to as the ""Pirate"" in the game) were featured in the film, but here they are expanded, with Bond rescuing several hostages inside the ship and planting a tracker bug on the helicopter before it is stolen by the Janus crime syndicate. Bond is then sent a second time to Severnaya, but during the mission he is captured and locked up in the bunker's cells along with Natalya Simonova–this meeting takes place much earlier than in the film. The two escape the complex seconds before it is destroyed, on the orders of Ourumov, by the GoldenEye satellite's EMP.
As in the film, Bond next travels to Saint Petersburg, where he arranges with ex-KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky to meet the chief of the Janus organisation. This is revealed to be Alec Trevelyan–his execution by Ourumov in the Arkhangelsk facility was faked. Bond and Natalya escape from Trevelyan, but are arrested by the Russian police and taken to the military archives for interrogation. The player must escape the interrogation room, rescue Natalya and communicate with Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin, who has verified Bond's claim of Ourumov's treachery.
Natalya is captured by General Ourumov, and Bond gives chase (he can use a tank like in the movie, though he has the option not to) through the streets of Saint Petersburg, eventually reaching an arms depot used by Janus — the player must destroy its weaponry stores, then hitch a ride on Trevelyan's Soviet missile train. This section features many departures from the film storyline, where Bond does not reach the depot, and only enters the train after stopping it with the tank. Bond makes his way through the train, killing Ouromov and rescuing Natalya. However, Alec Trevelyan and his ally Xenia Onatopp escape to their secret base in Cuba.
Natalya accompanies Bond to Cuba. Surveying the jungle aerially, their light aircraft is shot down. Unscathed, Bond and Natalya perform a ground search of the area's heavily guarded jungle terrain, but are ambushed by Xenia, who is quickly killed by Bond. Bond sneaks Natalya into the control center to disrupt transmissions to the GoldenEye satellite and force it to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. An original mission shows Bond following the fleeing Trevelyan through a series of flooded caverns, which conceal a Satellite Dish under water. He then arrives at the antenna of the control centre's radio telescope. Trevelyan attempts to re-align it in a final attempt to restore contact with the GoldenEye. Bond destroys machinery vital to controlling the dish and kills Trevelyan in a precarious firefight high above the dish.
Two further missions unrelated to the GoldenEye film were included as bonuses for the completion of the game on higher difficulties. The first, ""Aztec Complex"", is partially based on the James Bond film Moonraker, and is unlocked when the player completes all 18 missions on Secret Agent difficulty. During the mission, Bond is sent to the Aztec complex in Teotihuacán to investigate the Drax Corporation's unlicensed space exploration in which at least one space shuttle was stolen from NASA. Although Hugo Drax was killed by Bond in the movie, it has seemed that his corporation still existed after his death due to remnants and fragments that were still active. MI6 believes their intentions with the shuttle in space are militant in nature and authorizes Bond to reprogram the shuttle's guidance computer so that MI6 can take control of the craft once it reaches orbit. During the mission, Jaws makes a return in an effort to stop Bond from completing his mission. Many of the rooms in the mission were from the movie and included several new features, such as the launch room for the Moonraker shuttle.
The second bonus level, ""Egyptian Temple"", blends elements from the films The Man with the Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, and Live and Let Die. To access this level players must complete all 18 missions on 00 Agent difficulty. Prior to the mission, M informs Bond that a person claiming to be Baron Samedi is in possession of the deceased Francisco Scaramanga's legendary ""Golden Gun"" pistol. Samedi has invited James Bond to the El-Saghira temple in the Valley of the Kings to retrieve it. Knowing it is a trap, M sends Bond regardless to take possession of the Golden Gun and eliminate Baron Samedi. Although the player ""kills"" Samedi three times during the level, he can be seen laughing in an end-of-level cut scene, similar to the ending of Live and Let Die.
GameShark users found several text references to a level called ""Citadel"" in the game. Rare explained its nature, and joked about players' speculation that multiplayer-mode Bond characters could be seen in the single-player game: ""'Citadel' was a very rough test level designed during the early stages of multiplayer mode. It is not in the finished game in any shape or form, and Oddjob and Mayday would not be in it if it was."" It was thought that a few textual references were all that remained of the level. In 2004, GoldenEye 007 fan sites uncovered an unplayable but viewable single-player version of the level (with implemented sky and water textures).
In 2005, the website GoldenEye Forever revealed that it was possible to access a fully playable multiplayer version by linking a GameShark to a computer. The codes to access Citadel in its fullest state totaled nearly 10,000 lines. The test map is largely a mass of shapes and ramps that the players can climb upon, thus giving players many opportunities for sniping and for hiding.
Before GoldenEye 007 was released, Rare had placed a feature in the multiplayer mode of the game, known as the ""All Bonds"" option. This would allow players to choose four of the five actors (at the time of the game) who had portrayed Bond in various films: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan. George Lazenby was not included. However, before the game was released, Rare removed the feature for unexplained reasons. It is assumed that Rare had every intention to release the game with the feature, but was later forced to remove it. In response, Rare said ""Yes, it was the hope of the team that [all Bonds] would be available to play, but for various reasons they weren't.""
In addition, the actors' portraits were at one point used to illustrate the four single-player save file dossiers; this was also removed, with Pierce Brosnan's portrait appearing on all four in the final version.
Not all remnants of the All Bonds feature were completely removed from the GoldenEye software. One major clue was the fact that the portraits of the four Bonds in the selection screen for multiplayer mode were accessible by using a GameShark. Also, various screenshots in the game manual, such as one from the multiplayer selection screen, show traces of the former Bond portraits.
The feature was brought to the attention of many gamers when the gaming magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly published an April issue with what they called the ""All Bonds Cheat"", using some fake screenshots ""to support"" its claim. The magazine reported that to unlock the option in the cheat menu, a player must complete the Aztec mission on 007 difficulty in less than nine minutes with all customisable enemy settings on the highest difficulty. The claim was later found to be an April Fools prank, which the magazine held annually.
In 2005, a program called the GoldenEye ROM Editor was released by The Rare Witch Project. The coders SubDrag and Ice Mario cracked the compression format of the images used by the game, allowing any image in the game's memory to be viewed and edited, by opening up a ROM image of the game. It was then discovered that the All Bonds faces and suits are still in the game; Rare had only removed the ability to use them. By mapping them onto other multiplayer characters' faces and bodies, one can try to recreate All Bonds, although since the body and head shapes do not match the textures, it will not look as it was intended.
When GoldenEye 007 was released in 1997, its stealth elements and varied objectives contrasted with the approaches taken by Doom and Quake, and its split-screen deathmatch mode proved popular. These factors contributed to the game's commercial success, selling eight million copies.
In 1998, GoldenEye received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment ""Games Award"" and Rare won the award for ""Best UK Developer"". It also won four awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences: ""Console Action Game of the Year"", ""Console Game of the Year"", ""Interactive Title of the Year"" and ""Outstanding Achievement in Software Engineering"". Additionally, it was nominated for ""Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics"" and ""Outstanding Achievement in Interactive Design"".
In a January 2000 poll, readers of the long-running British video game magazine Computer and Video Games voted GoldenEye 007 into first place in a list of ""the hundred greatest video games"". In a poll in the next year, the game was ranked 5th. Also in 2001, Game Informer magazine ranked GoldenEye 007 16th in a list of the ""Top 100 Games of All Time"". In 2005, a ""Best Games of All-Time"" poll at GameFAQs placed GoldenEye 007 at 7th. In a list made by IGN in 2005, GoldenEye was ranked 29th while the Reader's Choice placed it at 7th.
The game originally received a ""nine out of ten"" score in Edge, with the magazine later stating that ""a ten was considered, but eventually rejected"". In the magazine's 10th anniversary issue in 2003, the game was included as one of their top ten shooters, along with a note that it was ""the only other game"" that should have received the prestigious ""ten out of ten"" rating.
Video game review site ScrewAttack rated GoldenEye number one on three different Top 10 lists, winning the title of ""Best FPS"", ""Best Movie Game"" and ""Best Local Multiplayer Game"".
On Game Rankings, GoldenEye 007 has been ranked number 5 on the voting average list with an average vote of 9.2.
The game continues to be played by fans, many of whom have developed online communities. There are those who enjoy replaying single-player levels in an attempt to achieve fast times, those who battle others in its deathmatch mode, while others use GameSharks and similar devices to examine and to modify the game's code. On October 25, 2006, a fansite, The Rare Witch Project, released a level editor that allows users to place objects and write AI routines for existing stages on a ROM image, so new stages can be developed.
The James Bond game license was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1999, which published new games based upon the then-recent James Bond films Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough. The latter game, along with others published by EA such as Agent Under Fire and Nightfire are similar in style to GoldenEye 007.
In the autumn of 2004, Electronic Arts released GoldenEye: Rogue Agent for Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and later the Nintendo DS. This is the first game based on the 007 franchise in which the player does not take on the role of James Bond himself; rather they control an aspiring 00-agent (named GoldenEye) who is recruited by Auric Goldfinger. The game has little to do with either the film GoldenEye or the N64 game. It was released to mediocre reviews, and was criticized for using the ""GoldenEye"" name in an attempt to exploit the success of Rare's game
In the aftermath of E3 2006 Activision obtained the rights for James Bond games from MGM and EON, and their first game Quantum of Solace was released on October 31, 2008 which was developed by Treyarch.
Reggie Fils-Aime, the President of Nintendo of America, announced that Nintendo is exploring the possibility of adding GoldenEye 007 to the Wii Virtual Console, despite a complicated situation in which the game's developer Rare is owned by Microsoft and the video game rights to the James Bond franchise are held by Activision. He stated, ""We would love to see it [on the Virtual Console], so we're exploring all the rights issues.""
On January 11, 2008, 1UP reported that a GoldenEye port had been in development at Rare for several months, but stated that the title would not be released on the Xbox Live Arcade since ""Microsoft and Nintendo couldn't agree on the financial side of things.""

526,/wiki/Barbara_Jefford,"Mary Barbara Jefford, OBE (born 26 July 1930) is a British Shakespearean actress best known for her  theatrical performances with the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Old Vic and the National Theatre, and her role as Molly Bloom in the 1967 film of James Joyce's Ulysses. In 1959 she appeared as Ophelia in a TV production of Hamlet. For the James Bond film From Russia with Love (1963) she provided the uncredited voice of Tatiana Romanova, played by Daniela Bianchi. Jefford provided additional voice work in later Bond films, dubbing Molly Peters in Thunderball (1965) and Caroline Munro in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977).
"
527,/wiki/Bond_girls,"
A Bond Girl is a character who portrays a significant supporting role or a love interest in a James Bond film, novel or video game. They typically have names that are double entendres, such as ""Pussy Galore"" or ""Plenty O'Toole.""
Bond girls might be victims rescued by Bond, fellow agents or allies, villainesses or members of an enemy organization. Other female characters such as Judi Dench's M, Rosa Klebb, Irma Bunt and Miss Moneypenny are not classified as Bond girls.
The role of a Bond girl is typically a high-profile part that can give a major boost to the career of unestablished actresses, although there have been a number of Bond girls that were well-established prior to gaining their role. For instance, Diana Rigg and Honor Blackman were both Bond girls after becoming major stars for their roles on the television series, The Avengers. Additionally, Halle Berry won an Academy Award in 2002, an award presented to her while in the midst of filming Die Another Day.
Ursula Andress is often considered the first Bond girl, playing Honey Ryder in the film Dr. No (1962). She was, however, preceded by Eunice Gayson who played the character Sylvia Trench. Trench is the only Bond girl to appear as the same character in more than one film, appearing again in From Russia with Love (1963). Initially, Trench was planned to be a regular girlfriend of Bond's in the series, but was subsequently dropped after the encore appearance.
It should be noted that Valerie Mathis was the first ever Bond girl on screen in the 1954 version of Casino Royale. She was played by Linda Christian.
To date, only two Bond girls has captured the heart of James Bond. Tracy di Vicenzo played by Diana Rigg, marries Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). At film's end, Tracy Bond is gunned down by 007's nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld. It was initially planned that her death would actually occur in Diamonds Are Forever (1971), but this idea was dropped during filming of On Her Majesty's Secret Service when current-Bond George Lazenby announced he would step down from the role. The other girl is Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale (2006) who was secretly working for Bond's enemies and shared the same fate.
Within the official series, Maud Adams is the only actress to portray a main character as two different Bond girls in two different films, starting as Andrea Anders in The Man with the Golden Gun in 1974 and again as the title character in Octopussy (1983). She additionally appears as an extra in a third Bond film, A View to a Kill in 1985. Two other girls, Martine Beswick (Thunderball) and Nadja Regin (Goldfinger) also appear in a second adventure, appearing first in From Russia with Love. Tsai Chin appeared in two Bond films as well You Only Live Twice (1967) as a Ling and later as Madam Wu in Casino Royale (2006).
In 1995 Famke Janssen, who portrayed Xenia Onatopp, was considered the only major female character (and villain) whom Bond does not bed. However in 2008, lead Bond Girl Camille Montes also shows a restraint to Bond's usually forward charms.
Becoming more frequent, traditional Bond girls that have romantic trysts with Bond, are later discovered to be villainesses starting with Sophie Marceau's Elektra King in The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Miranda Frost portrayed by Rosamund Pike in Die Another Day (2002).
In late 2014, it was announced that Monica Bellucci will play Lucia Sciarra in Spectre (2015). At age 50, Bellucci made record as the oldest Bond girl in the film series. Previously, Honor Blackman held record, playing Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, aged 39 in 1964. Both actresses play the unlikely role, of being a Bond girl older than James Bond.

In addition to those actresses mentioned above, the Bond films traditionally have groups of women in the background whose general purpose is nothing more than eye candy: they include the sunbathing Miami beauties and Pussy Galore's Flying Circus in Goldfinger, the Thai girls at the kung fu school in The Man With the Golden Gun, Tiger Tananka's bathing beauties in You Only Live Twice, and Sheik Hossein's harem in The Spy Who Loved Me. However, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, A View to a Kill, and The Living Daylights these women were also referred to in the media as full fledge Bond girls to provide added publicity for the film through eye-catching magazine and newspaper appearances.
In On Her Majesty's Secret Service, they include Blofeld's Angels of Death. In Moonraker (1979) this included members of Hugo Drax's ""master race"" and a group of women encountered by Bond in the jungles of Brazil, in For Your Eyes Only (1981) many women were seen frolicking around a villain's pool, while in Octopussy (1983) they served mainly as the title character's servants and guards. In A View to a Kill (1985) they adorned Max Zorin's outdoor reception and in The Living Daylights (1987) they served as decorations at the villain's swimming pool and later Bond overpasses a harem in Tangiers. Although the Bond films haven't stopped making use of feminine ""eye candy"" completely, such large ""Bond girl groups"" have not featured again since The Living Daylights.
Mary Goodnight was a supporting character in several Bond novels before graduating to full Bond girl in The Man with the Golden Gun. The short stories ""Quantum of Solace"", ""The Living Daylights"" and ""The Property of a Lady"" feature female characters in prominent roles, but none of these women interact with Bond in any sort of romantic fashion.

529,/wiki/For_Your_Eyes_Only_(film),"For Your Eyes Only (1981) is the twelfth spy film in the James Bond series, and the fifth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It marked the directorial debut of John Glen, who had worked as editor and second unit director in three other Bond films.
The screenplay by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson takes its characters and combines the plots from two short stories from Ian Fleming's For Your Eyes Only collection: the title story and ""Risico."" In the plot, Bond attempts to locate a missile command system while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek businessmen along with Melina Havelock, a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents. Some writing elements were inspired by the novels Live and Let Die, Goldfinger and On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
After the over-the-top, science fiction-focused Moonraker, the producers wanted a conscious return to the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. For Your Eyes Only followed a more gritty, realistic approach, and an unusually strong narrative theme of revenge and its consequences. Filming locations included Greece, Italy, Spain and England, with underwater footage being shot in The Bahamas.
For Your Eyes Only was released on 24 June 1981 initally to a mixed to positive critical reception, though overall in later years have been positively recived; the film was a financial success, generating $195.3 million worldwide. This was the last Bond film to be distributed solely by United Artists; the studio merged with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer soon after this film's release.
While visiting the grave of his deceased wife, Tracy, James Bond is called back to MI6 headquarters. A helicopter arrives to transport him. During the flight the pilot is killed by electricity that surges through his headset and a familiar voice begins to taunt Bond over the chopper's loudspeaker; it is that of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Bond's arch-nemesis, who survived the event of Diamonds are Forever but now wheel-chair bounded and seeks revenge against Bond for dismantling SPECTRE. As Bond struggles to gain control of the chopper, he notices a man in a motorized wheelchair nearby. Bond manages to reach the pilot's seat but cannot operate the 'copter. Blofeld, controlling the 'copter with a small console, flies the chopper into a giant foundry building, with the intention of letting it crash. Bond realizes that a set of cables have been wired to the chopper and he rips them out, regaining control of it. He flies after Blofeld and hooks his wheelchair on the end of the chopper's landing skid. Though Blofeld pleads for his life, Bond vengefully drops him down a nearby smokestack, finally killing his nemesis for good and avenging Tracy.
In the Adriatic Sea, a disguised Maltese fishing ship, the St. Georges, trawls off the coast of Albania. Inside is a hidden control room for British defense. The spy ship is equipped with ATAC (Automatic Targeting and Attack Communicator), a valuable defensive and offensive device that the Soviet Union would like to obtain. When the ship's decoy fishing crew hauls in a net, it brings with it an old anti-warship mine which explodes, sinking the St. Georges. At MI6, M's temporary replacement, Chief-of-Staff Bill Tanner, is informed of the incident. When he asks how deep the water is off the coast of Albania, he is told it isn't ""deep enough."" Hoping to find the St. Georges and the ATAC discreetly, Tanner orders a British underwater archeologist, Tim Havelock to find the St. Georges. Meanwhile, Tanner's KGB counterpart, Anatol Gogol, is told that the ATAC is in play, and instructs an unknown contact to procure it for him.
The Havelock's daughter, Melina, arrives by plane at her father's yacht near the site of the St. Georges' sinking after taking a vacation in France. While she reunites with her parents the plane she was brought in suddenly strafes the yacht with a burst of machine-gun fire. Both Havelock and his wife are killed, however, Melina is unharmed. She looks on with a look of despair and rage on her face.
In London, James Bond is called into M's office to meet with Tanner and Minister of Defense, Sir Fredrick Gray. He is ordered to find the ATAC, his first lead being the man, Hector Gonzales, a pilot and Cuban national who killed the Havelocks. Tanner orders Bond to find Gonzales near Madrid and interrogate him for information.
Bond goes to Gonzales' home where he's throwing a party. Bond observes that Gonzales is meeting with a mysterious man in an elegant suit and octagonal wire-framed glasses, and deduces that he is paying Gonzales for the assassination he performed. Bond is captured by a security guard and brought to Gonzales who identifies him immediately as British Secret Service and orders him taken away. As he dives into his pool, Gonzales is struck and killed by a crossbow arrow fired by an unseen assassin. The distraction allows Bond to escape. Wire-Frames does not intervene and instead leaves with the money that he intended to pay Gonzales. As Bond makes his escape, one of the security guards chasing him is killed also by a crossbow bolt. The shooter is revealed to be Melina Havelock, who has been seeking revenge for the deaths of her parents. Before they can escape in Bond's Lotus Esprit, it explodes when a guard tries to break one of its windows. Bond and Melina use her car, a small, clunky Citroën, in a furious chase where they evade Gonzales' men in a wild chase through a small town and through an orchard.
Back in London, Bond reports back to MI6, where the upset Tanner reprimands him for failing to obtain any information from Gonzales. However, Bond, with Q's assistance, uses a highly sophisticated database called an Identigraph, to identify and locate Wire-Frames. The man is revealed to be Emile Leopold Locque, a Belgian assassin who has worked as an enforcer for numerous crime syndicates. The most recent intel suggests he is operating in Cortina d'Ampezzo in northern Italy.
Bond travels to Cortina and meets Luigi Ferrara, an Italian Secret Service agent who tells him that Locque may be associated with an organization called the White Dove (indicated by the pin Locque and it's members wear). He directs Bond to his most reliable contact in the Greek Underworld, Aristotle Kristatos. Kristatos identifies the White Dove's leader as Milos Columbo, the kingpin of Greece's heroin trade. Kristatos asks Bond to be an escort for his young skating protege, Bibi Dahl, while she watches the biathlon. Bibi tries to seduce Bond in his hotel room, but Bond refuses her advances due to her young age.
At the biathlon, Bibi points out a friend of her's, Erich Kriegler, a competitor in the event. Bond bids Bibi farewell and leaves the event; as he skis away, he is attacked by a small group of thugs on winterized motorcycles. One of them is Kriegler himself, who tries to kill Bond with his sniper's rifle, another is Locque. Bond is able to escape his attackers, killing several of them in the process.
Bond meets Bibi later at the Olympic skating rink where Bibi is practicing. He asks her about Erich and finds out that he is an East German defector. After Bibi leaves, he is again attacked, this time by three hulking hockey players. Bond beats them all and returns to his car. There he finds that Ferrara has been killed. In Ferrara's dead hand is a White Dove pin.
Bond goes to the business section of Cortina the next day and spots Melina buying a crossbow. As he approaches her, they are both attacked by men on motorcycles, much like Bond the previous day. Bond kills both attackers and orders Melina to leave Cortina. He also tells her that her need for revenge may get her killed too. She agrees to return to her father's yacht and wait for word from Bond.
Bond travels to Greece to continue his investigation of Columbo. At a nightclub, he meets with Kristatos and asks how to meet Columbo, not knowing that Columbo's men are secretly recording their conversation. Columbo is at the same club and is sitting with a woman, Lisl von Schlaf, a countess. She becomes openly insulted by one of Columbo's comments and proceeds to leave. Seeing an opportunity to learn more about Columbo, Bond approaches Lisl and offers to have Kristatos' valet, Apostis, drive her back to her hotel. After Apostis leaves, Bond and Lisl spend the night together. Lisl confesses that Columbo knows that Bond is a secret agent, and has asked her to learn more about him. Unbeknownst to either of them, Apostis is secretly listening in on their conversation.
In the morning, the two walk on the beach and are attacked by Locque and another White Dove member, Claus. Locque kills Lisl by running her down in his dune buggy, and he and Claus capture Bond. Claus is suddenly shot by a harpoon and several men wearing the White Dove emblem appear out of the surf and capture Bond.
Bond is taken to Columbo himself on a yacht, who tries to convince the spy that Kristatos is actually the real villain and the one behind the search for the ATAC. As a means to prove this, he invites Bond to accompany his men to Albania, where Kristatos is using a shipping warehouse to process heroin. Bond reluctantly agrees, and they find Locque overseeing a shipment of raw opium smuggled in enormous rolls of newsprint. They also discover some old naval mines, implying that the sinking of the St. Georges was no accident. As his men provide cover, Locque wires explosives to one of the mines, taking the detonator with him to a nearby escape car. Locque detonates the explosives to cover his escape, but Columbo's raiding party are able to flee the warehouse before it explodes. Using an underground tunnel, Bond is able to get to the shipyard's entrance before Locque does. He opens fire on Locque's car, hitting the assassin in the shoulder and causing him to lose control of the vehicle, which careens of the road. As Locque's car precariously teeters on the precipice of a cliff, Bond shows him the dove pin he'd gotten from Ferrara, throws it to Locque; the tiny shift in weight causes the car to slide off the cliff. Bond gives the car a hard kick and it plummets, killing Locque.
Bond travels to the Havelock's yacht and finds Melina. Bond asks Melina if her father possibly left behind any information about his work for the British government. Melina shows Bond her father's journal and they discover that her father had been diving in an unusual underwater location.
The two go there in her father's mini-submarine and find the St. Georges. The enter the wreck and find the ATAC attached to an explosive charge which had failed to be activated. Bond disarms the bomb and takes the ATAC when the two are attacked by a diver in a JIM suit. Bond manages to escape the killer and attaches the ATAC bomb to the JIM suit, destroying it. Nearly out of breathable air, he and Melina return to the mini-sub but are again attacked by another mini-sub. They are able to escape this man as well.
They return to the surface to find that Kristatos, accompanied by Kriegler and Apostis, has seized the Havelock yacht and killed the crew. Kristatos takes the ATAC with the intention of selling it to the Soviet government; Kriegler is revealed to be his KGB contact. Using Melina and Bond as ""bait"" they tow them behind Kristatos' yacht hoping that sharks will eat them. Bond is able to snap the line binding them and they retreat to a SCUBA tank Melina left on the ocean floor. Kristatos, assuming Bond and Melina are both dead, leaves.
The two make it back to their yacht and hear her father's parrot reveal the destination of the ATAC, a location only called ""St. Cyril's."" Q informs Bond that there are over 300 locations with the same name in all of Greece, however, Bond knows that Columbo will know where Kristatos has retreated to.
The St. Cyril's that Columbo knows of is a monastery in the northern mountains of Greece and sits atop a series of sheer cliffs. It is only accessible on the ground by a cabled basket; Bond must scale the cliff to reach the machinery controlling the basket. As he climbs, he is found by Apostis, who tries to loosen the spikes and climbing rope Bond is using as a safety line. Bond is able to make it up the cliff far enough to throw a spike at Apostis and send him off the cliff. He makes it the basket house and lowers it for the rest of the crew to come up.
General Gogol is on his way to the monastery to collect the ATAC. Kristatos attempts to flee with the ATAC, with Columbo and Melina in hot pursuit. Kriegler attacks Bond, nearly overpowering him due to his size, before Bond takes him out with a spiked candelabra and races after Columbo and Melina. Kristatos and Columbo fight. Kristatos knocks Columbo out, only to be cornered by Melina, who seeks to kill him to avenge her parents' death. While Bond and Melina argue over whether to execute Kristatos or simply arrest him, Kristatos pulls a switchblade out of his jacket. Before Kristatos can attack Melina or Bond, Columbo regains consciousness and kills him with a throwing knife. Gogol arrives and genially asks for the ATAC; Bond suddenly throws it over the side of the mountain where it shatters hundreds of feet below. Gogol is visibly shocked at first but Bond replies ""That's Detente, Comrade! You don't have it, I don't have it."" Gogol suddenly smiles and leaves, obviously humored.
Melina and Bond share a romantic evening on board the Havelock yacht when a call arrives from MI6 on Bond's wristwatch. The British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, wishes to speak to Bond personally. Bond gives the watch to Melina's parrot and the PM is tricked into thinking she's still speaking to Bond, who has joined Melina for a nude moonlight swim.
For Your Eyes Only is perhaps most notable for its pre-title sequence which shows the final comeuppance of the supervillain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Bond's enemy in five previous films (although the character here is unnamed due to legal issues). The opening of the film revisits many older elements of the Bond character, beginning with Bond laying flowers at the grave of his wife, Tracy Bond (one of the few times she is mentioned in the series after On Her Majesty's Secret Service), and culminating in Blofeld's attempt to exact revenge on Bond for foiling his plans and for the downfall of his criminal organization SPECTRE. The whole sequence was initially scripted to aid the introduction and establishment of a new actor to portray James Bond since Roger Moore, who had starred in four previous films, was reluctant to return - Timothy Dalton is often cited as the planned replacement, and indeed the film overall features many darker moments and a more down-to-earth feel more suited to Dalton's portrayal than to Moore's. The industrial chimney used in the opening scene was part of the North Thames gasworks in London.
The reason the appearance of the Blofeld character remains somewhat ambiguous here (he is not explicitly named, despite his demise clearly being of huge importance to the series) relate to a legal battle dating back to the publication of the James Bond novel Thunderball in 1961. At that time, Kevin McClory claimed that Ian Fleming had adapted the novel from a screenplay for a proposed film adaptation of the Bond character that the two had worked on together, and that he, not Fleming, had come up with the S.P.E.C.T.R.E. organisation and the character of Ernst Stavro Blofeld. As the legal dispute had left McClory with the rights to the Blofeld character, the studio was forced to leave Blofeld's appearance in For Your Eyes Only ambiguous (while at the same time using many of the character's well-known traits from earlier movies - bald head, white cat - to convey the message of who he really was). The demise of Blofeld finally tied up the plot hole of his disappearance in Diamonds Are Forever, and was added by the production staff to show that the James Bond series did not need Blofeld and was content to move on after a number of attempts by Kevin McClory to produce a rival Bond film based on his ownership of the character. This includes a failed attempt in the late 1970s of an original Bond film that resulted in a lawsuit brought about by EON and United Artists. Nevertheless McClory was able to film a remake of Thunderball entitled Never Say Never Again which was released opposite Octopussy in 1983.
Two other controversial incidents also occurred with the release of For Your Eyes Only. The first involving the film's teaser poster artwork, which showcased a model in thong-like shorts holding a crossbow with Bond framed between her long legs. This was deemed in some U.S. states as indecent exposure. A later version of the teaser was released with a superimposed pair of shorts painted over the original artwork. The other controversial incident wasn't revealed until some time after the release, in which it was discovered that one girl, Caroline Cossey (aka Tula), was transsexual. This gained attention years later when Tula was a guest on the Howard Stern show, in which Stern expressed admiration that even the Bond producers were fooled. Due to both controversies, it was incorrectly assumed by some to be one and the same, i.e. Tula was the girl on the poster. However, this is untrue; an unnamed model served as the ""crossbow girl"", whereas Tula was briefly seen at Hector Gonzalez's pool party.
For Your Eyes Only marked a creative change of direction for the Bond film series. John Glen was promoted from his duties as a film editor to director, a position he would occupy throughout the 1980s. A result of this being a harder-edged directorial style, with less emphasis on gadgetry and large action sequences in huge arenas (as was favoured by Lewis Gilbert). More emphasis on tension, plot, and character was also added in addition to a return to Bond's more serious roots.
A good example of this is a scene in which Bond kicks a car with a villain inside over a cliff, essentially murdering him in cold blood. This was, and still is to this day controversial amongst fans to whether Ian Fleming's James Bond would do such an act. Roger Moore was also strongly opposed to the aforementioned scene in which Bond kills the villain Locque, claiming his Bond wouldn't do such a thing. This, however, contradicts the fact that his Bond kills at least two, possibly three people in cold blood in the earlier film, The Spy Who Loved Me (namely, a thug Bond lets fall off a roof, the villain Karl Stromberg who Bond executes after he's been disarmed, and possibly a woman who Bond may or may not intentionally use as a human shield). Nonetheless, this scene was the strongest display of Bond exercising his licence to kill since the killing of Professor Dent by Sean Connery's Bond in Dr. No.
Throughout the entire James Bond series of films, this is the only movie where M is absent. Bernard Lee had died while preparing for the film, and instead of recasting, the role was left vacant out of respect. Miss Moneypenny, M's personal secretary claims that he is on leave, and his chair is filled by his 'Chief of Staff', Bill Tanner, with M's lines being shared between Tanner and the Minister of Defence. The role was recast for Octopussy.
Today For Your Eyes Only is often considered a contender alongside The Spy Who Loved Me as Moore's best Bond film. Overall, For Your Eyes Only accumulated a box office gross of $195,300,000, which at the time was the second highest grossing Bond film after its previous entry Moonraker.
As mentioned earlier, this movie turned from deux ex machina gadgets and wide-open action sequences to smaller and more ""personal"" scenes. The resulting sequences are arguably some of the best of the series, and are generally extremely well filmed.
One example of the change in thinking is the simple scene in which Bond confronts the killer Locque. Locque is attempting to escape in a car, but is forced to drive up a steep hill along a road containing a number of sharp switchback curves. Bond follows on foot, running up a set of stairways bisecting the road. When the race first starts, Locque is far ahead of Bond, but as Bond reaches the next section of the road after climbing one section it is clear he is gaining on him. The scene ends with Bond climbing the last remaining flight, quite out of breath, with the camera positioned to show him reaching the road slightly ahead of Locque. The entire scene is perhaps 30 seconds, and is extremely suspenseful.
A more famous scene occurs late in the movie when Bond's team attempts to break into a mountaintop monastery being used by Kristatos to meet Gogol and turn over the ATAC. In order to gain access to the mountaintop one would normally use a cablecar, but this is being guarded. Instead Bond climbs up the sheer face of the mountain, out of sight of the guards. As he climbs he has to knock pitons into the rock face, and eventually one of the guards hears him and investigates. He sees Bond, who hides, and instead climbs down a rope of his own to start knocking out the pitons. The scene continues with Bond attempting to climb back onto the rock face, but falling further as each piton is knocked out. He eventually reaches a safe position just as the guard is in the process of knocking out the last piton, potentially sending Bond falling to the rock far below. Bond then whistles to attract the guard's attention, and uses a piton as a throwing knife to kill him, using the guard's rope to climb the rest of the way.
See: For Your Eyes Only (soundtrack)
Many of the ""underwater"" scenes, especially involving closeups of Bond and Melina, were actually faked on a dry soundstage. A combination of lighting effects, slow-motion photography, wind, and ""bubbles"" added in post-production, gave the illusion of the actors being underwater. Apparently actress Carole Bouquet had a preexisting health condition that prevented her from actually attempting any underwater stuntwork.
After the ever-more outlandish plots of The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker - the latter film literally taking Bond out of this world - it was decided that the James Bond series needed to return to reality. For Your Eyes Only attempts to go back to the more basic style of Dr. No and From Russia with Love. One of the most famous sequences of the film is when Bond's venerable Lotus Esprit is destroyed after a henchman working for Gonzales attempts to break into the car, which in turn activated the car's self-destruct function that was built into its security system. The destruction of his car forces Bond and Melina to make an escape in a Citroën 2CV, which was considered symbolic of Bond turning away from the more extreme gadgets of the past. Bond later acquires another car, a red Lotus Esprit Turbo from Q Branch when he arrives in Cortina.
Prior to the film being released Marvel Comics was given permission to publish a comic book adaptation of the movie, For Your Eyes Only. It was first released as issue 11 in the graphic novel sized 'Marvel Comics Super Special' series in July 1981, and then in regular comic book size as a two-issue limited series published in July (cover dated October/November 1981). It was also reprinted the same year in paperback book form.
Although a British comic strip had been published almost without interruption since the 1950s, this was only the second American-published comic version of a Bond story, after DC Comic's publication of Dr. No 18 years earlier. Marvel Comics would go on to produce a comic book version of Octopussy in the same 'Marvel Comics Super Special' series.
Two major differences in the comic book include the addition of M, who was technically in the initial drafts of the screenplay until Bernard Lee's death in early 1981, and the villain's given name, which for unknown reasons was ""Ari Kristatos"" instead of the film version's ""Aris Kristatos."" The comic also includes additional suggestive dialogue by Bibi Dahl (aimed at Bond) that was never used (or was perhaps was edited from) the film.
Credits for both issues of the comic book adaptation include:

536,/wiki/Bibi_Dahl_(Lynn-Holly_Johnson),"Bibi Dahl is a fictional ice-skater who appears in the 1981 James Bond film, For Your Eyes Only. She was portrayed by American ice-skater and actress, Lynn-Holly Johnson.  Bibi is the protege of Greek smuggler Aris Kristatos.
Aris Kristatos' recent financial investment, ice-skater Bibi Dahl, spends most of her days training for the upcoming Olympics with the aim and intention of walking away with the gold medal. Working to a strict training regime set by her coach, Jacoba Brink, Bibi has very little freedom in regards to spending time with those she so desires. She is blissfully unaware however, her funding is merely a front for Kristatos' double crossing nature, allowing him to appear better natured than he is.
James Bond becomes acquainted with Bibi at an ice rink in Cortina during a meeting with Kristatos; while demonstrating her captivating Olympic-calibre talents, Kristatos poses as a proud sponsor whilst telling Bond that she's innocent in the ways of the world. Kristatos introduces a tired Bibi to Bond where she immediately feels an attraction towards the double-0. Bond is at first hesitant to accept her invite to the biathlon later that day due to her younger age but accepts telling her he is staying at the Miramonte Hotel.
Arriving back at his hotel after a run in with assassins following Melina Havelock, Bond is surprised to find Bibi in his room. In his bed, naked, Bibi tells Bond the porter, a fan of hers, let her in. Bond diverts Bibi's sexual advances, once again, due to her younger age. After getting dressed the pair leave to head to the biathlon which is being held in the hills of Cortina.
After flirtatiously skiing together, Bibi takes Bond to watch East German biathlon champion Erich Kriegler, who rudely ignores her greeting; little does Bibi know, Kriegler is in fact a hitmen secretly working for Kristatos. Following the champion to watch him shoot, Bibi continues to cheer him on but is again ignored upon her advances. When Bond tells Bibi he has an appointment to attend, she asks him to say goodbye at the practice rink later that evening as he is shortly leaving for Greece.
That evening, after surviving various attacks on the hills of Cortina by assassins led by Kriegler, Bond visits Bibi at the practice rink, however with intentions of discovering more information on the mysterious German champion. Naively, Bibi tells Bond about Kriegler's personality as well as being a defector. Upon hearing Bibi discussing Kriegler, her coach, Brink, orders her to leave with her. Bibi says her farewells to Bond, hoping they aren't goodbyes.
Continuing her training at Kristatos' retreat in the mountains of Greece, Bibi has become tired of her sponsors lack of enthusiasm for her Olympic success. When Kristatos tells her he plans to move to Cuba, Bibi becomes defensive with Kristatos telling him he's too old for her and that she wants to part ways, with intentions of finding a new sponsor. Kristatos blames Brink but Bibi defends her coach too.
Shortly after, Bibi decides to leave the retreat. Packing her bags, Brink tells her she will never leave her side. When Brink joins forces with Bond, an unaware Bibi presumes Kristatos is holding her captive; confronting her sponsor, she takes a hard slap to the face after telling Kristatos to go to hell.
When Bond smashes through the window and is fought by Kriegler, Bibi attempts to assist by hitting the German hitman, but takes another hit to the face. After watching Bond defeat Kriegler, Bibi follows Bond, Melina and Columbo to confront Kristatos for the final time. After watching Columbo kill her captor, Bibi tends to Columbo's wounds. As she does this, Columbo pours money into her hands insinuating she's found a new sponsor.

537,/wiki/Hope_Eternal,"Hope Eternal was a fictional scientist and teacher employed by Warfield Academy. A one-shot antagonist voiced by American actress, Kath Soucie, the character appeared in episode 15 (""Never Lose Hope"") of the 1991 spin-off animated television series, James Bond Jr.
Hope Eternal had several degrees in electrical engineering and conducted research in the field of brainwave analysis. Her father, a brilliant scientist in his own right, developed revolutionary neuroscientific medical equipment. He was abducted by the criminal organisation, S.C.U.M., who imprisoned him in their Pacific island laboratory and forced him to alter the machine. Instead of healing, the machine would scramble the brainwaves of world leaders, turning them into zombies who took orders only from S.C.U.M.. Before they could execute their plan, 007 infiltrated and destroyed the laboratory. Mr. Eternal was secretly given a new identity by the CIA to keep his whereabouts secret; largely in order to protect Hope, who might have been interrogated by S.C.U.M. for his location, had she known. However, Hope believed that 007 had murdered her father in cold blood and continued her father's work; rebuilding the brain scrambler to take vengeance upon 007's nephew, James Bond Jr.
Roughly a year later, having failed on several occasions to kidnap the youth, Hope applied for a teaching position at Warfield Academy. Replacing the departing science teacher, Mr. Pollock, she staged her own abduction during an outing to the planetarium; leaving a series of map coordinates to the now-abandoned S.C.U.M. island. Having lured Bond and his friends to the island, she captured them and shackled the youth to the operating table. Before she could scramble his brainwaves, Bond activated his rocket boots and launched the table into the equipment behind him - causing it to overload. In the chaos, he freed himself and raised a cage around Eternal and her assistant, pulling the plug before the machine exploded. On returning to Warfield, Buddy Mitchell revealed to Hope that her father is alive. She embraced her father, apologising profusely to Bond. Her fate is ultimately unknown.

540,/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld_(Literary),"In the novel series by Ian Fleming, Blofeld makes three appearances in what is considered the 'Blofeld Trilogy'. In John Griswold's 'Ian Fleming's James Bond', George Almond provided illustrations depicting Blofeld in each novel, based on Fleming's own descriptions of the character.
Fleming details Blofeld's background in the novel Thunderball; none of his background is ever revealed in the Bond films. Ernst Stavro Blofeld was born on May 28, 1908 to a Polish father and a Greek mother in Gdynia. Blofeld attended the University of Warsaw where he studied economics and political history. He later went to the Warsaw Technical Institute to study engineering and radionics. He then took a communication position with the Polish government, at the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. He began to use his position for insider trading, buying and selling stocks at the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Foreseeing World War II, Blofeld made copies of top-secret wires and sold them to Nazi Germany. Before the German invasion of Poland in 1939, he destroyed all records of his existence, then moved to Turkey, where he worked for Turkish radio and set up an intelligence organization. During the war, he sold information to both sides. After the defeat of Erwin Rommel, he decided to back the Allied war effort; ironically, he was awarded numerous medals by the Allied powers after the war's end. After the war, Blofeld temporarily moved to South America before founding SPECTRE.
Despite his willingness to murder millions to get what he wants, Blofeld has a few professional scruples. For instance, in the novel Thunderball he learned that during a standard fundraising kidnapping mission of a young girl, the responsible agent had sexual relations with her. Although Blofeld says that the relations may have been ""voluntary or involuntary on the girl's part,"" he had the agent killed as punishment and returned the girl and half the ransom to her father as compensation. His reasons had nothing to do with morality, but rather with the importance of SPECTRE being known for keeping their word to those they did their ""business"" with. Blofeld ruled by fear mixed with respect from his subordinates. When a SPECTRE agent fell out of line he was publicly made an example of with various methods of death.
Blofeld finishes looking over his cohorts in crime, noting the one member of SPECTRE who evades his glance. He takes a violet-scented breath freshener, as is his custom before saying something disagreeable. Blofeld reviews SPECTRE's crimes of the last few years, including drugs, espionage, and blackmail, netting a healthy profit to the criminal organization. The current undertaking is Plan Omega, a much more profitable venture.
Blofeld moves on to discuss the last undertaking, a kidnapping. He has No. 7, one of the French mafia men, stand. Blofeld recounts how the kidnapped girl was molested during the kidnapping. Perhaps it was consensual, perhaps not, but it violated SPECTRE's promise to return the girl untouched. As a result, Blofeld has returned half of the million-dollar ransom. The standing man, No. 7, knows he is innocent and No. 12 is guilty, but he trusts Blofeld and remains standing. Blofeld then promptly kills No. 12 and acknowledges that he was merely using No. 7 to throw No. 12 off guard.
In You Only Live Twice published in 1964, Blofeld returns and is found by Bond to be in hiding in Japan under the alias Dr. Guntram Shatterhand. In this appearance rather than being just thin has gained some muscles, has a gold-capped tooth, a fully healed nose, and a drooping grey mustache. Bond describes Blofeld on their confrontation as being ""a big man, perhaps six foot three (190 cm), and powerfully built"". Bond strangles him to death at the end of the novel. In both On Her Majesty's Secret Service and You Only Live Twice, he is aided in his schemes by Irma Bunt, who is clearly his lover in the latter and posing as Shatterhand's wife. Bond incapacitates her in their Japanese castle base before it blows up, killing Bunt.
The final mention of Blofeld is in the beginning of the next book, The Man with the Golden Gun, published in 1965.

542,/wiki/Colonel_Ping_(David_K._S._Tse),"Suspecting that a third party was manipulating events to kill Stefan Pomerov, James Bond examines the Turkish courier's phone which had led him to the Russian industrialist. Beside several local phone calls, Bond observed that Bernin had received an unanswered international call before he died. Phoning the number, 007 discovers that Colonel Fu San Ping, an influential Chinese agent, had been attempting to contact the courier. Ping suggests an alliance and meets with Bond at an aquarium in Bangkok, Thailand.  At the aquarium, Ping asks Bond to complete one simple task before meeting in person: find and disable three audio surveillance bugs in the aquarium.  After Bond does so and meets with Ping at the whale exhibit, Ping reveals that an economic mercenary has been stealing dangerous technological secrets and selling them to the highest bidder. Related to this, he had a team in Geneva following a lead on a man called Rak who operates out of Bangkok. Before Ping can reveal more, an assassin kills him with a single bullet to the head.
In the Nintendo DS version of Blood Stone, the aquarium where Bond and Ping meet is a one-story building comprising of ten exhibits, with each one dedicated to a certain marine animal and connected by short tunnels.  The task that Ping asks Bond to complete to meet safely is to have him find and photograph secret fragments of a picture of a shark found on the glass of different tanks in the exhibits, which Bond puts together to determine that Ping is in the shark exhibit, where the two have their fateful meeting as usual.
At one point in the game, he is incorrectly referred to as ""General Ping"" when the objective prompts Bond to meet him at the aquarium after deactivating the bugs planted across the location. This is likely a leftover from an earlier incarnation of the game in which Ping was supposedly depicted as an older man than he was in the final form of the title.

The AS355 first appeared in the 1997 James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies as a helicopter owned and operated by the Carver Media Group Network in Vietnam. An AS355 F1 was subsequently featured in 1999's The World Is Not Enough as an overgrowth-clearing helicopter utilised by King Industries.
After discovering the wreck of the British ship HMS Devonshire in the South China Sea, James Bond and Wai Lin, a Chinese spy on the same case, are captured by the henchmen of media mogul Elliot Carver and are taken by AS355 to the CMGN tower in Saigon, Vietnam. After escaping the building, the pair grab a BMW R1200C motorbike and are chased through the streets of Saigon by the helicopter. Its pilot eventually attempts to mow down the pair using the aircraft's main rotor, but is outmanoeuvred and crashes in flames.
Whilst investigating the activities of oil heiress Elektra King at a caviar factory owned by Valentin Zukovsky, James Bond fends off an assassination attempt using two AS355 helicopters with buzz saw pendants, known as aerial side-trimmers. The devices are essentially a string of rotating buzzsaws affixed to the bottom of a helicopter. In normal operation, the pilot navigates his aircraft into position alongside overgrowth, engages the saws, and slices through the vegetative foliage. In the hands of King Industry's assassins, the blades cut through wooden platforms and even 007's BMW Z8, whilst gunmen fire from its exposed cockpit. Bond uses a ground-to-air rocket from his Z8 to shoot down the first aircraft and utilises a gas pipe and flare gun to destroy the second.

545,/wiki/Dauphin_Baleine,"Ludovic de Baleine is a fictional French aristocrat who styled himself as Dauphin Baleine, an heir to the throne in France and future ruler of Europe. The character was one of several primary antagonists created for the 2015 video-game James Bond: World of Espionage and first appeared during its Slow Down Faster story-line.
After defeating Korean warlord Whar Zin, James Bond recovers a brass key in his prion laboratory which matches a safety deposit box in Switzerland. 007 travels to the Alps in search of a matching key, which he discovers in the possession of Anaelle Brouchard, a 'ward' of the mysterious Ludovic de Baleine. Inside the strongbox are a set of plans which outline Baleine's scheme to completely destroy the European Union's currency. Baleine, who believes himself to be a Dauphin of France, plans to seize control of the EU in its wake. Discovering Bond's interference, the Dauphin dispatches assassins led by his tall and immensely strong henchman, Dragomir. After evading the assassin and enlisting Anaelle's help, 007 and his French smuggler contact Justine Dubois infiltrate Baleine's fortress by helicopter, while Anaelle attempts to distract the Dauphin. Bond succeeds at destroying his base of operations and foils his scheme to topple the EU.

546,/wiki/Fukutu_(Tom_So),"Fukutu is a fictional card player and minor character from EON Productions' 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale. He was portrayed by Tom So.
He is one of the ten card player (included Bond, Le Chiffre and Leiter) who takes part the poker match at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. He played on the final party with Bond, Le Chiffre and Infante. He lost with a straight flush against Bond.
He made a cameo appearance in Skyfall in a Macau casino.
"
547,/wiki/Aki,"Aki is a fictional agent of the Japanese Secret Service who appeared in the 1967 James Bond film, You Only Live Twice, portrayed by actress Akiko Wakabayashi.
When the movie got dubbed in Japanese, Aki was voiced by Kazue Komiya and Mayuno Yasokawa in the TBS and DVD/Blu-Ray versions, respectively.
Aki is first seen when 007 meets her at a sumo wrestling show. Bond is there to meet a contact who will take him to Mr. Henderson, M's recommended contact in Japan. He confirms that Aki is his contact by saying the code words ""I love you"" to her. Aki takes Bond to meet Henderson in her Toyota 2000GT. After Henderson is killed during their meeting, Bond attacks and kills one of Henderson's killers. Taking the man's place, he is driven to the Osato Chemical Works HQ, where he is discovered by the villains. Aki rescues him, using her skills as a driver, then takes him to meet her boss, Tiger Tanaka. It is after this that a bikini-clad Aki invites Bond to spend the night with her, famously saying ""I think I will enjoy very much serving under you"", before Bond carries her to bed.
At Tanaka's house, the shapely and scantily-dressed Aki unnoticeably swaps with Bond's masseuse and gives him a kiss. As he carries her away she remarks that nobody will disturb them tonight and that she ""will enjoy serving under him"".
Shortly after Bond's arrival at the ninja academy, an assassin stealthily enters the bedroom where Bond and Aki are sleeping together and lowers a thin cord to Bond's mouth, intending to poison him. At the last moment, Bond turns in his sleep and Aki moves to his position and the poison falls on her lips which she inadvertently swallows. The poison acts quickly, causing Aki great pain; after a few agonized seconds of gasping for breath, she dies.
The original name of the character was Suki. It was changed out of gratitude to actress Akiko Wakabayashi, who had originally been cast as the film's other Bond girl, Kissy Suzuki. It was discovered that Mie Hama, who had originally been cast in the Suki/Aki role spoke poor English and the producers were concerned that she would not be able to cope with the part. They were, however, fearful that if they fired her, she would consider that by being fired she had brought shame on her family, and might commit suicide.
As a result, they built up the role of Suki/Aki, decreased the number of lines Kissy had and asked Wakabayashi if she would agree to switch parts. She agreed, and they renamed the character to thank her. In the finished film, Kissy plays a far smaller part than Aki (and is actually billed after her in the credits), even though she is generally regarded as being the lead Bond girl.
Certainly, Bond builds far more of a relationship with Aki, and may possibly be falling in love with her, as evinced by a scene where Tanaka tells him that when he goes undercover as a Japanese fisherman, the role will require him to have a ""wife."" Bond immediately looks to Aki, and her pleased reaction clearly shows that the idea appeals to both of them (although Tanaka vetoes it, as the ""wife"" - Kissy - needs to be an operative who is a native of the region Bond is staking out).
Indeed, Aki is among the more pro-active female characters from the 1960s Bond films, and her character has some similarities to that of Tracy Bond, who Bond would marry for real in the series' next film On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Both are depicted as intelligent women who can take care of themselves, both save Bond from the villains during the course of the story, and both are excellent drivers, taking the wheel during the films' respective main car chases. Bond's reaction to Aki's death is also stronger than similar characters such as Jill Masterson.
"
548,/wiki/Grishenko,"Boris Ivanovich Grishenko (In Russian: Борис Иванович Грищенко) was a fictional Russian computer technician at the GoldenEye control center in Severnaya, Siberia. He appeared as henchman to Alec Trevelyan in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye and was portrayed by Scottish actor Alan Cumming. The character also appeared in John Gardner's accompanying novelization and in 1997 video game adaptation.
Boris Grishenko worked at the Severnaya observatory in Siberia which watched over the two weapons satellites, Petya and Mischa. He is first seen helping fellow programmer Natalya Simonova get into a programme by using a perverse female password much to another fellow programmer Anna Nishkov's disgust, especially when she sees a perverted cartoon likeness of herself on the screen. She scoffs at his boorish attitude, remarking ""He wouldn't know woman if one came up and sat on his head,"" much to Natalya's amusement.
Another program Boris made was to triangulate on the origin of an outside program, he hacked into the US Department of Defense. Boris finished it to the FBI by sending a spike, with a message ""Better luck next time, slugheads.""
Later, Boris disappeared when he was ""going for a cigarette"" and was never seen again. He had actually slipped away and flew off with General Arkady Ourumov and Xenia Onatopp, having allied himself with them and Alec Trevelyan, head of Janus to steal the GoldenEye satellite, but not before Xenia massacred multiple Severnaya employees and activated a satellite to fire on Severnaya as ""target practice"" in electromagnetic warfare. This succeeded, as the Severnaya facility was destroyed. A Russian airbase a few hundred kilometers away was alerted that Severnaya was under attack, and deployed three fighter jets to intercept the attackers. The electromagnetic pulse had killed the fighter pilots as well, with one jet crashing into the satellite dish.
Natalya was the sole survivor of the Severnaya massacre, as she had hid herself in a cupboard which had shielded her from the radiation and ensuing debris. Believing Boris to be innocent and of good fortune to have excused himself for a smoke prior to the carnage, she shouted for Boris, believing him to be in the area (unaware he was spirited away by Ourumov).
Ourumov later reports to the Russian Defense Minister Dmitri Mishkin, passing off Grishenko as a lucky survivor. Natalya, still also under the impression that Grishenko was lucky to have survived, attempts to contact him via email. After telling him that Ourumov shot everyone at the bunker, Boris tells her to meet him at a nearby church and to trust no one. At the church, Boris lets Onatopp capture Natalya.
After saving Natalya and killing Ourumov, James Bond does not know how to locate Alec's base. By accessing the computer inside the train Natalya manages to hack inside Boris' network. Although Boris tries to rip out his servers, Natalya finds out that the base is at Cuba.
At the base, Trevelyan tells Boris to heave the base out of the lake. Boris claims that he is not ready but Trevelyan angrily urges him to do it anyway. After the base has emerged, Trevelyan hands Boris the GoldenEye master control key, threateningly telling Boris that it better be working. While Boris makes the final preparations, Trevelyan is handed a tablet by one of his henchman and watches footage of Bond and Natalya sneaking onto the base. He sends his men to deal with Bond and orders Boris to have the GoldenEye satellite target London, as they activate the weapon. Eventually, Bond and Natalya are captured and brought before Alec. Boris is delighted to see Natalya, but she furiously slaps him and continues to attack until she is restrained by guards. He picks up Bond's explosive pen that had fallen to the ground and starts to click it. Natalya tells him of her disgust by his betrayal and that millions of people may die because of his sick games.
He furiously raises a clenched fist to her face, but Trevelyan stops him and sends Boris back to his computer to check whether Natalya has done any harm hacking before she was captured. Big-mouthed, Boris brags that Natalya does not have his skills and would be unable to hack into the GoldenEye. Boris' overconfidence is misplaced, as soon thereafter the alarms are activated, with Boris now stating that GoldenEye is about to re-enter Earth's atmosphere which would cause the satellite to ignite and explode, in twelve minutes' time. Boris tries to hack back into the system, viciously clicking the pen, whilst Bond counts the many times it is clicked, knowing that three clicks arm its grenade, whilst three more disarm it. Bond senses an opportunity and knocks the pen from Boris' hand which falls near the gasoline canister, causing it to blow up. Fuelled by the gasoline and the explosive charge Bond set earlier, the explosion destroys almost the entire control room. However, Boris' computer equipment survives. Alec dispatches a guard to kill Boris if he fails to break Natalya's code or tries to escape, and then sets off to hunt down Bond.
Eventually, Boris manages to access the system and resets the antenna. However, Bond, who has meanwhile reached the antenna, disables the mechanism by jamming a metal bar into the rotation belts, causing grave harm to the system. This eventually results in a giant explosion that destroys the remainder of the base and kills Trevelyan. Miraculously, Boris survives. Emerging from the ruins, he loudly exclaims that he's invincible. But he celebrates too soon as at the same moment, the canisters behind him that contain liquid nitrogen explode, covering and freezing Boris to death.
Boris was a featured character in the 1997 video game Goldeneye 007 for the Nintendo 64. He could be one of the eight main characters played in the multiplayer mode. He was featured in two stages. The first stage was the second mission, or Bond's first trip to Severnaya (a main difference from the film is that Bond never went to Severnaya). In the first stage he is known as ""Programmer"" and ""Boris"" in the second stage. Bond is ordered to capture Boris in Severnaya, then force Boris to disable the security so MI6 can hack the Severnaya database. (Boris dying or fleeing the Severnaya facility before Bond captures him would result in a failed mission.) If Bond succeeds at capturing Boris, he will do as Bond commands, however his tampering with the mainframe will sound the alarm, resulting in Bond having to fight multiple Soviet soldiers, although the mission will be successful.
Boris is mentioned again in the Train level, when Natalya tries to use the computer in Trevelyan's dining car to track him to Cuba. Boris makes his second and final appearance in Trevelyan's base, feigning innocence to Bond before attempting to pull a gun on him. Being utterly incompetent in firearms, Boris fumbles and drops it. He begs for his life, saying Trevelyan made him do it and then runs away shouting his catchphrase when Bond's back is turned. As in Severnaya, killing Boris results in mission failure; Natalya, still unaware of the depth of Boris' treachery, will refuse to help Bond further if he kills him, claiming that Boris was only a pawn of Trevelyan's and did not deserve death. In order for the mission to succeed, Bond must allow Boris to flee.
Though a brilliant computer programmer, Boris was also known to be perverse and perverted mostly by the way he used female body parts as his access codes and passwords and also shown to be full of arrogance and self-confidence especially when he shouted ""I am invincible"" whenever he succeeded in finishing a task.
He later became a backstabbing traitor having sided with Janus to steal a dangerous electronic satellite that was used to murder his fellow programmers at Severnaya to leave no witnesses of the theft.
He was shown to be friends with Natalya who saw him just as an annoying little brother and was a bit more patient with his wayward antics, but then her friendship with him turned to hatred when she realised he was partly responsible for the murder of Anna and all the other people at the Severnaya observatory as well as him being willing to kill more people for personal profit.
Perhaps because of his ego, Boris became somewhat unstable when he was confronted with a problem he couldn't solve.  When Natalya changed the codes to lock him out of the computer, he insisted he could fix it himself; when he failed to do so, he screamed in her face, demanding her codes.  Later, when the satellite, dish failed to respond to his commands (because Bond had sabotaged it), Boris devolved into manhandling the computer screen and screaming incoherently.

"
551,/wiki/False_fangs,"False fangs are a fictional assassination and coercion device designed to resemble vampiric fangs. They were designed and worn by members of Xerxes Xerophanos' secretive ""vampire cult"".  The weapon appeared in the James Bond comic strip, The League of Vampires, which ran in The Daily Express newspapers between October 25, 1972 and February 28, 1973.
Worn by a members of the hedonistic and secretive ""vampire cult"", the devices were used both to intoxicate potential recruits and conduct assassinations. On the slightest pressure, twin hypodermic needles popped out of the fangs. It was double-chambered to carry two drugs - a powerful poison and a psychedelic drug capable of inducing a hypnotic state. A light bite delivered the former, whereas a strong bite - hard enough to leave puncture marks - released poison. In addition, a fatal bite would trigger a concealed third needle which jabbed upward into the wearer's own palate and injected the psychedelic drug; making them conveniently suggestible to suicide orders.
"
552,/wiki/Ali_Kerim_Bey,"Ali Kerim Bey was Head of the British Secret Service's ""Station T"" in Istanbul and the deuteragonist of the 1963 James Bond film From Russia with Love. Portrayed by the late actor Pedro Armendariz, Kerim Bey was based on the character Darko Kerim from Ian Fleming's 1957 novel From Russia with Love. He would later appear with Armendariz' likeness and voiced by JB Blanc in Electronic Arts' 2005 video game adaptation of the film. The character would later be completely re-imagined for the 2015 mobile game James Bond: World of Espionage.
Kerim Bey was born in Trebizond, in north-eastern Turkey. His mother was an English governess and his father was a Turkish fisherman, famous for catching sword-fish. He was a ladies man, and so he had a large family with 15 children. The children lived a gypsy life-style and constantly argued. They lived almost on top of each other in a small, old ruin of a house. His father was strict and beat the kids if they were bad, to keep the family together.
When Kerim was 20, he got a boat of his own and made his money fishing, following in his father's footsteps. His father knew an Englishman who he sold information to, and Kerim went to work for him. The man turned out to be the Head of Station T, a Turkish intelligence branch that collaborates with MI6 and Kerim took over his position when he died. Before he got the position, Kerim had infiltrated a traveling circus, working as a strongman and wrestler. He had spied on the Russians, pretending he didn't know the language.
Tatiana Romanova had contacted him, saying that she wanted to defect to England. She had apparently seen a file photo of James Bond, and had taken a fancy to him. She said that she would hand over a Lektor decoding machine to Bond if he would go to Istanbul and take her and the machine back to England.
Kerim contacted M, who sent Bond out to meet him in Istanbul. Kerim sent a chauffeur to meet Bond at the airport, taking him back to Kerim's office to discuss the mission. Kerim said he smelt that something was fishy and that he didn't believe the girl. Bond went to rest at his hotel, and Kerim went to work at his desk. One of his 'girls' enticed him over to the sofa, and he narrowly missed an explosion caused by a limpet mine on the wall outside.
Kerim decided to spy on the Russians. He led Bond through a hidden door and down some steps into an underground reservoir that had been built by the Emperor Constantine around 350AD. They took a small boat down to a tunnel and walked through into a small cavity beneath the Russian Consulate building. Kerim had received a periscope from the British Navy, and had closed the Consulate to install it, claiming that the traffic was shaking the foundations. He spies a Military Intelligence meeting where there is the general Vassili, Koslovski, Commissar Benz and Krilencu, an assassin and a old enemy of Kerim.
Kerim decided to visit his friend Vavra to get some information about Krilencu. Bey went to Vavra's gypsy camp with Bond, but the evening didn't turn out as he had planned. Vida and Zora, two girls were in love with the same man and were to fight to the death. They were allowed to stay for the fight, and were given food and raki. The two girls had nearly killed each other when Krilencu and his men attacked the camp, injuring Kerim and nearly killing him. Kerim survives and says that he must kill him even after getting shot in the arm. Kerim decided to take immediate revenge, and he took Bond to Krilencu's street.
His plan was to get his sons to dress up as two policemen and ring the doorbell, causing Krilencu to escape out of his trapdoor around the back. Kerim was ready with Bond's sniper rifle, and he shot him dead, paying off many longstanding debts.
Kerim had an almost identical personality to Bond, which made Kerim an ally and a loyal friend. His interests and defects included an attraction for beautiful women, as well as smoking and drinking. Like Bond, he had the facility to humor from a situation, and also took his job very seriously, as has been shown, even if he is injured, he will continue to fight for the mission.

554,/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld_(Dynamite),"Circa 2021, Blofeld's leadership of the organisation was threatened by an internal coup led by the ambitious Number Seven, Titania Jones. In need of outside assistance to settle the civil war, the villain lured James Bond to Paris and, after subduing him, made the spy a proposition - to assassinate Jones in exchange for €15 million and the life of his CIA friend, Felix Leiter. Bond agreed and, after staging Leiter's death, approached Jones with a counter-offer, luring her to his Greek meeting with Blofeld in the hope that they would kill one another. Blofeld survived the resulting helicopter raid by Jones' faction and took Bond with him to his stronghold at Meraki; only to discover that Number Seven had bribed his own men into taking up arms against him. She confronted him in a suit of hi-tech armour, and after a firefight he managed to escape and trigger the self-destruction of the island. Aware of Bond's betrayal, Blofeld dispatched assassins on a doomed mission to finish Leiter, and returned to kill the recently incapacitated Jones as she surrendered herself (and incriminating information) to Bond.

555,/wiki/Heller,"Colonel Heller was a fictional Isthmian Military colonel and head of security for Franz Sanchez’s drug cartel. A major antagonist portrayed by American actor Don Stroud, he first appeared in the 1989 James Bond film, Licence to Kill, and was also featured in John Gardner's accompanying novelization.
Around the time of his brief incarceration by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Sanchez had arranged to buy four Stinger missiles (unidentified prototype missiles in the novelization) from the Contras; threatening to shoot down an American airliner if the DEA didn't back off. Felix Leiter gave Bouvier a letter at his wedding, granting Heller immunity if he got the Stingers back. He initially went for the deal, but panicked and reneged on the deal after Bond's failed assassination attempt on Sanchez's life. Preventing his inadvertent meddling in a narcotics investigation into Sanchez's activities, 007 is kidnapped by members of the Hong Kong Narcotics Agency and is taken to a secluded safe house. Their MI6 contact tries to sedate Bond for transport back to London, but the Isthmus military, under the command of Heller, attacks the house with a tank; killing the occupants and liberating a bound and unconscious 007 - assuming him to be an ally.
They bring him back to Sanchez's palatial residence, where the spy tricks Sanchez into believing the narcotics agents to be the assassins. Divulging his identity as a former British agent, he sets in motion a plan to frame one of the drug lord's associates, Milton Krest by planting $5 million of Sanchez's drug money in his ship, the Wavekrest. Having checked Bond's background, Heller confirms his identity and arranges Sanchez's meeting with Krest that evening. His men discover the incriminating money on-board the ship and he assists Sanchez in his murder of Krest via a decompression chamber. The following day Heller accompanies Sanchez, Bond and a group of Oriental business associates to the Cartel's main distribution center. There, 007's cover is blown and he sets fire to the narcotics laboratory. While being fed along a conveyor belt towards an industrial grinder, Bond directs Sanchez's paranoid attention to Heller's absence during the fire, stating ""That's the last you'll see of Heller and your Stingers"". The drug lord finds Heller in the middle of moving the Stingers from his helicopter, who claims that he was ""making sure they were secure"". Sanchez tells him to move the Stingers to his car, whilst looking knowingly at his enforcer Braun. Shortly thereafter, Heller is impaled on the forks of a forklift and rammed through a wall.

556,/wiki/El-Saghira_Temple,"The el-Saghira Temple, also known as by its mission name Egyptian, is the location of the last bonus mission in GoldenEye 007. It can be unlocked by completing all missions in 00 Agent difficulty and is playable in multiplayer mode but the map is slightly changed. 
The fictional temple is located in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. Though the level isn't based on any Bond films like the Aztec Complex, which is based on the film Moonraker, the elements of the level is based on the films Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun and The Spy Who Loved Me. The entire temple is filled with pillars, some of the walls have hieroglypics, a small pool, a water filed basement and a booby trap room with the Golden Gun. The key to getting the gun is step on the right tiles. If you step on the wrong tile, the bulletproof auto guns appear and you need to exit the room and start all over again. There is no start point and exit in the level.
MI6 received a letter from Baron Samedi, saying that he had stolen Scaramanga's Golden Gun and wants Bond to go to the el-Saghira Temple to retrieve it. Knowing this is to be a trap, regardless, Bond must go to the temple to recover the weapon. Samedi is not alone, for he had the help of Russian soldiers armed with  ZMGs. After getting the Golden Gun, Bond must face Samedi by defeating him three times with the Golden Gun. Samedi is armed with dual magic DD44 Dostoveis. The first time he shoots them as normal DD44 Dostoveis, the second time he shoots them as ZMG (9mm)s and the third time shoots them as Moonraker Laser Rifles.
After Bond apparently kills Samedi, he walks down through the corridors of the temple with the Golden Gun in tow and leaves the temple. Samedi appears and chases after him and begins to laugh.

He was still present with M and Damian Falco when Icarus attacked the demilitarized zone. They saved by James Bond when he killed Gustav Graves.
"
558,/wiki/Anatol_Alexis_Gogol,"Ministry of Foreign AffairsDespite the popular assumption about the James Bond series' Cold War focus, Gogol is never depicted as a true villain. At his most hostile, he is a respectful competitor and more often is an ally against the common foes of peace. His first appearance is in The Spy Who Loved Me, where he is seen sending Anya Amasova to recover an important roll of microfilm.
Later in the film, Gogol and James Bond's superior, M, form an alliance, which is the start of the Anglo-Soviet relationship as a result of their mutual pursuit of Karl Stromberg.
Gogol is seen next in Moonraker, talking to USAF Colonel Scott over the telephone about Hugo Drax's space station. He tells the Americans it is not a Soviet station and that they would investigate it themselves after the US had intercepted it. Colonel Scott apologizes for calling Gogol at a bad time due to the time differences, but Gogol says there is nothing to apologize over, as ""problems in Russia keep him awake"", just as he is seen with an attractive Russian woman in a nightgown.
In For Your Eyes Only, Gogol wants to buy an ATAC communicator from Aristotle Kristatos, after the ship carrying it is sunk in an accident. Kristatos recovers the unit and arranges a sale at his private headquarters, but Gogol arrives there just as Bond and his allies are going after Kristatos for the murders he has committed to retrieve the device. When Bond throws it off a cliff, Gogol is initially dismayed but keeps his guard from shooting Bond; as Bond notes that his actions maintain détente, Gogol chuckles as he acknowledges Bond's observation that the machine's destruction allows the nations to remain in their relatively peaceful status quo. The assistant of General Gogol, appearing briefly in For Your Eyes Only, is called Rubelvitch, a wordplay on the name Moneypenny.
In Octopussy, when General Orlov proposes invading the West, Gogol is the loudest voice opposing the reckless plan, asserting both the danger of provoking a nuclear war and that the USSR wants peace, not war. Gogol's investigations of Orlov's scheme to weaken NATO's defence runs parallel to Bond's, but his subordinates' unauthorized fatal shooting of the traitor prevents him from learning the full details of his plot and warning NATO, though Bond is able to stop Orlov's plan on his behalf, and later appears before M to inform him that his government will deny the incident and request that Bond return their treasure Romanov Star that he has in his possession which Orlov previously stole.
In A View to A Kill, Gogol in first seen in France. He reprimands Max Zorin, an erstwhile KGB agent, for killing 007 without the KGB's approval beforehand. Zorin thinks of himself as no longer part of the KGB. Gogol also learns of Operation Main Strike, and demands Zorin stop at once.
When Zorin defies the order to stop his plan, Gogol sends KGB agent Pola Ivanova to see what Zorin is up to. When Pola meets Bond, she tries to take the tape from him and give it to Gogol. Gogol is embarrassed that Pola got the wrong tape.
At the end of the film, Gogol awards Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's plan to destroy Silicon Valley, stating that Bond was the first non-Soviet citizen to receive it and that the KGB has its own heart of operations producing their own technology at Silicon Valley (being awarded this medal contradicts a statement in the novel Goldfinger that stated that people in the British Secret Service could not accept awards from foreign services, no matter how friendly (such as the CIA). However, Bond may not have accepted the award, and the Russians may have insisted he was awarded it anyway, whether he'd accepted the medal or not.)
In The Living Daylights, Gogol is mentioned as having retired from the KGB and his position being succeeded by General Pushkin, He is only seen in the end, as a diplomat in the Foreign Ministry. He attends Kara Milovy's concert with M, offering Milovy a visa which would allow her to leave the Eastern bloc at will.

559,/wiki/Della_Churchill_(Priscilla_Barnes),"During the pre-title sequence of Licence to Kill, Felix is on his way to marry Della when he unexpectedly learns that drug lord, Franz Sanchez, is in Florida. With the help of his Best Man, James Bond, Leiter pursues Sanchez and they return victorious. They parachute into the church and the wedding commences. At the reception, the bride and groom present 007 with a gift - an engraved cigarette lighter. Following the festivities she unintentionally references Bond's earlier short-lived marriage to Tracy Bond, unsettling him, and unintentionally foreshadowing her own fate. Leiter lifts her across the threshold of their bedroom only to be ambushed by two of Sanchez' henchmen. Their leader, Dario, steps out from behind the door and cudgels Leiter with his pistol. After killing Della in a manner suggestive of rape, the unconscious Felix is taken to a warehouse. Asking where is his wife, Dario mockingly informs him ""We gave her a nice honeymoooooon..."" Sanchez then lowers him into a shark tank. A visibly shaken Bond later finds Della, dead, on her bed, and soon swears to wreak havoc on the men responsible for her death and Felix's maiming.
In the 2020 anthology comic book published by Dynamite Entertainment, Della is mentioned by Leiter as his late wife and briefly appears in flashbacks. In this timeline, she lived long enough to mother two daughters, Cedar and Kelsey. Leiter divulged to Bond that after her death, his relationship with his daughters deteriorated. Her cause of death, however, was not disclosed.

While the first generation covered the 1969 and 1970 model years, the one used by James Bond and Tiffany Case is a 1971 model, making it brand new at the time of the filming. The car was provided by Ford.
In the past years, experts and enthusiasts managed to find some of the Mustangs used for filming Diamonds Are Forever, and some are on display. It appears that several different cars with different engines where used to film Diamonds Are Forever.
The Mustang Mach 1 is first driven by Tiffany, when Bond follows Prof. Metz into the Nevada deserts surrounding Las Vegas. After a security breach at Willard Whyte Tectronics, the car is wanted by law enforcement agency. 
Later that day, Bond has to evade capture by former Las Vegas Police Department forces, resulting in a car chase through Las Vegas. Bond manages to lose the cops by driving on two wheels through a narrow alley.
This scene shows one of the most famous movie mistakes, as Bond 'switches' the side he's driving on.

561,/wiki/7777,"Kissy SuzukiRoyal Navy Commander James Herbert Bond, CMG, RNVR, is a fictional character created by British journalist and novelist Ian Fleming in 1953. He is the main protagonist of the James Bond series of novels, films, comics and video games. Fleming wrote twelve Bond novels and two short story collections before his death, although the last two books — The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights — were published posthumously.
Since Fleming's death in 1964, there have been other authorised writers of Bond material, including John Gardner, who wrote fourteen novels and two novelizations and Raymond Benson, who wrote six novels, three novelizations and three short stories. There have also been five authors who wrote one book each, Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham), Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. Additionally a series of novels based on Bond's youth—Young Bond—was written by Charlie Higson and Steve Cole.
It was not until the penultimate novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background, using a fictional obituary, purportedly from The Times. The book was the second to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories.
At the start of Fleming's first book, Casino Royale, Bond is already a 00 agent having been given the position after killing two enemy agents, a Japanese spy on the thirty-sixth floor of the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center in New York City and a Norwegian double agent who had betrayed two British agents; it is suggested by Bond scholar John Griswold that these were part of Bond's wartime service with Special Operations Executive (SOE), a British World War II covert military organisation. In 1954, according to the Soviet file on him in From Russia, With Love, Bond is made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.
In Ian Fleming's stories, James Bond is in his mid-to-late thirties, but does not age. In Moonraker, he admits to being eight years shy of mandatory retirement age from the 00 section—forty-five—which would mean he was thirty-seven at the time. Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond, James Bond: The Authorised Biography of 007, gives him a birth date of 11 November 1920, whilst a study by Bond scholar John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921. According to Griswold, the Fleming novels take place between around May 1951, to February 1964, by which time Bond was aged 42.
Bond lives in a flat off the King's Road in Chelsea. His flat is looked after by an elderly Scottish housekeeper named May. May's name was taken from May Maxwell, the housekeeper of Fleming's close friend, the American Ivar Bryce. In 1955 Bond earned around £2,000 a year net (£47,321 in 2017 pounds), although when on assignment he worked on an unlimited expense account. Much of Fleming's own daily routine whilst working at The Sunday Times was woven into the Bond stories and he summarised it at the beginning of Moonraker:
Only once in the series does Fleming install a partner for Bond in his flat, with the arrival of Tiffany Case, following Bond's mission to the US in Diamonds Are Forever. By the start of the following book, From Russia, With Love, Case had left to marry an American. Bond was married only once, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, to Teresa ""Tracy"" di Vicenzo, but their marriage was short-lived as she was killed on their wedding day by Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
In the penultimate novel of the series, You Only Live Twice, Bond suffers from amnesia and has a relationship with an Ama diving girl, Kissy Suzuki. As a result of the relationship Kissy becomes pregnant, although she does not reveal this to Bond before he leaves the island.
In Never Send Flowers it is said that at some point in his life Bond visited Disney World with a girlfriend, intending to stay only two days, but liked the park so much that they had stayed for a whole week. Bond also showed that he recognized a great deal of Disney's characters.
Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies; Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist’s wife that ""It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born"". He further explained that:
On another occasion Fleming said: ""I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, ""James Bond"" was much better than something more interesting, like ""Peregrine Carruthers"". Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure—an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.""
Fleming based his creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, admitting that Bond ""was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war"". Amongst those types were his brother, Peter, who Fleming worshipped, and who had been involved in behind the lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war. Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including Conrad O'Brien-French, a skiing spy whom Fleming had met in Kitzbühel in the 1930s, Patrick Dalzel-Job, who served with distinction in 30 AU during the war, and Bill ""Biffy"" Dunderdale, station head of MI6 in Paris, who wore cufflinks and handmade suits and was chauffeured around Paris in a Rolls-Royce. Sir Fitzroy MacLean was another figure mentioned as a possibility, based on his wartime work behind enemy lines in the Balkans, as was the MI6 double agent Dušan Popov.

Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett noted that, ""within the first few pages [of Casino Royale] Ian had introduced most of Bond's idiosyncrasies and trademarks"", which included his looks, his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits. The full details of Bond's martini were kept until chapter seven of the book and Bond eventually named it ""The Vesper"", after Vesper Lynd.
Bond's drinking habits run throughout the series of books. During the course of On Her Majesty's Secret Service alone, Bond consumes forty-six drinks: Pouilly-Fuissé, Riquewihr and Marsala wines, most of a bottle of Algerian wine, some 1953 Château Mouton Rothschild claret, along with Taittinger and Krug champagnes and Babycham; for whiskies he consumes three bourbon and waters, half a pint of I.W. Harper bourbon, Jack Daniel's whiskey, two double bourbons on the rocks, two whisky and sodas, two neat scotches and one glass of neat whisky; vodka consumption totalled four vodka and tonics and three double vodka martinis; other sprits included two double brandies with ginger ale, a flask of Enzian Schnaps and a double gin: he also washed this down with four steins of German beer.
For his non-alcoholic drinks, Bond eschews tea, calling it ""mud"" and blaming it for the downfall of the British Empire. He instead prefers to drink coffee. Perferably Blue Mountain Jamaican coffee.
When in England and not on a mission, Bond dines as simply as Fleming did on dishes such as grilled sole, oeufs en cocotte and cold roast beef with potato salad. When on a mission, however, Bond eats more extravagantly. This was partly because in 1953, when Casino Royale was published, many items of food were still rationed, and Bond was ""the ideal antidote to Britain's postwar austerity, rationing and the looming premonition of lost power"". This extravagance was more noteworthy with his contemporary readers for Bond eating exotic, local foods when abroad, at a time when most of his readership did not travel abroad.
On 1 April 1958 Fleming wrote to The Manchester Guardian in defence of his work, referring to that paper's review of Dr. No. Whilst referring to Bond's food and wine consumption as ""gimmickery"", Fleming bemoaned that ""it has become an unfortunate trade-mark. I myself abhor Wine-and-Foodmanship. My own favourite food is scrambled eggs."" Fleming was so keen on scrambled eggs that he used his short story, ""007 in New York"" to provide his favourite recipe for the dish: in the story, this came from the housekeeper of his friend Ivar Bryce, May, who gave her name to Bond's own housekeeper.
Bond believes that a steak has a flavor of its own, and as such should not be eaten with anything on them, save for salt and pepper.

Bond is a heavy smoker, at one point smoking 70 cigarettes a day. Bond has his cigarettes custom-made by Morland of Grosvenor Street, mixing Balkan and Turkish tobacco and having a higher nicotine content than normal; the cigarettes have three gold bands on the filter. Bond carried his cigarettes in a wide gunmetal cigarette case which carried fifty; he also used a black oxidised Ronson lighter. The cigarettes were the same as Fleming's, who had been buying his at Morland since the 1930s; the three gold bands on the filter were added during the war to mirror his naval Commander's rank. On average, Bond smokes sixty cigarettes a day, although he cut back to around twenty five a day after his visit to a health farm in Thunderball. Fleming himself smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day. In Carte Blanche he is a former smoker.
Bond occasionally supplements his alcohol consumption with the use of other drugs, for both functional and recreational reasons: Moonraker sees Bond consumes a quantity of the amphetamine benzedrine accompanied by champagne, before his bridge game with Sir Hugo Drax (also consuming a carafe of vintage Riga vodka and a vodka martini); he also uses the drug for stimulation on missions, such as swimming across Shark Bay in Live and Let Die, or remaining awake and alert when threatened in the Dreamy Pines Motor Court in The Spy Who Loved Me. Despite this, in Devil May Care, set after the events of The Man wit the Golden Gun, Bond was offered raw Opium to smoke by Darius Alizadeh, but in order to keep his senses sharp for his mission he politely refused.
Facially, Bond resembles the composer, singer and actor Hoagy Carmichael. In Casino Royale Vesper Lynd remarks, ""Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless."" Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is ""certainly good-looking . . . Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold."" Others, such as journalist Ben Macintyre, identify aspects of Fleming's own looks in his description of Bond. General references in the novels describe Bond as having ""dark, rather cruel good looks"".
In the novels (notably From Russia, with Love), Bond's physical description has generally been consistent: slim build; a three-inch long, thin vertical scar on his right cheek; blue-grey eyes; a ""cruel"" mouth; short, black hair, a comma of which falls on his forehead. Physically he is described as 183 centimetres (6 feet) in height and 76 kilograms (167 lb) in weight. After Casino Royale, Bond also had the faint scar of the Russian cyrillic letter ""Ш"" (SH) (for Shpion: ""Spy"") on the back of one of his hands, carved by a SMERSH agent.
From Casino Royale to From Russia, with Love, Bond's preferred weapon is a .25 ACP Beretta automatic pistol carried in a light-weight chamois leather holster. However Fleming was contacted by a Bond enthusiast and gun expert, Geoffrey Boothroyd, who criticised Fleming's choice of firearm for Bond and suggested a Walther PPK 7.65mm instead. Fleming used the suggestion in Dr. No, also taking advice that it should be used with the Berns-Martin triple draw shoulder holster. By way of thanks, the MI6 Armourer who gives Bond his gun was given the name Major Boothroyd, and is introduced by M as ""the greatest small-arms expert in the world"".
Kingsley Amis, in The James Bond Dossier, noted that although Bond is a very good shot and the best in the Secret Service, he is still beaten by the instructor, something that added realism to Bond's character. Amis identified a number of skills where Bond is very good, but is still beatable by others. These included skiing, hand-to-hand combat, underwater swimming and golf. Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to write off his battleship-grey Bentley 4½ Litre with an Amherst Villiers supercharger. Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.
Whilst serving in the Naval Intelligence Division, Fleming had planned to become an author and had told a friend, ""I am going to write the spy story to end all spy stories."" On 17 February 1952, he began writing his first James Bond novel, Casino Royale at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, where he wrote all his Bond novels, during the months of January and February each year. He started the story shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend, Ann Charteris, in order to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials.
After completing the manuscript for Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, Jonathan Cape, who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother Peter, an established travel writer. Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books – The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights – published posthumously. All the books were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.
After Fleming's death a continuation novel, Colonel Sun, was written by Kingsley Amis (as Robert Markham) and published in 1968. Amis had already written a literary study of Fleming's Bond novels in his 1965 work, The James Bond Dossier. Although novelizations of two of the Eon Productions Bond films appeared in print, James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me and James Bond and Moonraker, both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood, the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s. In 1981, thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with Licence Renewed. Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote – Licence to Kill and GoldenEye – were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. In 1996, Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.
In 1996, American author Raymond Benson became the author of the Bond novels. Benson had previously been the author of The James Bond Bedside Companion, first published in 1984. By the time he moved on to other, non-Bond related projects in 2002, Benson had written six Bond novels, three novelizations and three short stories.
The Young Bond series of novels was started by Charlie Higson and, between 2005 and 2009, five novels and one short story were published. The first Young Bond novel, SilverFin was also adapted and released as a graphic novel on 2 October 2008 by Puffin Books. Beginning in 2014, the series was revived by Random House under new author Steve Cole, who wrote an additional four novels up to 2017.

562,/wiki/General_Arkady_Ourumov_(,"General Arkady Ourumov is commander of the Russian Space Division, a member of the Janus Syndicate and one of the primary villains in the 2010 James Bond video-game GoldenEye 007. He was portrayed by Laurence Possa, who would also provide the voice of Stefan Pomerov in the video-game Blood Stone.
In the 2010 remake of GoldenEye 007, General Ourumov has a broader bodily frame, shorter hair and wears dark grey military clothing instead of green. MI6 discovers that Ourumov has been receiving large cash transfers that trace back to a Nigerian shell corporation, the Janus Group. At the start of the game, Bond and Trevelyan (006) are briefed by M on their infiltration of the Arkangelsk Chemical Weapons Facility, commandeered by Ourumov. The general himself had been stealing Russian military equipment and selling it on the black market, and he plans to sell a sample of high-tech weapons to a terrorist organization arriving on that day.
Bond and Trevelyan sneak into the facility and Bond eventually plants timed explosives on a number of fuel tanks, but later discovers that Ourumov has captured Trevelyan and has him at gunpoint. Ourumov threatens to kill Trevelyan if Bond does not throw down his weapon, but Bond takes refuge behind a stack of fuel canisters. One of Ourumov's soldiers tries to shoot Bond, but the general tells him not to for the fear of blowing them up. After a second soldier tries to fire at Bond, Ourumov shoots them. Bond eventually drops his gun and raises his hands, but Ourumov shoots Trevelyan anyway, then walks towards Bond to eliminate him as well. Before he can fire though, Bond sets off the timed explosives on the fuel tanks and catches Ourumov and his soldiers off guard, giving Bond the chance to escape.
Following the destruction of the Arkangelsk Facility and the loss of Janus' EMP hardened helicopter, Ouromov attempts to procure a second helicopter via Russian gangster Valentin Zukovsky. Zukovsky points him in the direction of the annual Dubai arms fair. Ourumov and Xenia enter Dubai using fake passports, murder the head of security at the arms fair, Sky Briggs, and attempt to steal the EMP-hardened helicopter being unveiled onboard the carrier. Bond tries to stop them but fails.
When Bond and Natalya Simonova are being interrogated by Defence Minister Dmitri Mishkin in the Archives level, Ourumov bursts into the room fearing Bond will reveal too much information about him and his plans. Therefore, he kills Mishkin and frames Bond for the murder, then takes Natalya hostage before leaving the archives. Bond manages to escape from Mishkin's guards, and as Ourumov makes off with Natalya in his car, Bond hijacks a tank and chases the general through the streets of St. Petersburg. After causing much destruction, Bond eventually reaches a station where Ourumov takes Natalya on board a train. Just before it leaves, Bond drives the tank into one of the carriages and derails it, then deals with a great number of Ourumov's soldiers.
After eventually boarding the train, Bond confronts Ourumov and Xenia Onatopp in one of the carriages. Ourumov arrogantly taunts Bond, thinking that this time he will not escape, and Xenia then asks him for the GoldenEye controller. The general claims that this was not part of their plan, that he was supposed to give the controller to Alec Trevelyan, and therefore refuses, at which point Xenia uses the gun she is holding to fire a single shot into Ourumov's heart, killing him. Ourumov's body is incinerated when Xenia Onatopp blows up the train.

563,/wiki/Baron_Sharck%27s_Villa,"Baron Sharck's Villa was the fictional residence of Soviet spymaster, Baron Sharck. The 3-storey châteauesque building was situated on the French Riviera in the south of France. The location appeared in the James Bond comic strip, Trouble Spot, which ran in The Daily Express newspapers between December 28, 1971 and June 10, 1972.
Surrounded by high walls and wooded landscape, Baron Sharck's villa was an opulent 3-storey châteauesque building. In addition to the Baron's study and communications room, the building had a large wine cellar which, due to its soundproof properties, doubled as a torture room.
The villa was used as Sharck's base of operations during his mission to recovering a box containing the skull of double-agent, Piotr Vassilyevitch Grigorov. Sharck sent his subordinates to collect James Bond (impersonating deceased spy, Mike Channing) at gunpoint and bring him to the villa for interrogation. He also secretly arranged for the kidnapping of the dead man's girlfriend, Gretta. Sharck immediately recognised 007 and attempted to extract the location of the Box from him; threatening to have the sadistic Olga whip Channing's kidnapped girlfriend. Fortunately for 007, the girl's abduction drew the attention of the local police; creating an opportunity for the pair to escape and subdue their captors.

During the tunnel chase in the movie thugs by Fatima Blush are armed with Beretta 93Rs when they try to force Bond into a truck. This was also the first screen appearance of the 93R in an English-language film
The Beretta 93 is another pistol that appears in 007: Legends under the name ""Kunara V"". It has a 18 round magazine and fires in 3 round bursts.
The Beretta 93 also appears in GoldenEye 007 (2010) and GoldenEye 007: Reloaded under the same name, ""Kunara V"".  The Beretta has a 21 bullet clip, though this can be increased to 26 with ""high capacity magazine"" gadget. It is a trusty sidearm, deadly in close quarters combat with its fully automatic firing mode, though it defaults to a 3 round burst mode that conserves ammo and cuts down on recoil. It is quick to reload, a common trait in these games for handguns.
It is a rare find in the single player and occasionally can be found with a laser sight, and even less frequently, a silencer. It can be equipped with either of these accessories in Reloaded's online play, but handguns can not be equipped with attachments in the GoldenEye (2010) version. In the online of both games, it is the fourth pistol unlocked at rank 31 in GoldenEye 007 (2010) and at rank 38 in GoldenEye 007: Reloaded.

565,/wiki/Dryden,"Dryden was the fictional corrupt MI6 section chef in Prague, Czech Republic. He was killed by James Bond on his last mission before becoming a 00 Agent. Dryden was James Bond's second kill, after his contact, Fisher. The character appeared only in the pre-title sequence of EON Productions' 2006 film, Casino Royale, and was portrayed by British actor, Malcolm Sinclair.
Dryden was a former section chief of MI6's station in Prague. He quickly came to the attention of M for selling official secrets to an unknown source. Consequently, M sends James Bond - a candidate for 00 status - to investigate Dryden and his contact. Bond tracks Dryden's contact Fisher to a cricket match in Lahore, Pakistan. After attempting to flee, Fisher is cornered by Bond in a restroom and following a violent scuffle is shot dead; marking Bond's first official kill.
Returning to Prague, Bond investigates Dryden's office - finding evidence of his misdeeds in the safe. Dryden returns late to find the safe door ajar and Bond waiting for him in the shadows. Taking a seat, Dryden reaches for a concealed firearm whilst confidently exchanging pleasantries with Bond.
Believing him not to be a threat, Dryden notes that if M had been certain about his traitorous activity, she would have sent a ""00"" to confront him. Having access to Bond's personnel file, he gloats that he lacks the two required kills of a ""00."" Bond infers that he is well aware of this; a fact which unnerves Dryden. He suddenly realizes that Bond has assassinated his contact and stealthily grabs his firearm from the open drawer.
He trains the pistol on Bond and pulls the trigger. But to no avail, since Bond had removed the magazine beforehand. Realizing that he is about to become the spy's second kill, he inquires into how his contact died. Bond replies ""not well."" Sympathizing with Bond, perhaps in a desperate attempt to persuade him out of pulling the trigger, Dryden remarks that even though the first kill was uncomfortable, the second would be considerably easier. Before he finishes the sentence, Bond coldly shoots him dead. As the man falls backwards from his chair a family photo-frame briefly comes into sight, showing that Dryden had been married with a young daughter. As Bond puts away his gun and leaves, he answers Dryden's remark with ""Yes. Considerably"".
In an extended cut of the confrontation scene between Dryden and Bond, the section chief asks ""you're not a cricket fan, are you?"" in response to the spy's subtle hint that he was responsible for the death of his contact, confirming that Dryden was aware of Fisher's assassination in Lahore.

566,/wiki/Dexter_Smythe_(film),"After a brilliant military career, Major Dexter Smythe joined the British Secret Service. He was sent on a mission to locate a cache of Chinese gold, seized in North Korea. Smythe and his local guide never returned and the gold remained ostensibly lost — stolen by the Major himself. He subsequently devoted himself to to the study of octopi, becoming a leading authority on the subject. His enthusiasm was such that he nicknamed his daughter ""Octopussy"". When her father's gold ran out, the people in Hong Kong who'd disposed of it for him offered her a commission to smuggle diamonds. Discovering that she had a talent for it, she followed in Smythe's illicit footsteps and went into business as a smuggler. Two decades after the gold affair, the corpse of Smythe's native guide was discovered, with a bullet inside his skull matching the Major's service revolver. The Service dispatched James Bond to search for Smythe, whom he tracked down to Sri Lanka. He gave Smythe 24 hours to tidy up his affairs before returning for him; during which time Smythe committed suicide rather than face the disgrace of a court martial.

570,/wiki/Darko_Kerim_(Literary),"Darko Kerim (also referred to as Kerim Bey, where Bey is the equivalent of the English ""Mister"") was the fictional Head of the British Secret Service's ""Station T"" in Istanbul and a prominent ally of James Bond. The character appears in the 1957 Ian Fleming novel From Russia, with Love and was subsequently adapted for the 1963 EON Productions film of the same name, as well as several other portrayals.
Darko Kerim was born into a large polygamous family of 15 children in Trezibond (now Trabzon) to a Turkish father, a famed sword-fish fisherman, and an English mother, a governess. At the age of twenty he too was a fisherman, and was recruited into the British Secret Service by a Major Dansey, the previous head of Station T, who wanted information about the Russian oil installations and naval base at Batoum, only 50 miles away. He later infiltrated Soviet Georgia as a strongman and wrestler in a travelling circus.
He became Head of Station T in Istanbul in the late 1930s. M clearly has a great respect for Kerim and notes that he is one of the best men in the service; a respect which is returned by Darko and his sons. He uses his many sons and uncles as agents, running a profitable business trading spices as cover. In his office Bond notices certificates showing that he has two Mentions in Dispatches and the military OBE. He is described as 6 feet 2 inches (1.88m) tall, powerfully built, dark, with a broken nose and a small thin gold ring wore in the lobe of his right ear. He smokes Diplomates Turkish cigarettes (naturally), and has an insatiable appetite for raw food, coffee, alcohol, and women.
He meets Bond and arranges for false papers in order for Bond and Tatiana Romanova to leave the country. Later he takes Bond through a rat-infested tunnel to a periscope he had installed below the Russian Embassy. This gives Bond his first look at Tatania. He then takes Bond to the Gipsy Camp (also used by Kerim as agents) where they witness the girl-fight, before being attacked by ""The Faceless Ones"", Bulgarian thugs employed by the Russians.
Afterwards Kerim (with Bond's help) kills Krilencu, leader of the Bulgars, with a sniper rifle concealed in a walking stick, as the Bulgarian attempts to leave his apartment using an escape hatch hidden behind a film poster. He then accompanies Bond and Tatania on the train out of Turkey. He arranges for two of the three MGB men following Bond to be arrested, but is stabbed to death by the third as he slept, killing his assassin in the process. Finding him dead in his carriage, Bond laments to himself, ""this wonderful man who had carried the sun with him. Now he was extinguished, totally dead."" Kerim's sons would later detonate a bomb under the Russian Embassy, avenging their father's death.

Under his own name, he adapted two James Bond novels for the screen: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977 with Richard Maibaum) and Moonraker (1979).
Wood has written many novels. His novels divide into four groups: semi-autobiographical literary fiction, historical fiction, adventure novels, and pseudonymous humorous erotica.
Wood's first brush with Bond was in 1976 when, along with Richard Maibaum, was tasked to write the final draft of The Spy Who Loved Me.
Given that the film was a completely original story, Gildrose comissioned Maibaum a novelization of his scritp which was released as James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me. 
Two years later Wood returned to the world of Bond again crafting the screenplay for the next film Moonraker. Once more he was comssioned by Gildrose to adapt his screenplay into a novelization under the name James Bond and Moonraker.

The 750i (and iL) came with a 5.4 L V12 346 hp (258 kW; 351 PS) engine, as was used in the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph. Both variants had a five-speed automatic gearbox.
Features of the BMW 750iL included high-pressure headlight washers, auto-levelling xenon HID headlamps (The E38 was the first car in the world to feature Xenon headlights), power moonroof, a sound system with 14 speakers and four subwoofers as well as 6-disc CD changer and rain-sensing wipers. BMW was also the first European car manufacturer to offer an integrated satellite navigation screen which featured on the E38 7 Series. The E38 was also the first generation of 7 series to be available with the option of a diesel, was the first BMW to have televisions fitted , the first to have a five speed automatic gearbox and the first car ever to be fitted with curtain airbags.
Other features included an automatic climate control system with separate controls for the driver and passenger, a three-position memory system for the driver’s seat, safety-belt height, new steering wheel and outside mirrors. Front-seat side airbags and a Head Protection System (HPS) were also standard. The 750iL featured an all-leather interior with burl walnut trim. The continuous-motion Active Comfort Seat technology was introduced in 1998 to improve comfort and reduce fatigue for the driver and front passenger.
The BMW 750iL was Bond's provided vehicle for the 18th James Bond feature film Tomorrow Never Dies (1997). Used during sequences set in Germany, the car came equipped with a security system that sprayed tear gas and delivered electric shocks to intruders. The vehicle also came equipped with a fingerprint-protected safe hidden behind the passenger airbag compartment. The 750iL could be controlled remotely via Bond's Ericsson cell phone, which flipped open to reveal an LCD display and trackpad. Defense mechanisms included a roof-mounted rocket launcher, self-sealing and re-inflating tyres, a cable cutting device in the front bonnet emblem and a caltrop dispenser under the rear bumper.
During a chase sequence in the Atlantic Hotel parking garage, its windshield (despite able to withstand sledgehammer blows) and rear window are shot out by a combination of grenades and assault rifle gunfire from Elliot Carver's henchmen who were at the wheel of two Mercedes S Classes, an Opel Senator Mk2 and a Ford Scorpio Mk1. Bond eventually eludes the thugs and drives the 750iL off the roof of the garage via remote control. The car ironically ends up crashing into an Avis car rental store at street level. In a deleted scene, while leaving Bond made the excuse ""Left the keys in the car"" to the civilians.
Seventeen vehicles were used during filming of the German scenes. Four were adapted to be 'hidden driver' cars, in which a concealed driver would sit in the back using a small steering wheel. Video monitors were attached to cameras hidden in the wing mirrors and on top of the windscreen. Three more BMW's were used as backup for the hidden drivers. One car was equipped with the sliding glove compartment revealing a safe and only used for this one scene. Another, dubbed the 'cannon', was specially prepared to be propelled off the roof in the car chase's climax. It was stripped off as much weight as possible in order to be fired from a special rig. The remaining seven 'pristine' cars were used only for back-up and exterior shots, including one that was being kept in Hamburg for shooting there.

574,/wiki/007_Fan_films,"Fan generated content. As with many franchises, the James Bond franchise has encouraged numerous fans projects. These projects often include creation of written works (fictional, fan fictional and review literature), visual or computer-assisted art, music, or applied arts and costuming.
Fangames are video games made by fans based on one or more established video games. Many fangames attempt to clone or remake the original game's design, gameplay and characters, but it is equally common for fans to develop a unique game using another only as a template. Though the quality of fangames has always been variable, recent advances in computer technology and in available tools have made creating high-quality games easier.
A fan film is a film or video inspired by a film, television program, comic book or a similar source, created by fans rather than by the source's copyright holders or creators. Fan filmmakers have traditionally been amateurs, but some of the more notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in quality, as well as in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to full-length motion pictures.
There have been many James Bond Podcasts over the years since Podcasting came to the fore, but undoubtedly one of the biggest is James Bond Radio .
Formed in 2014 and hosted by James Bond fans Tom Sears and Chris Wright, the podcast has become extremly popular with Bond fans around the World, and has resulted in multiple gatherings of the ""JBR Army"" as they like to refer to themselves as.
The format of the show is fortnightly and discussion based, mainly Tom & Chris' in depth look at, and love of, the films, but over the 150+ episodes they have had notable interviews including Sir Roger Moore, Terry Bamber, Caroline Munro, Madeline Smith, Peter Lamont, Alan Tomkins , Bruce Glover  and Martine Beswick.
In 2016, James Bond Radio added a monthly ""Music of Bond"" podcast, hosted by Warren Ringham (of Q The Music Show) and John Williams.  In addition a reguar feature is wonderfully contructed episode ""featurettes"" from Dan Gale.
The popularity of the show, and undoubted expertise of hosts Tom & Chris have led to some notable media exposure including The Times, TalkSport Radio and BBC Radio 2.
Other noteable James Bond podcasts include BondCast, Being James Bond, Now Playing: The James Bond Movie Retrospective and James Bonding.
Additionally, Diminishing Returns is a general film show featuring James Bond Reviewer, Calvin Dyson, that is making its way through the entire Bond catalogue. Most episodes contain references or comparisons to James Bond.
Q The Music Show is a Tribute Show created by professional Trumpet player Warren Ringham as a tribute to the music from the James Bond Films.
Created in 2004, the group have become well known for their authentic and exciting performances of all the Bond Theme songs, as well as performing many of the series' incidental cues such as ""Bond '77"" or ""Backseat Driver"".
The group have appeared at fan events such as Bondstars and On The Tracks Of 007 and are generally regarded by the James Bond fans and fan organisations that have seen them as the greatest musical tribute to the films. At Bondstars they appeared at a celebration of the work of Peter Lamont, finishing with a rousing finale with Peter joining Q The Music on stage.
Regular supporters include Terry Bamber, who has worked on 7 James Bond films, as well as Caroline Munro and Madeline Smith.

576,/wiki/1948_Maserati_4CL,"In the late 1930s, continued rapid development in the increasingly competitive international voiturette class, and the introduction of the Alfa Romeo 158 and ERA B- and C-type models, forced the Maserati brothers into designing a new, square-bore, inline-4-cylinder engine. This new engine developed 30–50 bhp more than the previous inline-6, the increase mostly achieved through an increase to four valves per cylinder, coupled to the use of a more powerful supercharger and a small increase in the compression ratio. Following customary Maserati practice, the engine was mounted into a chassis design almost identical to that of the 4CL's predecessor: the Maserati 6CM. Conventional in its architecture, twin box-section spars ran the length of the car joined, ladder-fashion, by smaller cross members, although the 4CL design did incorporate more aluminium componentry than its forebear. Although near-identical in its wheelbase, the 4CL's track was a full 5 cm (1.97 in) wider than the 6CM, and sat lower thanks to repositioned spring hangers.
Ian Fleming's character James Bond was to drive one in the TV James Bond episode Murder On Wheels (it was never made and abandoned after the films success). However he drives one in the Anthony Horowitz 2015 James Bond novel Trigger Mortis .
In Fleming's original unpublished notes, Bond is at the Nürburgring in Germany, the infamous race track to stop SMERSH agents from deliberately sabotaging a race which will kill the British race car driver Stirling Moss and make it look like an unfortunate accident . He is trained to drive the Maserati by a female racer to tackle the course and he eventually defeats the agent by making him lose control of his vehicle and saves Moss's life.

The character, spelled ""Aubergene"", was subsequently adapted for the 1983-87 tabletop role-playing game James Bond 007.
Aubergine was hired by the French Jockey Club to look into the possibility that Max Zorin may be involved in a horse-fixing scheme. Looking for a lead, James Bond has lunch with Aubergine at the Eiffel Tower in Paris. As ""Dominique and the Enchanted Papillons"" perform during the meal, Aubergine informs 007 that the Sûreté (French National Police) has no information on Zorin prior to his arrival from East Germany. Bond asks if Zorin could be using drugs to improve his horses, only to be told that nothing had showed up in the tests. After informing Bond that Zorin will hold an annual sale at his stud near Paris later that month, he is suddenly murdered by May Day using a poison-barbed butterfly prop.

579,/wiki/Giulietta_da_Vinci,"Giulietta da Vinci (listed in the film credits as Cigar Girl) was a fictional assassin under the employ of the terrorist, Renard. She appeared in the 1999 James Bond film, The World Is Not Enough, and its accompanying novelization penned by Raymond Benson. The character was portrayed by Italian actress, Maria Grazia Cucinotta, and was doubled by stuntwoman Sarah Donohue.
Bond overpowers Lachaise's bodyguards and holds him at gunpoint. Just as Bond is about to get the name of an assassin, Lachaise is killed by a thrown knife in his neck by an escaping Giulietta. Bond and the Cigar Girl both escape from the building.

In a deleted scene of the film, we find that Giulietta is actually working for Renard, and she reveals that Bond on the case. Renard gives her the task of taking him out, and says that he trusts she won't let him down. She was also told to allow Bond to escape the original attack in Spain, so that the bomb would be delivered to MI6 headquarters. Bond returns to MI6 headquarters in London, England in order to return the money to Sir Robert King. However, the money was actually a fertilizer bomb which kills King and blows a hole in the wall of the building. Through a hole in the wall, 007 spots Giulietta, who is watching the building from a Sunseeker boat on the River Thames. The assassin is wearing a red leather body suit with a zipper down the front. She uses a machine gun to fire at Bond and then takes off down the Thames, with Bond pursuing in a prototype Q-boat.
An elaborate chase takes place along the Thames, and it ends at the Millennium Dome. Giulietta uses a grenade launcher as well. Just as two torpedoes are about to blow up her boat, she beaches her boat near the Millennium Dome, and jumps onto a hot air balloon basket. Bond follows closely by, and jumps to catch the mooring ropes to the balloon. Bond offers her protection from her real boss, but she refuses, asserting that Bond cannot protect her from ""him"". Giulietta then commits suicide by shooting the aircraft's gas tank, causing the balloon to explode in a huge fireball. Bond releases from the rope and falls onto the roof of the Millennium Dome, hurting his shoulder on the landing. This injury hampers him throughout the rest of the film. We later learn in the film that she was working for Renard or his full name, Victor Zokas. Giulietta was hired to keep an eye on Mr. Lachaise.
In the novel adaptation of The World Is Not Enough, then-current Bond novelist Raymond Benson gave the Cigar Girl a name: Giulietta da Vinci, and retained a scene between her and Renard in Bilbao that was cut from the theatrical release.

It is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family, although they have minority ownership.
Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914 these methods were known around the world as Fordism. Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000 respectively, were sold to Tata Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010. In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States since 1938.
Ford is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker and the fifth-largest in the world based on 2010 vehicle sales. At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth largest automaker in Europe.

585,/wiki/Canine_Caper_(episode),"Canine Caper was the forty-ninth episode of the 1991 animated television series, James Bond Jr, produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation. Written by Francis Moss and Ted Pedersen, the episode first aired on US television on 21st November 1991. The story was subsequently adapted into Caryn Jenner's 1993 children's book, Tunnel of Doom.
The episode begins with defence expert, Bernard Chaplan, being chased by the criminal organisation, S.C.U.M., whilst walking his dog. Before they can abduct him he fastens microfilm to the animal's collar and sends him away. The dog subsequently follows a reluctant James Bond Jr. back to Warfield Academy; where his friends quickly take a liking to the animal. Their attempts to hide the dog, who they have named ""Charlie"", fail and Bond incurs the wrath of Principal Milbanks. With the help of Buddy Mitchell, the students discover the microfilm and determine it to be security plans for Scotland Yard. They decide to return to the point of his abduction and use Charlie (who has been outfitted with a tracking device by I.Q.) to search for him.
There is a seemingly false alarm, as the dog enthusiastically runs up to a blonde lady named Heather; who mysteriously pulls out a two-way radio after the students leave. Shortly afterwards, Charlie follows a scent to a van driven by Skullcap and is abducted. Bond, Gordo and I.Q. jump into his sports-car and use the tracking device to follow the van to London. Realising that the microfilm is missing, mad scientist, Dr. Derange, orders his henchmen to release Charlie - hoping to lure Bond and the film back to his lair in the London Underground. His intuition proves correct and the students fall for the trap. Derange intends to use the plans to break into Scotland Yard and destroy it using an acid bomb. They are taken captive and held in a locked railway carriage alongside Chaplan.
Locked inside the carriage, Bond uses a holographic projection to distract the guards and pulls a brake lever outside with his electromagnetic belt-buckle. The carriage slides backward along the track and crashes through a wall; freeing the prisoners. At the same time, Heather - Chaplan's daughter and an undercover police officer - arrives with police reinforcements. His plans foiled, Derange attempts to exact vengeance upon Bond by trying to melt the students with a large beaker of acid; but is prevented by Charlie, who makes him drop the container. Derange flees and it is revealed that the dog's real name is ""Regis"". Back at Warfield, Bond admits that the animal has grown on him.

586,/wiki/Aris_Kristatos,"Aristotle ""Aris"" Kristatos (In Greek: Αριστοτέλης Κριστάτος) was a fictional Greek heroin smuggler, intelligence operative and rival of Milos Columbo. He was hired by KGB to obtain the ATAC device. Based on Kristatos from Ian Fleming's short story ""Risico"", he was the hidden main antagonist in EON Productions' 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by British actor Julian Glover and also appeared in the comic adaptation by Marvel Comics.
Aris Kristatos comes from the island of Kefalonia. Generally regarded as a hero for his bravery in World War II and the Greek Civil War, which the British government awarded him the King's Medal, Kristatos was actually a double agent during both conflicts. Though he appeared to be a respectable businessman in the years thereafter, he was in fact a heroin smuggler and a Soviet agent. At one point he worked with another smuggler, Milos Columbo, whom the latter remarked ""then, we were like brothers"". However, as time passed the two smugglers came to argue about what was to be smuggled. Columbo had smuggled commodites such as oil and almonds as they were in high demand and he believed ordinary people were hurt by the crushing tariffs of EU nations, and was later appalled when he discovered Kristatos was involved in heroin and white slavery. He is in union with rogue Nazi supporters who have aided him in smuggling gold, drugs and other supplies out of Britain. In the film, he is hired by General Anatol Alexis Gogol to obtain the British device ATAC (Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator); a device which controls and co-ordinates Britain's nuclear submarine fleet.
While operating in the Ionian Sea, the British spy ship St. Georges is sunk by an old mine hauled up in its fishing nets. The ship was equipped with ATAC. As the waters were too shallow to cover the wreck, the British government ruled out an official salvaging operation. Marine archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock, is hired by the British Secret Service to locate the wreck of the St. Georges. In a bid to steal the ATAC and deliver it to the Soviets, Kristatos has Havelock murdered by Cuban hitman Hector Gonzales; attracting the attention of James Bond and Havelock's vengeful daughter Melina.
Sent to Cortina on his search for his henchman Emile Locque, Bond meets with Italian MI6 agent Luigi Ferrara. The man tells him that he set up a meeting with Kristatos, who could possibly help them.
Bond meets Kristatos at the olympic ice rink, as well as his niece Bibi Dahl, a young iceskating champion who is tipped to be a future Olympic gold medalist. Kristatos introduces them to Bibi and her trainer Jacoba Brink. Bibi then asks Kristatos whether Bond can accompany her skiing later, and Kristatos persuades Bond, telling him that he would feel better knowing that someone was with her. After Bibi has left, Bond hands Kristatos a picture of Locque and asks whether Kristatos knows the man. Kristatos identifies him as Locque and tells Bond and Ferrara that he is the right-hand man of Milos Columbo. Kristatos tells the both agents about his and Columbo's past, stating that they were once close as brothers. He also tells them that Columbo's alias is The Dove. When Bond and Ferrara take their leave, he fails to shake Ferrara's hand, deeming the man too unimportant.
While Bond is skiing with Bibi, he is watched by Locque and Kristatos' other henchman Erich Kriegler, who are waiting for an opportunity to kill Bond. Though Bond eventually separates from Bibi, his men are unable to kill the agent. Kristatos eventually has Ferrara killed by Locque, and, by leaving a dove pin on the body, makes it seem like it was Columbo's work.
Bond meets Kristatos again at a casino in Greece. There, he tells Bond that he has been thinking about why Bond wanted to know about Locque. Knowing that Locque works for Columbo, who is a heroin smuggler, Kristatos tells Bond that he has deduced that Bond is from the British Narcotics Board and Bond leaves him in this fallacy. Sensing the opportunity to get rid off his opponent, Kristatos tells Bond that he might have to kill Columbo to stop him. Pointing at a different table, he shows Bond Columbo, who is been sitting there with his mistress Lisl von Schlaf. Unbeknownst to both of them, their coversation is by Columbo.
When Columbo seemingly insults his mistress, causing her to make a scene and leave the club, Bond tells Kristatos that this might be an opportunity to get information. Kristatos responds that it might be a trap, secretly worried that Columbo might have staged it to make contact with Bond. When Bond insists to follow Lisl, Kristatos tells him to take his car. However, once Bond is gone he calls Locque and tells him to kill both.
While being attacked by Locque and his henchman Claus, Bond is saved by Columbo's men, who kill everyone except Locque, who escapes. Columbo's henchmen then bring Bond to Columbo, who reveals that Kristatos lied to him. All Kristatos said about Columbo was actually about himself - Locque works for him, he is working for the Russians and he is the one to smuggle heroin. To prove that he tells the truth, Columbo proposes that they break into Kristatos' warehouse at Albania at night, the warehouse where he is storing his heroin. There, Columbo is proven right. During the ambush, the warehouse is blown up and Locque is killed by Bond.
When Bond, who with Melina's help has found the wreckage of the ship containing the ATAC, dives down there to get the ATAC, a silent alarm is triggered that tells Kristatos that there are intruders down at the ship. He sends a henchman in a special diving suit, which can be used even in high pressure, who attacks Bond while Bond defuses the mechanism that would lead to the ATAC's destruction. However, Bond is able to defeat him and blows him up with the explosive that was previously rigged to the ATAC. When Bond and Melina get back to the surface, they find that Kristatos and his henchman have taken over their ship. Kristatos thanks them for disarming the device. When Bond tells him that the MI6 will double whatever the Russians are paying him, Kristatos tells him that he never goes back on a deal, as this would hurt his reputation. Kriegler then tells Kristatos that he will deliver the ATAC to the KGB and return with the money, but Kristatos states that their deal was that he would turn the ATAC over at a location of his chosing. He tells Kriegler that he will deliver it to the KGB at St. Cyrils, a clifftop monastery. To get rid of Bond and Melina, he ties them together and binds them to the rear of his yacht, dragging them behind through the water, planning for them to get eaten by the sharks or impaled on the corals. However, Bond and Melina dive down and bind tie the rope around a rock, eventually severing it. Realizing that Bond got free, Kristatos tells the captain to turn the ship around to run them down. To evade death, Melina and Bond dive down to a site where Melina dived earlier and use the air canister she left there to stay underwater long enough to make Kristatos believe that they died.
To find out where this St. Cyrils, of which Kristatos spoke earlier, is located, Bond meets with Columbo, which is a remote monastery on a high clifftop at Greece. Awaiting the arrival of General Gogol, Kristatos is furious when he realises that his niece, Bibi, seems to have grown to despise him. Thinking that Jacoba Brink turned her against him, he tells Brink that he will deal with her as he deals with everyone who betrays him, before storming out of the room. Planning a bigger future, Bibi and Brink plan their escape, but Kristatos finds out. While she tries to get out, Brink stumbles upon Bond, Columbo and his men, who have arrived at the monastery to get the ATAC back. Ultimatly betraying Kristatos for Bibi, she leads the intruders to the guard chambers, where they overpower Kristatos' men, and tells them where Kristatos is.
Meanwhile, Bibi demands from Kristatos to know where Brink is, believing that Kristatos has harmed or killed her. Fed up with the behaviour of his niece, he hits her. Hearing the arriving helicopter of General Gogol prevents him from harming her further. However, before the helicopter lands, Bond, who has been in a fistfight with one of Kristatos' men, falls through the window into the main room, causing Kristatos to realise that he did survive. While Bond engages in a fight with Kriegler, Kristatos takes the attack and flees outside, to hand it over to Gogol. Kristatos rushes towards the helicopter, but is attacked by Columbo. While on the ground, Kristatos drops the ATAC and tries to reach it, but Bond picks it up before him. Melina then arrives, aiming her crossbow at him but Bond talks her out of killing the defenseless man. While Bond talks to her, Kristatos draws a knife planning to kill Bond but Columbo lunges his own knife into Kristatos' back, killing him.
To be added
Despite his status as a seemingly heroic war hero and a distinguished, refined and cultured billionaire, Aris Kristatos is in fact an unscrupulous businessman who uses his respectable facade to play off his various enemies against each other in order to ensure that his superiors in the KGB and the Soviet Union have a smooth operation. A resourceful man, his cover allows him to be well received all over the Mediterranean Sea, making his true nature as a devious and manipulative agent even harder to imagine. Kristatos is also elegant and generally has a calm and thoughtful demeanour. However, despite his amoral methods and the nefarious nature of his activities, he seems to be genuinely attached to Bibi even though the girl sometimes feels oppressed by his tutelage and can sometimes rebel against her godfather, as was the case in St. Cyril, and Kristatos vows in return not to let his feet be trodden on. But he is still a ruthless double agent who cares above all about his reputation and the rewards he earns by serving the Soviet Union behind Britain's back.

587,/wiki/Count_Ugo_Carnifex,"Ugo Carnifex, also known as Count Ugo Carnifex, was a Sardinian warlord, businessman and head of the clandestine organisation, the Millenaria. The character served as the primary antagonist of Charlie Higson's 2006 Young Bond novel, Blood Fever.
Ugo Carnifex was one of three children born to a poor family in the Supramonte mountains of Barbagia, Sardinia. Initially subsisting as a goatherd, Carnifex and his younger brother, Guido, joined the Italian Army during the First World War and fought against the Austro-Hungarian Empire along Italy's north-east border. At the battle of Triangular Woods he suffered a head wound; the shock of which caused his hair to turn prematurely white. Cut off behind enemy lines, his four-man group took refuge in a deserted palazzo and hid in a septic tank. The experience would haunt Carnifex; inculcating a lifelong mysophobia (fear of uncleanliness). After emerging, a violent standoff ensued with Hungarian soldiers - concluding with the three remaining men (Ugo, Guido and a Hungarian named Zoltan) unexpectedly discovering the owners' hidden treasure. Guido, a religious man, objected to taking it. Ugo murdered him and made a pact with Zoltan to bury the trove and retrieve it after the war. However, the duplicitous Carnifex returned first and claimed it for himself.
With his newfound wealth, Ugo returned to Sardinia and adopted the title ""Count"". His sister, likewise benefitting from his status, fashioned herself as ""Contessa"" Jana Carnifex. Fancying himself a modern Caesar, Carnifex resurrected the Millenaria secret society and spent lavishly; constructing an extravagant palazzo complex around a tin mine (which Ugo would claim to be silver and credit for his ill-gotten fortune) in the Gennargentu massif. Despite its superficial grandeur, the fantasy Roman complex - with its vast dam, town, colosseum and aqueduct - was a shoddily constructed vanity project designed to showcase his ambitions and maintain the veneer of wealth. As his fortune dwindled Carnifex turned to selling stolen art via his uneven partnership with pirate Zoltan the Magyar and an Eton College professor, Peter Haight.
Bond succeeded in sowing the seeds of division - tricking Carnifex into believing the disgruntled Zoltan had enlisted the boy's help. James would eventually escape with the aid of a vengeful Barbati girl, Vendetta, whose brother Mauro had been murdered by Carnifex. Her village's subsequent attempt to strike back at the Count was quashed by soldiers led by his Scottish mercenary, Smiler. Bond was narrowly rescued by Zoltan and his pirates. Despite being outnumbered, they orchestrated an assault on Carnifex's palazzo as James secretly rescued Amy Goodenough from her cell. The vengeful and dying Zoltan blew up the poorly-constructed dam - sending a tsunami of water and sludge pouring down the mountains. Ugo Carnifex was crushed under his beloved Sikorsky seaplane and the entire complex was entombed under a thick layer of mud.

It was penned by future Bond author and 'James Bond 007: A View to a Kill writer Raymond Benson, who contributed towards the plot/design, but left the project before its completion.  
The game begins in Switzerland, where James Bond and Tilly Masterson are in the spy's Aston Martin DB5, pursued by Auric Goldfinger's henchmen in several Mercedes cars. Bond ditches his pursuers using the vehicle's defensive weaponry and sneaks into Goldfinger's plant. There he discovers that Goldfinger smuggles gold by melting it down and incorporating it into the bodywork of his car, which he takes with him whenever he travels. Bond also observes Goldfinger talking to a Chinese agent who is demonstrating what is later revealed to be an atomic bomb. 007 climbs across the rooftops and slips into the villain's office, pocketing helicopter blueprints initialed by Goldfinger's pilot, Pussy Galore and an ingot badge dropped by his Korean manservant, Oddjob. Fiddling with Goldfinger's golf set, Bond discovers a hidden room with a safe containing details of a meeting for ""Operation Bluegrass"". Leaving, Bond makes for the airport and travels to Goldfinger's stud farm near Kentucky.
Bond gains admittance using the badge and password from Switzerland and snoops around the stud farm; discovering an advanced helicopter in what was formerly a large breeding barn. He examines the aircraft, which is described as having two moulded seats filling up most of its cockpit, a large cargo area stretching behind them, and a great tinted glass dome which arcs overhead and on all sides. Pussy Galore rushes out at 007 from a dark corner of the barn, demanding to know what he is doing snooping around. The two brawl before Bond gains the upper hand, pinning her to the ground and seducing her. She reveals that Goldfinger financed her helicopter design (christened 'Grand Slam') under the pretense of helping her sell it to the Pentagon. As a maiden voyage, she was to make a flight to Fort Knox, landing on the roof, and taking off again before the guards could react; impressing the generals. In reality, Goldfinger plans to detonate an atomic bomb on-board - destroying the U.S. gold reserve along with Galore.
Bond witnesses Goldfinger's meeting with his co-conspirators. Although they are each promised $1 million, Goldfinger tempts them that they could have the million today, or $50 million tomorrow, and relates his plan to destroy Fort Knox; increasing the value of his own gold. When they presumably refuse, he then kills them. Using her access clearance, Galore helps Bond burst into the control room. As Goldfinger flees through an escape hatch above (closely followed by Galore), 007 is confronted by Oddjob. The manservant throws his deadly bowler hat at Bond, which narrowly misses and lodges into a control panel. As Oddjob attempts to retrieve the hat to finish him off, 007 flips a switch which turns the panel on - fatally electrocuting the henchman. Bond emerges from the escape hatch at the barn and climbs on-board the helicopter as it lifts off. Goldfinger examines the nuclear bomb, while keeping a gun aimed at the back of Galore's head. Bond disarms him and, as Goldfinger tries to lunge for the spy, he is propelled by his own lethal charge through the cargo door and out into the open air - falling to his death. After disarming the bomb, Bond and Galore fly to Fort Knox, where they fulfill the nobler aim of the scheme by eluding all defenses and leaving the defused bomb as a calling card of the speed and dexterity of the helicopter.
As a text-adventure, the player uses text input to control the game, and the game state is relayed to the player via text output. Input is provided by the player in the form of simple command sentences such as ""take ball"", ""look at plaque carefully"" or ""go east"", which are interpreted by a text parser. Despite its lack of graphics, the game includes a physical dimension where players move between rooms and locations; for example going north from area A takes you to area B etc. Players complete their objectives (such as investigating a room or solving a puzzle) within provided time limits - usually a set number of 'moves' or text entries. If they take too long the player character can be killed or imprisoned by approaching enemies; ending the game. The game includes a save game feature with nine save spaces.

589,/wiki/Giulietta_da_Vinci_(Maria_Grazia_Cucinotta),"Giulietta da Vinci (listed in the film credits as Cigar Girl) was a fictional assassin under the employ of the terrorist, Renard. She appeared in the 1999 James Bond film, The World Is Not Enough, and its accompanying novelization penned by Raymond Benson. The character was portrayed by Italian actress, Maria Grazia Cucinotta, and was doubled by stuntwoman Sarah Donohue.
Bond overpowers Lachaise's bodyguards and holds him at gunpoint. Just as Bond is about to get the name of an assassin, Lachaise is killed by a thrown knife in his neck by an escaping Giulietta. Bond and the Cigar Girl both escape from the building.

In a deleted scene of the film, we find that Giulietta is actually working for Renard, and she reveals that Bond on the case. Renard gives her the task of taking him out, and says that he trusts she won't let him down. She was also told to allow Bond to escape the original attack in Spain, so that the bomb would be delivered to MI6 headquarters. Bond returns to MI6 headquarters in London, England in order to return the money to Sir Robert King. However, the money was actually a fertilizer bomb which kills King and blows a hole in the wall of the building. Through a hole in the wall, 007 spots Giulietta, who is watching the building from a Sunseeker boat on the River Thames. The assassin is wearing a red leather body suit with a zipper down the front. She uses a machine gun to fire at Bond and then takes off down the Thames, with Bond pursuing in a prototype Q-boat.
An elaborate chase takes place along the Thames, and it ends at the Millennium Dome. Giulietta uses a grenade launcher as well. Just as two torpedoes are about to blow up her boat, she beaches her boat near the Millennium Dome, and jumps onto a hot air balloon basket. Bond follows closely by, and jumps to catch the mooring ropes to the balloon. Bond offers her protection from her real boss, but she refuses, asserting that Bond cannot protect her from ""him"". Giulietta then commits suicide by shooting the aircraft's gas tank, causing the balloon to explode in a huge fireball. Bond releases from the rope and falls onto the roof of the Millennium Dome, hurting his shoulder on the landing. This injury hampers him throughout the rest of the film. We later learn in the film that she was working for Renard or his full name, Victor Zokas. Giulietta was hired to keep an eye on Mr. Lachaise.
In the novel adaptation of The World Is Not Enough, then-current Bond novelist Raymond Benson gave the Cigar Girl a name: Giulietta da Vinci, and retained a scene between her and Renard in Bilbao that was cut from the theatrical release.

590,/wiki/Herr_von_Hammerstein,"Herr von Hammerstein, or just Hammerstein, was a fictional ex-Gestapo officer. The character was first introduced in Ian Fleming's 1960 James Bond short story, For Your Eyes Only, which was published in the eponymous anthology.
von Hammerstein was a short robust man of Prussian stock and an ex Gestapo officer, who immediately following World War II, fled Hitler's Germany and set up in Cuba. There he became the chief of the counter-intelligence bureau for the Batista regime. Shortly before the communist rebels of Fidel Castro took power, Batista sacked von Hammerstein who took his hoarded wealth and went abroad to invest it in property.
Seeking to purchase the estate of Colonel Timothy Havelock (Ret.) in Jamaica, he sent his hitman, Major Hector Gonzales, to negotiate the sale. When the offer was refused, Gozales kills the Havelocks and von Hammerstein proceeds to bully their daughter Judy Havelock into selling the property with intimidation tactics. Judy sets out on a vendetta to personally kill von Hammerstein and avenge her parents.
von Hammerstein moves to Echo Lake, his retreat in a remote area of Vermont to see out the winter with his Cuban henchmen and several whorish women. Judy tracked him there, as did James Bond who had been sent to eliminate von Hammerstein by M, a family friend of the Havelocks. Armed with a mere bow and arrow, Judy shoots von Hammerstein by in the back with a arrow from one hundred yards away at the precise moment von Hammerstein dived into a lake.

591,/wiki/Diamonds_Are_Forever_(novel),"Diamonds are Forever, published in 1956, is the fourth James Bond novel written by Ian Fleming. It was adapted into the seventh film in the James Bond film franchise starring Sean Connery as James Bond.
The novel takes place just over two months from the end of Moonraker, which ended with James Bond taking a small vacation. When Diamonds Are Forever begins, M instructs Bond to infiltrate a smuggling ring, which is running diamonds from African mines to the United States. Bond's job is to travel down the ""pipeline"" as far as he can and find out who is behind it all. Under the name of Peter Franks, a petty crook already known as a diamond smuggler, he meets a mysterious ""go-between"" named Tiffany Case with whom he falls in love. Bond discovers that the smuggling ring is being operated by a ruthless American gang called ""The Spangled Mob"", which is run by the brothers Jack Spang and Seraffimo Spang. Also part of the Spangled Mob are Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd -- two mysterious yet ruthless assassins.
As Bond learns throughout the novel, the pipeline begins in Africa where a dentist would pay miners to smuggle diamonds in their mouth which the dentist would extract during a routine appointment. From there, the dentist would take the diamonds and rendezvous with a German pilot who would transport the diamonds to London via helicopter. In London, Tiffany would get an assignment from a contact known only as ABC. She would then meet with ""the hire"" and explain to that person how to smuggle the diamonds to New York City. The ""hire"" is then instructed how to receive his payout, which is delivered via rigged gambling.
While undercover, Bond smuggles his diamonds into New York inside fake golf balls. He is given $1,000 and is instructed to bid on a horse named Shy Smile in Saratoga Springs to receive his full payoff. Bond learns from Felix Leiter (who has left the CIA due to injuries sustained in Live and Let Die and is working for Pinkerton's as a private detective) that the real Shy Smile is dead and that his identifying tattoo has been imprinted on another horse. They find that they are both investigating the same people and work together to turn the tables on the gig and get Shy Smile disqualified.
James Bond receives another $1,000 from the mob and is instructed to gamble four hands at The Tiara in Las Vegas -- a casino owned by Seraffimo Spang. After pressing his luck in The Tiara and turning his $5,000 payout into $20,000 in a game of roulette, Bond is driven off the road and is captured by the Mob and tortured, aboard Seraffimo's historic train in a recreated ghost town named ""Spectreville."" (Spectreville actually has no connection whatsoever to Bond's nemesis SPECTRE, which appears later in Thunderball.)
Bond manages to escape with the help of Tiffany Case, who has turned against the mob due to her strong feelings for Bond. (He had been trying to win her over with his charm since he met her.) They manage to escape the train and light it on fire, killing Seraffimo. They flee the mob to New York where they catch The Queen Mary to London. Unbeknownst, they are spotted and Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd board the same boat. Bond pieces together their presence on the boat but they had already captured Tiffany. Bond climbs down the side of the ship with a rope made from sheets and manages to overpower them, killing them both.
In Sierra Leone, Bond stakes out the known contact point for the mine dentist. Rufus Saye (the mysterious ""ABC"" contact Tiffany had in London) arrives. He has been closing the smuggling ring, eliminating everyone involved. Later, Bond goes to Africa to stop the beginning arm of the smuggling ring. The man tries to get away, but Bond stops him by shooting down his helicopter, effectively ending the smuggling ring.
Diamond smuggling was a topic of great interest to author Ian Fleming. In 1957, Fleming wrote a non-fiction book on the subject, titled The Diamond Smugglers, which was published in the same format as his Bond novels and, as a result, is often erroneously listed as a Bond book. Additionally, author Geoffrey Jenkins claims that he had collaborated with Fleming on the plot of a novel featuring James Bond and dealing with diamond smuggling, titled Per Fine Ounce. This book is claimed by numerous sources including The Bond Files by Andy Lane and Paul Simpson as being commissioned by Glidrose Productions. The book completed circa 1966 but was never published.

597,/wiki/Cubby_Broccoli,"Albert Romolo Broccoli (April 5, 1909 – June 27, 1996) known to millions of movie fans as ""Cubby"" Broccoli (a nickname used by a cousin), produced more than forty movies, but will be remembered by most for his contribution to one of the most successful film franchises in history, James Bond.
Broccoli was born into an Italian-American family on Long Island. The family moved to Florida, and on the death of his father Giovanni, Broccoli moved to live with his grandmother in Astoria, Queens in New York City.
In 1940, at the age of 31, Cubby married actress Gloria Blondell (younger sister of Joan Blondell); they later divorced in 1945 without having had children. Having worked many jobs, including casket maker, Broccoli became involved in the film industry. He started at the bottom working as a gofer on the 1941 film The Outlaw. Here he met Howard Hughes, who oversaw production of the movie when director Howard Hawks was fired.
Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in late 1941, Broccoli joined the United States Navy, returning to Hollywood in 1945 to work as an agent at the Famous Artists Agency.
At the beginning of the 1950s, Broccoli moved once more, this time to London. A shrewd businessman, he was able to make good use of the subsidy given by the British government to subsidise films made in the UK with British casts and crews. In 1951, Broccoli married Nedra Clark, who died after giving birth to their daughter, Tina.
In the 1960s, Broccoli met and married actress and novelist, Dana Wilson (née Dana Natol), who died of cancer in 2004 at the age of 82.
In 1962, Broccoli teamed with Harry Saltzman to create the production company, EON Productions and its parent company Danjaq, LLC. Broccoli produced the first Bond movie, Dr. No, that year, and his involvement in the series continued until his death. His family, particularly daughter Barbara Broccoli and stepson Michael G. Wilson, have since produced the James Bond films.
Besides the Bond movies, Broccoli produced the Dick Van Dyke classic Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, from the book by James Bond author Ian Fleming, and the Bob Hope vehicle Call Me Bwana, the only film made by EON Productions outside of the James Bond franchise.
In 1981, he was honored with The Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his work in film and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Broccoli died at his home in Beverly Hills in 1996 at the age of 87 of natural causes and was interred in Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles following a Catholic funeral mass, attended by some of the James Bond movies' cast members, such as Desmond Llewelyn, Maryam d'Abo and Timothy Dalton.

600,/wiki/Drax_Industries,"Drax Industries or Drax Enterprise Corporation is a company founded and owned by the billionaire industrialist Hugo Drax. Although primarily an aerospace company, the Drax Group also owns a number of subsidiaries worldwide, producing and transporting individual equipment components. It appears in the 1979 James Bond film, Moonraker, and was later re-imagined for the 2012 video game, 007 Legends.
Drax Industries first appears in the 1979 film Moonraker, in which the villain, Hugo Drax, uses the company to further his scheme of wiping out the majority of humanity and replacing it with a new master race of 'perfect' human specimens. As an aerospace firm, the company is known for manufacturing the Moonraker space shuttles for NASA.
Arriving in California, James Bond is given a brief aerial tour of the Drax Industries facilities by pilot Corinne Dufour. She shows him the main complex - a large-scale industrial area contained on the Drax Estate - where all the main production facilities for assembling the Moonraker shuttles (workshops, hangars, design and experimental blocks) are located. Aside from manufacturing the Moonraker shuttles the complex also houses research laboratories. Initially, the laboratories were secretly being used to develop a deadly nerve toxin. But by the time of the film's events production has been moved to another location - the Venini Glass factory in Venice.
Later in the film, Bond follows confidential weapons blueprints to Venini Glass, a Venetian glass manufacturer originally founded by Bruno Venini and subsequently acquired by Drax Industries. Ostensibly a legitimate business, the glass-works' founder is notable for having crafted a glass-handled sword, the only one of its kind in the world, which was owned by General Menotti in the late 18th century. Its glass museum houses numerous examples of Venini's craftsmanship. However, following Drax's acquisition of the firm, their premises have secretly become the location where his doomsday weapon is assembled, with its glass components and the Black Orchid toxin produced on site.
The completed devices are then shipped via import-export firm Carlos and Wilmsberg Inc. to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. As with Venini Glass, Carlos and Wilmsberg are also a subsidiary of the Drax Group. Manuela, an operative of Station VH, notes that they are very big importers in Rio and have have a warehouse on Carioca Avenue.
Bond investigates the warehouse only to find it empty. Drax has moved the weapons via his haulage company, Drax Air Freight, to a secret launch facility located somewhere in the upper basin of the Amazon River. Operating from São Pedro airport, Drax Air Freight runs a fleet of Lockheed L-188 Electra aircraft.
Hugo Drax's leadership places a strong emphasis on eugenics, as the billionaire uses Drax Industries to further his scheme of wiping out the bulk of humanity and replacing it with a new master race. Many of the company's employees physically reflect this principle.

601,/wiki/ASP_pistol,"The ASP pistol is a custom made 9mm handgun designed and built by Armament Systems and Procedures, Inc. The weapon functioned as James Bond's primary sidearm in John Gardner's 1981-96 continuation series; beginning with his 1984 novel, Role of Honour. It was also featured in Eclipse Comics' 1989 graphic novel, Permission to Die.
While presenting the weapon to Bond, Major Boothroyd reveals that the gun is essentially a modified Smith & Wesson M39, but the gun given to Bond was a further modified American version of the firearm, featuring a shortened barrel and grip and lightened slide lexan grips featuring clear panels to allow the user to see how much ammunition was left in the clip. All edges on the gun were rounded down, including the spur and hammer to prevent it from snagging on the user's clothes upon the draw. The exterior metal was coated with teflon, all of which lead to Bond thinking it felt like a bar of soap.
The Asp boasted a ""guttersnipe"", in which the sights on the gun were painted yellow to allow for a distinct view of the target. In addition to this, amounts of the radioactive element Tritium were embedded in the sights to allow for accurate targeting in low-light situations. Q Branch further modified Bond's Asp to be compatible with a silencer.
The Asp fires special ""Glaser Safety Slugs"", which are capsules containing #12 shots suspended in liquid teflon originally developed to prevent overpenetration and ricochets. These specifications allow the slugs to pierce automobile glass, and to provide ample stopping power. It is considered by Boothroyd to be equally powerful to the .44 Magnum.

She provides him with an aerial tour of Drax's property and flies him to his opulent Californian estate. After the meeting concludes, she escorts the spy to meet with Dr. Holly Goodhead. While staying at Drax's châteaux, Bond visits the seemingly innocent Corinne in her bedroom to elicit information. She hesitantly tells Bond what little she knows and they sleep together. During the night, Bond sneaks across the hall to investigate Drax's study. Corinne wakes and follows him there, telling him to get out of the office. She inadvertently reveals where the safe is located and stands by as Bond photographs the documents it contained.
Unfortunately for Corinne, she is unknowingly witnessed by Drax's henchman as she leaves the study. After Bond departs for Venice the following morning, Corinne is summoned by Drax while he is out hunting. He informs Corinne that her employment has been terminated due to her involvement in Bond's safe breaking the previous night. As Corinne walks away, Drax sets his trained hunting dogs onto her. She flees into the woods, where she is subsequently mauled to death. Bond apparently remains unaware of her demise.

604,/wiki/Felicity_Willing,"Felicity Willing was the fictional managing director of humanitarian charity, the IOAH (International Organisation Against Hunger). The character served as the primary antagonist of Jeffery Deaver's 2011 James Bond continuation novel, Carte Blanche.
Felicity Willing was raised in the Western Cape province of South Africa. The only child of English parents, her father was a mining company executive. The family moved back to London when she was thirteen. Her rural upbringing in the bush led to ostracization at boarding school. From there she was educated at the London Business School and was subsequently employed at a major City investment bank. It was there that she began a lasting partnership (and brief, albeit manipulative, romantic interlude) with Northern Irish engineer and former Sapper, Niall Dunne. Their shared amorality led to establishing ties with warlords and dictators in sub-Saharan Africa. Meanwhile, Willing became managing director of the National Organisation Against Hunger (NOAH) in South Africa. Ostensibly a non-governmental organisation seeking to combat western ""superfarms"" on the African continent, NOAH was actually a front organisation which she used to manipulate African nations with the promise of food aid. Eventually, the NOAH became an international charity and was rebranded ""IOAH"".

614,/wiki/Dolly_(Blanche_Ravalec),"Dolly is the fictional love interest of steel-toothed assassin Jaws. The character appeared in EON Productions' 1979 film Moonraker and was portrayed by French actress Blanche Ravalec.
In Rio de Janeiro, during an attempt to assassinate James Bond by running a cable car into him, Jaws and his associate accidentally crash the car into the terminal building. He is rescued from the rubble by a short, blonde girl and the pair instantly fall in love. The couple later accompany wealthy megalomaniac Hugo Drax and his ""master race"" astronauts, to an orbiting space station. After 007 is taken prisoner, he is lectured (in Dolly and Jaws' presence) on Drax's plan to annihilate and replace the human race with a new master race sired by his handpicked ubermenschen. Bond tricks Drax into revealing his intent to kill anyone who fails to meet his standards of physical perfection – causing the hulking, dentally-disfigured Jaws and his petite, nearsighted girlfriend concern. She provides Jaws with quiet encouragement to switch his allegiance and help 007.
Aided by Bond's sabotage, U.S. space marine astronauts board the station to stop Drax's scheme and destabilize its structural-integrity during the resulting laser rifle firefight. As Bond and his allies flee the disintegrating station, Dolly and Jaws reunite in the control room and share a final bottle of Bollinger Champagne together. Shortly afterward, Dolly and Jaws help Bond and Holly Goodhead escape in Moonraker 5 by releasing a jammed docking mechanism. The section which they were on subsequently broke away from the exploding station and drifted. The space marines' commanding officer, Colonel Scott, later reported to mission control that he had picked up two survivors from the doomed station - ""a tall man and a short blonde woman"".

The silent bodyguard was one of several unidentified Quantum operatives who accompanied Greene to a meeting during a performance of Tosca at an opera house in Bregenz, Austria. Alongside the environmentalist's right-hand man, Elvis, he stands guard over his boss in his personal box. As James Bond compromises the meeting, the driver maintains his stoic appearances, gathering up Greene's cabal of guards and ushering them to his vehicle. As the group prepares to leave, 007 throws Guy Haines' bodyguard on Greene's car. The villain orders the driver to kill the injured man and the driver shot the bodyguard in the chest, killing him and letting Bond be framed for the murder.
Some time later the driver is seen at the Perla de las Dunas in Bolivia's Atacama Desert, where he watches over Greene's meeting with exiled dictator, General Medrano, and the corrupt Bolivian police chief in regards to their payment for Quantum's continued control of Bolivia's water supply. The calm of the meeting is however shattered by the arrival of Bond, who kills the police chief. During the ensuing shooting, Greene and Elvis attempts to evacuate to the hotel's upper floors while the driver stay behind in order to kill Bond but he scarcely proves a deterrent to the determined agent, who shoots the henchman in the stomach repeatedly with a SIG-Sauer P226, killing him. The driver's corpse is later incinerated when the hotel is destroyed.
The driver's calm nature indicated a fierce loyalty to his employer, something further demonstrated by his complete willingness to sacrifice his life to protect Greene. Despite this apparent bond to Greene, he is also shown as a borderline sociopath due to his murder of Guy Haines' bodyguard without flinching or question.

617,/wiki/Grenade_bracelets,"Grenade bracelets were a fictional clandestine explosive weapon disguised as a pair of wrist bracelets. Utilized by the freelance assassin Selah Sax, the equipment was presumably created and supplied by her former employer, the British government black ops unit, Group 13. Sax used both bracelets during her rescue of 007 from a Yakuza casino in Tokyo, Japan. The weapons appeared briefly in Dynamite Entertainment's James Bond comic arc, Black Box, which ran between 1st March and 2nd August 2017.

618,/wiki/Explosive_pen,"Issued by Q during James Bond's equipment briefing in London, the explosive pen is a class IV grenade disguised as a stainless steel Parker Jotter pen. Three clicks of the cap arms its four-second fuse, another three disarms it. While attempting to sabotage the Janus Satellite Control Center, 007 is captured and his equipment confiscated. The pen is inadvertently triggered by villainous programmer, Boris Grishenko, who begins nervously clicking it, assuming it to be an ordinary pen. Bond knocks the pen from his hand just before it detonates; damaging the control center and providing a distraction for his escape.
Returning to war-torn Kurdistan, James Bond finds the body of 008 outside the cave he rescued him from during his first mission to the region. He searches the body and pockets one of Q's explosive pens. 007 subsequently uses it to clear rocks which block a path to the Warzone.
The explosive pen sees usage in the PlayStation variant of The World Is Not Enough (2000) as 007 chases the traitorous Bullion through Istanbul. Disguised as a generic pen, the device is magnetic and can destroy doors or barriers. Like its GoldenEye cousin, the weapon is primed by clicking three times to activate its three-second fuse.

619,/wiki/Albert_R._Broccoli_007_Stage,"Albert R. Broccoli's 007 Stage (formerly James bond (007) Stage) is one of the largest sound stages in the world, and certainly the most famous. It is located at Pinewood Studios, Iver, Buckinghahire, United Kingdo, and named after the famous James Bond film producer Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli.
The stage was originally conceived in 1976 by production designer Ken Adam to house the set he had designed for the interior of the Liparus supertanker in the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. The stage was christened the ""007 Stage"" on December 5, 1976 during a ceremony attended by the then-current British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson. In contrast to the volcano crater set Adam had built for You Only Live Twice in 1966, the 007 Stage would be a permanent structure that could be rented out to other productions.

620,/wiki/Carlos_(Quantum_of_Solace),"Bolivian police chiefColonel Carlos was the fictional corrupt chief of Bolivian police and ally to General Medrano and Dominic Greene. A major antagonist, the character appeared in the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace and was portrayed by Spanish actor Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Colonel Carlos starts off as the contact of French agent René Mathis when James Bond goes over to La Paz, Bolivia, to investigate Dominic Greene's intent of securing a portion of Bolivian land for Quantum. He also meets Bond and MI6 agent Strawberry Fields during the Greene Planet Fundraiser Party, right before Bond escapes while Fields is killed by Greene's henchmen.
Eventually, Carlos reveals his true colors by murdering Mathis and implanting his body inside Bond's car in order to frame Bond for the murder and have him arrested by the police. However, Bond escapes again after killing two of Carlos' policemen, much to Carlos' anger.
Eventually, Carlos meets with exiled Bolivian general Luiz Medrano in Perla de las Dunas, a hotel in the Bolivia's Atacama Desert, as it turns out that Carlos is in cahoots in helping Medrano overthrow the Bolivian government as part of Greene's plan. Carlos receives his share of the money (through euros) from Elvis for his efforts, but before he leaves in his car, Bond jumps on the departing vehicle and shouts ""You and I had a mutual friend!"" before shooting him and his driver in the heads in revenge for Mathis' death. Carlos and the driver's bodies are destroyed when the car explodes after reversing into a fuel tank.

621,/wiki/Azerbaijan,"Azerbaijan is a nation located in the Caucasus region of Central Asia, and a former republic of the Soviet Union. It is a major setting in The World is Not Enough.
An oil-rich nation, it is the ancestral home of the family of Elektra King, the presumptive heir to King Industries owned by her British-born father Sir Robert King. Elektra resided in a lavish villa in the capital city of Baku. Former KGB agent and Russian mafia boss Valentin Zukovsky apparently owned a casino in Baku.
Following Sir Robert's assassination in London, James Bond travels to Baku to provide protection for Elektra King, who is in the process of re-routing her father's oil pipeline when the local population riots against the project. Bond rescues Elektra when mercenary forces attack the unfinished pipeline. Believing the anarchist and Elektra's former kidnapper Renard to be responsible, Bond approaches Valentin Zukovsky for information on Renard's whereabouts at his casino.

623,/wiki/Bald_Man_(Hollis/Rietty),"Initially a partially unseen character portrayed by Anthony Dawson and Eric Pohlmann (Voice), Blofeld was subsequently played on screen by Donald Pleasence, Telly Savalas and Charles Gray. A final depiction of the character (unnamed for copyright reasons) appeared in the pre-title sequence of For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by John Hollis and voiced by Robert Rietty. Following years of litigation over the ownership of the character, Blofeld was later re-invented for the Daniel Craig continuity of James Bond films (2006-2021), portrayed by Christoph Waltz.
Arriving at an isolated part of the base, Blofeld activates the base's self destruct system before fleeing. Although Blofeld escaped, Bond managed to destroy the rocket remotely before it could capture more astronauts.
Now the subject of an international man-hunt by the British Secret Service titled Operation Bedlam, Blofeld establishes a clinical allergy-research institute atop Piz Gloria in the Swiss Alps. James Bond investigates the office of Swiss lawyer Gumbold, and learns that Blofeld is corresponding with London College of Arms' genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, attempting to claim the aristocratic title ""Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp"". He ventures to Switzerland posing as Bray to gather intelligence on Blofeld, who has went to the lengths of having his earlobes surgically removed to back-up his claims of nobility. There he learns that Blofeld secretly plans to contaminate and ultimately sterilize the world's food supply using biological warfare, carried by his brainwashed Angels of Death. Blofeld claimed he would not carry out his plan if all his past crimes were pardoned and he is recognised as the current Count de Bleauchamp. Bond tries to trick Blofeld into leaving Switzerland so that MI6 can arrest him without violating Swiss sovereignty. Blofeld refuses and Bond is eventually caught by henchwoman Irma Bunt. Blofeld reveals that he identified Bond after his attempt to lure him out of Switzerland, and tells his men to take the agent away. Bond eventually makes his escape by skiing down Piz Gloria while Blofeld and his men give chase.
Aided by his future wife, Tracy, the next morning their flight resumes. However, they are intercepted by Blofeld, who sets off an avalanche; resulting in Tracy's capture, while Bond is buried but manages to escape. M tells 007 that Blofeld's ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. Bond then enlists Marc-Ange Draco and his Unione Corse forces to attack Piz Gloria, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a bobsleigh, with Bond pursuing him. The chase ends when Blofeld becomes snared in a tree branch, ripping him out of the bobsled and apparently killing him. Subsequently, Bond and Tracy marry in Portugal and pull over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car. As they converse, Blofeld (wearing a neck brace) and Bunt commit a drive-by shooting of the couple's car - with Blofeld driving, and Bunt firing the gun. Bond survives, but Tracy is killed in the attack.
Following the pipeline trail, 007 breaks into Willard Whyte's penthouse apartment only to be unexpectedly confronted with two identical Blofelds (who uses an electronic device to sound like Whyte). Bond kills one of the Blofelds, but he turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, where he is picked up by Blofeld's assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd and taken out to Las Vegas Valley where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. Bond escapes and calls Blofeld posing as his right-hand man, Bert Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and rescues him, but in the meantime Blofeld retreats to his oil platform off the coast of Baja California. In the process of escaping he abducts Bond's smuggler ally, Tiffany Case. With the satellite now in orbit, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, then proposes an international auction. Bond travels to the oil platform and is captured in an attempt to sabotage the weapon. Shortly afterwards Felix Leiter and the CIA begin a helicopter attack on the rig. In the ensuing chaos Blofeld attempts to escape using a midget submarine, but Bond gains control of the submarine's launch crane and crashes the sub into the control room, causing both the satellite control and the base to be destroyed.
Blofeld evidently survived the attack and resurfaced years later (dialogue in Marvel's comic adaptation would suggest 10 years after their last encounter) with a plan to exact revenge on his old adversary, James Bond, for foiling his plans and causing the downfall of his criminal organisation. Now wheelchair-bound, bald and wearing a neck-brace, Blofeld rigs a ""Universal Exports""-emblazoned Bell 206 helicopter with remote control hardware and remotely electrocutes the pilot after he collects 007. Taking control of the aircraft over a London gasworks, Blofeld toys with Bond before attempting to crash the flying death-trap in a warehouse. However, 007 regains control of the aircraft and impales Blofeld's wheelchair on its landing gear, lifting the villain into the skies. After toying with his nemesis, Bond drops the pleading Blofeld down a tall industrial chimney stack, killing him from the impact, avenging Tracy's death.
Ernst Stavro Blofeld's personality, in its authoritarian and inhuman megalomania, fits perfectly in the line of such infamous historical names as Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler or Stalin. Despite his absolutely ruthless character, he possessed an exceptionally calm and calculating mind, always acting in a thoughtful manner and leaving nothing to chance.
Although Blofeld was more of a strategist and a master thinker in the background, he was not afraid to personally intervene in the battle if necessary. However, he was most courageous when surrounded by a sufficiently large armed bodyguard, otherwise he cultivated a rather defensive fighting style, whose main goal was his safe escape. He also was a self-concerned megalomaniac who only cared about results, profit, power, and world domination, no matter how many henchmen he needs to sacrifice or innocent lives need to be lost in the process.
Even with several other Bond villains with massive attempted body counts, Blofeld’s plots were easily among the worst and most destructive in the franchise, having threatened millions of innocent lives and planned widespread, irreparable destruction, all stemming from megalomania and other purely selfish reasons without the faintest notion of good intentions.
Although not present in the novel, Blofeld makes his first on-screen appearance in From Russia with Love, portrayed by Anthony Dawson and voiced by Eric Pohlmann. Both men remained uncredited, the end credits listed a question mark instead of an actor’s name. In this appearance his face is not seen and only his lower body is visible as he strokes his trademark white cat, discussing a plan to avenge the death of their member Doctor Julius No by setting a trap that will put Bond and Russian agent Tatiana Romanova in a position where it will appear that they killed each other while escaping to escalate tensions in the Cold War. After being absent from Goldfinger, Blofeld returned in Thunderball.
Right before Blofeld is killed, he begs to Bond to spare him, and cryptically bribes him with a delicatessen in stainless steel. This line had been added in by the producer of the film, Albert R. Broccoli, as a throwback to Mafia slang for a very cushy bribe used during the time and place he was growing up in (as at the time, having a delicatessen in stainless steel was considered luxurious especially if the owner was a street vendor).
The classic depiction of Blofeld has appeared in a number of James Bond video games as a playable multiplayer character. His first appearance was in the 2004 first-person shooter video game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, developed by EA LA and published by Electronic Arts. During its development official footage of character renders released by the publisher featured the terrorist leader 'Number One' holding his Persian Cat, with the likeness of Donald Pleasence. Likely due to legalities, in the final product the character's face is obscured, shot from behind and from the neck downwards. Number 1 was voiced by actor Gideon Emery using a similar intonation to Pleasence's portrayal of the character.

634,/wiki/Frost,"Miranda Frost was a fictional intelligence operative working for the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6); however, her true allegiance lies with infamous diamond magniate Gustav Graves. A secondary antagonist and Bond girl portrayed by British actress, Rosamund Pike, the character first appeared in the 2002 James Bond film Die Another Day, and was also featured in the film's accompanying novelization, penned by Raymond Benson.
Miranda is a Harvard-educated, gold medal-winning Olympic fencer (trained by Verity) posing as Graves' publicist and fencing partner. She won gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics by default, after Graves organized the real gold medalist's death by drug overdose. This earned Graves Miranda's allegiance.
While James Bond is sent to kill North Korean Colonel Tan-Sun Moon, Miranda secretly sends Bond's true identity to Moon's right-hand man, Zao. This leads to Bond's imprisonment at a North Korean torture camp, where he is brutally interrogated for 14 months before being exchanged for a captive Zao.
Miranda is sent by M to work alongside Bond, but does not approve of Bond's methods. When caught by Mr. Kil and his minions, Miranda helps Bond keep incognito by kissing him. They later spend the night together in Miranda's suite to keep up the pretense that they are lovers.
When Bond awakens and goes after Graves, Miranda pleads for him not to go, but he insists. Later when Bond faces Graves at gunpoint, Frost arrives as well, also aiming her gun at Graves. However, Graves asks Bond whether he already found out who betrayed him in North Korea, prompting Miranda to aim her gun at Bond, revealing that she was the one who betrayed Bond. 007 attempts to kill her, but realizes that his weapon is empty. While in bed together, Miranda had taken the opportunity to empty his Walther P99.
With Miranda's pistol trained on him and escape looking unlikely, Bond uses the sonic agitator ring - provided by Q - to shatter the glass platform on which they were both standing. Miranda and Bond fall into the jungle environment of Graves' geodesic dome (a structure alongside Graves' Ice Palace) after attempting to murder Bond with Graves' satellite weapon, Icarus, the villains leave aboard an Antonov An-124 aircraft.
Eventually Bond and his American NSA counterpart, Jinx Johnson catch up with Graves and Miranda in North Korea. Boarding Grave's Antonov, the pair split up; but Jinx is caught by Miranda at the controls of the aircraft. Miranda and Jinx have a climactic sword fight aboard the descending plane.
Miranda narrowly slices Jinx across the stomach, mocking Jinx by informing her that she can read her foe's every move, but Jinx manages to impale a dagger that was stuck on a copy of ""The Art of War"" into Miranda's chest. As Miranda looked down in shock, Jinx retorted ""read this, bitch"", punctuating it with a kick that forced the knife in deeper and Miranda fell backwards; stone dead.
Bond was later shown to have mourned Miranda; clearly showing, that despite her treachery, that he did love her.
Miranda Frost was a dangerous, experienced and dark woman who was willing to do anything to help Moon in his plans, even if it meant using her charms to seduce her enemies and lure them into traps. Her beauty was such that men could easily fall for her, allowing her to manipulate them easily while giving her a distinct advantage in hiding her true nature and making her appear to be an intelligent and innocent MI6 agent.
Like Miranda's boss, she was also a conscientious and thoughtful person who executed her actions with care whether as Moon's ally or as an MI6 agent. Thus, she was even able to easily deceive the M very experienced but also Bond and all her colleagues in the British secret service.
In the field, Miranda was also unimpressed by her opponents and her great skill in fencing combined with her MI6 training and her mastery of firearms allowed her to gain the upper hand but also made her excessively arrogant to the point of underestimating her antagonist, a weakness that ultimately led to her downfall at the hands of Jinx.

After World War II, he began to plot the return of the Nazi party and ensuing world domination with the National Socialist Action Army. He serves as the main antagonist in the 1983 James Bond novel Icebreaker by John Gardner.
Aarne Tudeer was born in Finland anywhere between the early 1910s and 1930s, and in adulthood became a high-ranking officer in the Finnish Army under Marshall Carl Mannerheim. In 1943, when the Finnish Army sided with the German army against the Russians during World War II, Tudeer accepted a position within the Schutzstaffel. By the end of 1943, Tudeer had been promoted to SS-Oberfuhrer and relocated to Nazi Germany. After the end of the war, Tudeer and a number of other Nazi officers and soldiers relocated to Argentina and then to a compound in Paraguay. However he quickly grew frustrated with the lack of drive in his contemporaries, and began gathering followers for his new National Socialist Action Army, a terrorist organization that would be quickly dismissed before followers infiltrated governments and re-emerged as a political party to vindicate Adolf Hitler's vision and create a worldwide European ""Master Race."" He procured funds from aging Nazis and used the name of ""Von Glöda,"" a defunct noble family distantly related to the Tudeers to re-emerge in the late 1960s. In the late 1970s, Von Glöda swindled soldiers at the Soviet arms depot Blue Hare into arming his followers, and was allowed to use an abandoned military bunker as a base of operations if he could provide the government with their old enemy James Bond.
In the early 1980s, at a military complex outside of Tripoli, Libya, all but six members of a Soviet-Libyan delegation were killed by assassination squads belonging to the neo-fascist NSAA using Russian weaponry. This event was later known as the Tripoli Incident. A month later, five members of the British Communist Party along with Russian members on a goodwill mission to London were killed by them as well. Within a year, no fewer than thirty assassinations ordered by the NSAA were reported worldwide.
Having arrived from his exercise near the Arctic Circle, M assigns James Bond on a covert operation codenamed Operation Icebreaker where he is aligned with Brad Tirpitz of the CIA, Koyla Mosolov of the KGB, and Rivke Ingber of the Mossad. Together, they are to investigate the theft and future destination of arms stolen by the NSAA headed by Count Konrad von Glöda from Russian bases. Beforehand, a background check conduct by Bill Tanner reveals Glöda's real name is Aarne Tudeer who served as a high-ranking officer in the Finnish Army under Marshall Carl Mannerheim. In 1943, when the Finnish Army sided with the German army against the Russians during World War II, Tudeer accepted a position within the Schutzstaffel. By the end of 1943, Tudeer had been promoted to SS-Oberfuhrer and relocated to Nazi Germany. After the end of World War II, Tudeer disappeared with indications of still being alive and still wanted for war crimes. In the 1950s, he was confirmed to have been spotted in South America, and returned to Europe during the 1960s having undergone a successful identity transplant.
When a photograph sent by M reveals that Rivke Ingber is actually Anni Tudeer (an associate of Paula Vacker), Bond learns from Ingber that her father married a widowed half-Lapp woman before leaving to Paraguay following the collapse of the Third Reich. In Paraguay, her father’s unstable behavior causes her mother and her to flee to Stockholm, Sweden using Swedish pasports and then to Helsinki using Finnish passports where she divorced Tudeer, and reclaimed her land.
Following their escape, Koyla tells Vacker and Bond that the Soviet Union had launched airstrikes against the Ice Palace, in which the two race back to witness. However, Glöda survives, and re-encounters Bond at the Vantaa airport where he attempts to escape Finland. Both Bond and Glöda exchange gunfire with the latter dying in the process.

646,/wiki/For_Your_Eyes_Only_(Marvel),"It was the second film in the series to have a comic book tie-in, following a Dr. No comic in 1962. Marvel Comics would go on to publish an Octopussy comic book adaptation in 1983.
While visiting the grave of his wife Tracy, James Bond is called away from his mourning by an MI6 helicopter sent to collect him. However, in mid-flight, the aircraft is revealed to be under the control of an old adversary. 007 gains control of the helicopter, lifts the villain into the skies and throw him down an industrial chimney stack. Meanwhile, the British information gathering vessel St. Georges, containing the Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC), is sunk after accidentally trawling an old naval mine in the Ionian Sea. The Soviets, learn of the fate of the St Georges and notify their contact in Greece. A marine archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock, who had been asked by the British to secretly locate the St Georges, is murdered with his wife by a Cuban hitman, Hector Gonzales.
Bond is ordered by MI6 Chief, M, to retrieve the ATAC before the Soviets, as the transmitter could order attacks by the Royal Navy's fleet of Polaris submarines. He goes to Spain to find out who hired Gonzales, and while spying on the hitman's villa, is captured by his men, but manages to escape as Gonzales is killed by a crossbow bolt. Outside, he finds the assassin was Melina Havelock, the daughter of Sir Timothy, and the two escape. Returning to London, Q Branch uses computerised technology to identify the man Bond saw paying off Gonzales as Emile Leopold Locque, and then goes to Locque's possible location in Cortina, Italy. There Bond meets his contact, Luigi Ferrara, and a well-connected Greek businessman and intelligence informant, Aris Kristatos, who tells Bond that Locque is employed by Milos Columbo, known as ""the Dove"" in the Greek underworld, Kristatos' former resistance partner during the Second World War. After Bond goes with Kristatos' protégée, figure skater Bibi Dahl, to a biathlon course, a group of men, which includes East German biathlete Erich Kriegler, chases Bond, trying to kill him. Bond escapes and then goes with Ferrara to bid Bibi farewell in an ice rink, where he is attacked by assassins in ice hockey gear.
007 fends off the attempt on his life and discovers Ferrara is dead in his car, with a dove pin in his hand. Bond then travels to Corfu in pursuit of Columbo. There, at a casino, Bond meets Kristatos and asks how to meet Columbo. After Columbo and his mistress, Countess Lisl von Schlaf, argue, Bond offers to escort her home. The two then spend the night together. In the morning Lisl and Bond are ambushed on the beach by Locque and Lisl is killed. Bond is captured by Columbo's men before Locque can kill him; Columbo then tells Bond that Locque was actually hired by Kristatos, who is working for the KGB to retrieve the ATAC. Bond accompanies Columbo and his crew on a raid on one of Kristatos' opium-processing warehouses in Albania, where Bond uncovers crates of Russian-built rocket launchers. After the facility is destroyed, Bond chases Locque and kills him.
Afterwards, Bond meets Melina, and they recover the ATAC from the wreckage of the St Georges, but Kristatos is waiting for them when they surface and he takes the ATAC. After the two escape an assassination attempt, they discover Kristatos' rendezvous point when Melina's parrot repeats the phrase ""ATAC to St Cyril's"". With the help of Columbo and his men, Bond and Melina break into St Cyril's, an abandoned mountaintop monastery. As Columbo confronts Kristatos, Bond kills the biathlete Kriegler. Bond retrieves the ATAC system and stops Melina from killing Kristatos after he surrenders. Kristatos tries to kill Bond with a hidden flick knife, but is killed by a knife thrown by Columbo. The Russians arrive by helicopter to collect the ATAC, but Bond destroys it by throwing it off the cliff. Bond and Melina later spend a romantic evening aboard her father's yacht when he receives a call from the Prime Minister.

648,/wiki/Blofeld_(classic_film_continuity),"Initially a partially unseen character portrayed by Anthony Dawson and Eric Pohlmann (Voice), Blofeld was subsequently played on screen by Donald Pleasence, Telly Savalas and Charles Gray. A final depiction of the character (unnamed for copyright reasons) appeared in the pre-title sequence of For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by John Hollis and voiced by Robert Rietty. Following years of litigation over the ownership of the character, Blofeld was later re-invented for the Daniel Craig continuity of James Bond films (2006-2021), portrayed by Christoph Waltz.
Arriving at an isolated part of the base, Blofeld activates the base's self destruct system before fleeing. Although Blofeld escaped, Bond managed to destroy the rocket remotely before it could capture more astronauts.
Now the subject of an international man-hunt by the British Secret Service titled Operation Bedlam, Blofeld establishes a clinical allergy-research institute atop Piz Gloria in the Swiss Alps. James Bond investigates the office of Swiss lawyer Gumbold, and learns that Blofeld is corresponding with London College of Arms' genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, attempting to claim the aristocratic title ""Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp"". He ventures to Switzerland posing as Bray to gather intelligence on Blofeld, who has went to the lengths of having his earlobes surgically removed to back-up his claims of nobility. There he learns that Blofeld secretly plans to contaminate and ultimately sterilize the world's food supply using biological warfare, carried by his brainwashed Angels of Death. Blofeld claimed he would not carry out his plan if all his past crimes were pardoned and he is recognised as the current Count de Bleauchamp. Bond tries to trick Blofeld into leaving Switzerland so that MI6 can arrest him without violating Swiss sovereignty. Blofeld refuses and Bond is eventually caught by henchwoman Irma Bunt. Blofeld reveals that he identified Bond after his attempt to lure him out of Switzerland, and tells his men to take the agent away. Bond eventually makes his escape by skiing down Piz Gloria while Blofeld and his men give chase.
Aided by his future wife, Tracy, the next morning their flight resumes. However, they are intercepted by Blofeld, who sets off an avalanche; resulting in Tracy's capture, while Bond is buried but manages to escape. M tells 007 that Blofeld's ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. Bond then enlists Marc-Ange Draco and his Unione Corse forces to attack Piz Gloria, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a bobsleigh, with Bond pursuing him. The chase ends when Blofeld becomes snared in a tree branch, ripping him out of the bobsled and apparently killing him. Subsequently, Bond and Tracy marry in Portugal and pull over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car. As they converse, Blofeld (wearing a neck brace) and Bunt commit a drive-by shooting of the couple's car - with Blofeld driving, and Bunt firing the gun. Bond survives, but Tracy is killed in the attack.
Following the pipeline trail, 007 breaks into Willard Whyte's penthouse apartment only to be unexpectedly confronted with two identical Blofelds (who uses an electronic device to sound like Whyte). Bond kills one of the Blofelds, but he turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, where he is picked up by Blofeld's assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd and taken out to Las Vegas Valley where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. Bond escapes and calls Blofeld posing as his right-hand man, Bert Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and rescues him, but in the meantime Blofeld retreats to his oil platform off the coast of Baja California. In the process of escaping he abducts Bond's smuggler ally, Tiffany Case. With the satellite now in orbit, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, then proposes an international auction. Bond travels to the oil platform and is captured in an attempt to sabotage the weapon. Shortly afterwards Felix Leiter and the CIA begin a helicopter attack on the rig. In the ensuing chaos Blofeld attempts to escape using a midget submarine, but Bond gains control of the submarine's launch crane and crashes the sub into the control room, causing both the satellite control and the base to be destroyed.
Blofeld evidently survived the attack and resurfaced years later (dialogue in Marvel's comic adaptation would suggest 10 years after their last encounter) with a plan to exact revenge on his old adversary, James Bond, for foiling his plans and causing the downfall of his criminal organisation. Now wheelchair-bound, bald and wearing a neck-brace, Blofeld rigs a ""Universal Exports""-emblazoned Bell 206 helicopter with remote control hardware and remotely electrocutes the pilot after he collects 007. Taking control of the aircraft over a London gasworks, Blofeld toys with Bond before attempting to crash the flying death-trap in a warehouse. However, 007 regains control of the aircraft and impales Blofeld's wheelchair on its landing gear, lifting the villain into the skies. After toying with his nemesis, Bond drops the pleading Blofeld down a tall industrial chimney stack, killing him from the impact, avenging Tracy's death.
Ernst Stavro Blofeld's personality, in its authoritarian and inhuman megalomania, fits perfectly in the line of such infamous historical names as Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler or Stalin. Despite his absolutely ruthless character, he possessed an exceptionally calm and calculating mind, always acting in a thoughtful manner and leaving nothing to chance.
Although Blofeld was more of a strategist and a master thinker in the background, he was not afraid to personally intervene in the battle if necessary. However, he was most courageous when surrounded by a sufficiently large armed bodyguard, otherwise he cultivated a rather defensive fighting style, whose main goal was his safe escape. He also was a self-concerned megalomaniac who only cared about results, profit, power, and world domination, no matter how many henchmen he needs to sacrifice or innocent lives need to be lost in the process.
Even with several other Bond villains with massive attempted body counts, Blofeld’s plots were easily among the worst and most destructive in the franchise, having threatened millions of innocent lives and planned widespread, irreparable destruction, all stemming from megalomania and other purely selfish reasons without the faintest notion of good intentions.
Although not present in the novel, Blofeld makes his first on-screen appearance in From Russia with Love, portrayed by Anthony Dawson and voiced by Eric Pohlmann. Both men remained uncredited, the end credits listed a question mark instead of an actor’s name. In this appearance his face is not seen and only his lower body is visible as he strokes his trademark white cat, discussing a plan to avenge the death of their member Doctor Julius No by setting a trap that will put Bond and Russian agent Tatiana Romanova in a position where it will appear that they killed each other while escaping to escalate tensions in the Cold War. After being absent from Goldfinger, Blofeld returned in Thunderball.
Right before Blofeld is killed, he begs to Bond to spare him, and cryptically bribes him with a delicatessen in stainless steel. This line had been added in by the producer of the film, Albert R. Broccoli, as a throwback to Mafia slang for a very cushy bribe used during the time and place he was growing up in (as at the time, having a delicatessen in stainless steel was considered luxurious especially if the owner was a street vendor).
The classic depiction of Blofeld has appeared in a number of James Bond video games as a playable multiplayer character. His first appearance was in the 2004 first-person shooter video game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, developed by EA LA and published by Electronic Arts. During its development official footage of character renders released by the publisher featured the terrorist leader 'Number One' holding his Persian Cat, with the likeness of Donald Pleasence. Likely due to legalities, in the final product the character's face is obscured, shot from behind and from the neck downwards. Number 1 was voiced by actor Gideon Emery using a similar intonation to Pleasence's portrayal of the character.

650,/wiki/Green_Four_(Bill_Weston),"The character is first introduced during James Bond's arrival at Blayden House. As Koskov's debriefing concludes, 'Green Four' enters the kitchen to discover a Soviet Assassin, Necros, dumping the cook's body into a chest freezer. Reaching for his radio, he utters ""Green Four to base-"", then he brings out his gun which is kicked from his hand. The butler engages Necros in hand-to-hand combat with the upper hand, blocking a shot from a rolling pin and thwarting the assassin's use of an electric carving knife by yanking out the knife's plug. Holding him over the oven, Necros forces the butler's face onto the hot grill before having a fist-full of flour thrown into his eyes. Viciously brawling around the room, Necros makes a second attempt with a knife, green four kicks him back and burns Necros’s hand on the active grill, before Necros reaches for a saucepan of boiling water. Green Four narrowly avoids the scalding water before the assassin inflicts a series of strong kicks, eventually resulting in him being knocked out by a blow from a frying pan.

653,/wiki/Aston_Martin_V8_Vantage_Volante,"The Aston Martin V8 Vantage Series II was hailed at its 1977 introduction as ""Britain's First Supercar"" for its 170 mph (270 km/h) top speed. Its engine was shared with the Lagonda, but it used high-performance camshafts, increased compression ratio, larger inlet valves and bigger carburettors mounted on new manifolds for increased output. Straight-line performance was the best of the day, with acceleration from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 5.3 seconds, one-tenth of a second quicker than the Ferrari Daytona. Notably, it was featured in the 1987 film The Living Daylights and the Craig era in the 2020 film No Time To Die. 
The first series had 375 hp (280 kW), and series specific details such as a blanked bonnet vent and a separate rear spoiler. 38 of these were built (plus 13 ""Cosmetics"" for the US). The Oscar India (for October 1, the date of introduction) version, introduced in late 1978, featured an integrated tea-tray spoiler and smoother bonnet bulge. Inside, a black leather-covered dash replaced the previous walnut. The wooden dashboard did find its way back into the Vantage during the eighties, giving a more luxurious appearance. The Oscar India version also received a slight increase in power, to 390 hp (291 kW). This line was produced, with some running changes, until 1989. From 1986 the engine had 405 hp (302 kW).
The Vantage name had previously been used on a number of high-performance versions of Aston Martin cars, but this was a separate model. Although based on the Aston Martin V8, numerous detail changes added up to a unique driving experience. One of the most noticeable features was the closed-off hood bulge rather than the open scoop found on the normal V8. The grille area was also closed off, with twin driving lights inserted and a spoiler added to the bootlid.
The 1986–1989 580X was a performance package, with bigger carburetors and Nimrod racing-type heads, the same 437 hp (326 kW) V8 as fitted to the limited-edition V8 Zagato. 16-inch (406-mm) wheels were also now fitted. If this wasn't enough, a 450 hp (336 kW) 6.3 litre version was also available from Aston Martin, and independents offered a 7 litre version.
304 Series 2 coupés were built, and 192 Volantes (in spite of only having been officially introduced in 1986, near the end of production). Of the Cosmetic Vantage (for the US), 14 Series 2 coupés and 56 Volantes were built. Cosmetic Vantages were built for the United States market – they lacked the powerful Vantage engine but retained the Vantage name, and the look was changed with a flattened hood. From 1980 they featured DOT-approved 5 mph (8 km/h) safety bumpers front and rear. Most of these cars have since been retrofitted with full power, European spec engines.
Alongside the Vantage saloon, ‘Britain’s first supercar’ could be had as a steroid-enhanced convertible. It came with the same luxuries as the ‘ordinary’ Volante, but also trumpeted the 5.3-litre Vantage-spec engine. The USA was desperate for a new high-performance drophead coupé – Aston hadn’t built one since 1970 – so this breeze machine was keenly received there. That’s where the vast majority ended up, making them a rare sight in Europe and their homeland...although James Bond managed to get hold of one for 1987’s The Living Daylights.
The film reunites Bond with British car maker Aston Martin. Following Bond's use of the Aston Martin DBS in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the filmmakers turned to the Lotus Esprit in 1977s The Spy Who Loved Me, which reappeared four years later in For Your Eyes Only. Despite the iconic status of the submersible Lotus however, 007's Aston Martin DB5 was recognised as the most famous of his vehicles. As a consequence, Aston Martin returned with their V8 Vantage. According to special effects supervisor, John Richardson, the decision to use Aston Martin occurred late into production, resulting in problems obtaining vehicles. With an 18 month waiting list for Aston Martin's V8 Vantage Volante, the production team sourced and bought three used Vantages for filming. While one was being outfitted with gadgets, another stunt vehicle began filming the chase scene in Austria.
For The Living Daylights a total of 11 cars were used, though only three of which were real drivable vehicles. One was an unmodified Vantage used for filming scenes with Timothy Dalton, the second was a stunt car and the third was dubbed a ""special effects car"", complete with missiles and rocket booster. Aside from one other vehicle which was little more than a steerable chassis without an engine, the rest were fiberglass mock-ups produced at Pinewood. At the beginning of the film, the car is first introduced as a V8 Volante (convertible). The car used in these scenes was a Volante owned by Aston Martin Lagonda chairman, Victor Gauntlett. To allow for the transition from the Volante to the hardtop saloons used later in the movie, Q-Branch is shown to have fitted Bond's Volante with a hardtop (it has been ""winterised""). Effectively transforming the Volante into a saloon car for the benefit of the audience.
The V8 Vantage Series II returns in the No Time To Die film where the producers brought back Dalton’s car, including the DB5, along with two new Aston Martins like the Valhalla and the DBS Superleggera.
As with previous Q-Branch vehicles, all the Vantage's ""optional extras"" were armed and operated by switches concealed in the center arm rest.

654,/wiki/Dr._Katya_Nadanova,"Dr. Katya Nadanova is a fictional nanotechnology scientist and co-conspirator with Nikolai Diavolo. A secondary antagonist in the 2004 James Bond video game Everything or Nothing, Nadanova is portrayed by German model Heidi Klum.
Nadanova, an Oxford-educated scientist has a large knowledge about nanotechnology, making her more than a little useful to her boyfriend, Diavolo. Nadanova is first mentioned in the pre-level briefing for ""A Long Way Down"", in which it is revealed that MI6 believes she has been kidnapped for her knowledge of nanotechnology. After the level, she is seen being forced onto a train, which Bond rescues her from. The two then commandeer a helicopter and use it to shoot down her kidnappers and return Katya to her home, where Nikolai Diavolo waited to see if her mission was successful. She replies that it was, and that all but one nanobot were destroyed. She then gives the nanobot to Diavolo.
She is later seen in ""Vertigo"", pushing Serena St. Germaine out of a helicopter. Bond later spots her and Diavolo leaving New Orleans. It is then revealed that Katya developed the Nanobots to repair nuclear reactors, but Diavolo had used the last of her original Nanobots to create a new one that would destroy any metal it came across, except for platinum: the material they are made of. Later, in Puerto Viejo, Peru, Katya finds Bond trespassing in a Platinum mine, and she tranquillise him and brings him to Diavolo, and when he is finished with him, Katya sets a mining drill to burrow through him.
Oblivious to his escape, she, Diavolo, and Jaws launch their nanotech-fuelled invasion of Moscow. Once again, she discovers 007 - this time on-board a freight elevator feeding a nuclear missile silo underneath the Kremlin. Departing, she orders her men to (unsuccessfully) kill him. Katya and Diavolo then begin the launch sequence for eight Soviet ballistic missiles equipped with nanotech payloads. Bond deactivates the ICBMs, and the two attempt to flee the facility in a Russian hoverjet. As they fly through the elevator shaft, 007 downs the aircraft and its leaking nanobot payload eats through the elevator floor on which the wreckage precariously balances. Katya subsequently plummets to her death, while Diavolo ejects in time.

655,/wiki/Franz_Oberhauser,"Ernst Stavro Blofeld, born Franz Oberhauser, was the main antagonist of the the rebooted James Bond series, serving as the unseen overarching antagonist of the first three films Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall, the main antagonist of Spectre and the overarching antagonist of No Time to Die.
He was not surprised when 007 and White's daughter, Madeleine Swann, determined the location of his base of operations. Greeted with a formal reception, Blofeld took them on a tour of his data-collection facility. He attempted to psychologically intimidate the pair, demonstrating his organisation's vast reach, and sadistically taunted Bond with intimate knowledge his past failures. This included showing Swannn footage of Bond and her father, moments before Mr. White had shot himself, which Bond had furiously demanded that Blofeld turn off. Enraged and determined to prevent Swann from seeing her father's death, Bond charged at Blofeld, only to be knocked to the ground by one of Blofeld's henchmen. Concluding, Blofeld had Bond struck unconscious and strapped him to a neurosurgical chair.
Revealing his new identity, the mastermind declared his intention to intimately torture Bond by drilling into his skull, the seat of his soul; depriving him of the ability to recognize faces, and, ultimately, destroying his visual cortex, leaving him completely blind. He was saved by Swann, who hurled the spy's explosive wristwatch at Blofeld's control console, which violently detonated and threws him across the room. In the chaos, Bond escaped and shots a fuel line - causing the entire complex to be consumed in an enormous fireball. Somehow, Blofeld survived the conflagration, but was left severely scarred on the right side of his face and, ironically, blind in his right eye.
Bond returned to London to prevent ""Nine Eyes"", with Blofeld following him to exact his revenge. He separately abducted Swann and Bond, and took them both to the ruins of the old SIS Building, which was scheduled for demolition. 007 freed himself and confronted Blofeld inside. Separated by a pane of bullet-proof glass, the villain revealed that he had hidden Madeleine somewhere inside the building. It was set to explode in 3 minutes: giving Bond the sadistic choice of dying alongside her, or saving himself and living with the pain. 007 liberated Swann and they narrowly escaped the building.
Believing them to be dead, Blofeld departed by helicopter - unaware that they were pursuing him along the River Thames in a boat. One of Bond's gunshots started an engine fire; causing the aircraft to crash land on Westminster Bridge. The wounded Blofeld crawled from the wreckage and was confronted by 007. Held at gunpoint, he told the spy to kill him. But Bond refused, ejecting his magazine, clearing the chamber, and stating that he was out of bullets. As Bond departed with Madeleine, SIS chief, Gareth Mallory, detained the villain on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, under the Special Measures Act of 2001. With Denbigh dead and the ""Nine Eyes"" scheme foiled, Blofeld accepted his fate with resignation.
Now the sole remaining member of the organisation, Blofeld came under the scrutiny of SIS, who confiscated his prosthetic eye and permitted Bond to perform an interrogation. Meanwhile, Safin blackmailed Swann into smuggling Heracles into Belmarsh with the intent of infecting Blofeld with the lethal virus-like weapon. Unwilling to do the deed, she inadvertently infected Bond; who, after being goaded by Blofeld, strangled him in a fit of rage. He was consequently infected with Heracles and perished within seconds.
Blofeld was also intensely sadistic, describing himself to James Bond as ""the author of all [his] pain."" Throughout their confrontations, he would ruthlessly play a number of cruel and elaborate games with James' mind about his past and the people he had lost all his life - Vesper, M, his parents, etc., torturing Bond by drilling holes in his head and penetrating his brain, remaining calm and smiling when James screamed in pain, and condemning Mr. White to a very painful death by thallium poisoning. Blofeld had little self-preservation instinct, despite his vile character.

656,/wiki/GoldenEye_(video_game),"The topic of this page has a wiki of its own:  GoldenEye Wiki.
GoldenEye 007 is a 1997 first-person shooter video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The game is based on the 1995 film GoldenEye.
The game has received overwhelmingly positive reviews and often listed as one of the best games for the Nintendo 64 and sold over eight million copies. It is considered an important title in the development of first person shooters, and has become particularly well-known for the quality of its multiplayer deathmatch mode, as well as its incorporation of stealth and varied objectives into its single-player missions.
GoldenEye 007 was originally announced for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System before being stepped up to the Nintendo 64. The intention for the first few months of development was for the game to be an on-rails shooter; it only became a first-person shooter later in development. The development team working on GoldenEye 007 was inexperienced; for all but two of them, the project was their first game.
The game is based upon the GoldenEye film and its novelization by John Gardner, but, as game designer Martin Hollis explained, many of the missions were extended or modified to allow the player to participate in sequences of which Bond was not originally a part, or those in which he only played a minor role. The original sets that were created for the film were first converted into complete, believable environments by one group of game designers; when this process was complete, other designers began populating them with objectives, characters and obstacles in order to create a balanced and fun game. According to Martin Hollis, ""many of the levels in the game have a realistic and non-linear feel. There are rooms with no direct relevance to the level. There are multiple routes across the level."" Hollis also noted that the concept of several varied objectives within each level was inspired by the multiple tasks in each stage of Super Mario 64.
GoldenEye was developed through two and a half years, but, according to Martin Hollis, only the last year was spent developing the game. During the beginning, the engine was built, art assets were made, and the enemy AI was written and polished. The game was delayed numerous times, partly because during development, the team decided to incorporate a multiplayer feature to the game to demonstrate the N64's 4-player capabilities. In addition to the N64 game, a version of GoldenEye was in development for the Nintendo Virtual Boy, but was canceled before release.
GoldenEye 007's menu system is presented as an MI6 dossier. Four save files are available to track the player's progress through the game's twenty missions, each of which may be played on either ""Agent,"" ""Secret Agent,"" or ""00-Agent,"" difficulty settings, with higher difficulties requiring the player to complete additional and more complex objectives. M, Q, and Miss Moneypenny provide background information on the chosen mission and its goals.
Once a mission is completed, the player may either continue progressing through the story or choose to replay a previously completed level. Completing certain missions within particular target times enables the player to unlock bonus cheat options which make various changes to the graphics and gameplay, and upon fully completing the game on the 00-Agent difficulty level, an additional ""007"" setting allows the player to customize the challenge of any mission.
The player's initial weapon in most missions is James Bond's Walther PPK. Most of the game's firearms are modeled on real-life counterparts, while others are based on fictitious devices featured in the Bond films, such as the Golden Gun and Moonraker laser. The weapons vary in characteristics such as rate of fire and type of ammunition used, and inflict different levels of damage depending on which body part they hit. Stealth is an important element of the game: in order to avoid gunfights with multiple opponents, it is advantageous to eliminate soldiers and security cameras before they spot or hear the player. Certain weapons may be powerful enough to shoot through doors and helmets but are very loud, while others incorporate suppressor or zoom lens attachments to aid the player in killing enemies discreetly.
Some gadgets from the James Bond film series are featured in the game and are often used to complete particular mission objectives; for example, 007's in-game watch includes the laser from the GoldenEye film, the remote mine detonator from GoldenEye and Moonraker, and the electromagnet from Live and Let Die.
The multiplayer mode was added late in the development process; Martin Hollis noted that the setting was ""a complete afterthought"". According to David Doak, the majority of the work on the multiplayer mode was done by Steve Ellis, who ""sat in a room with all the code written for a single-player game and turned GoldenEye into a multiplayer game.""
The multiplayer mode features all of the characters in the game, including enemies and civilians. At first, only 8 characters are available, with 25 more becoming available as progress is made through the game. A button code allows players to temporarily unlock another 31 characters, all but two of them likenesses of the programmers. Variations between characters' heights and builds can affect the challenge of shooting them; for example, there is a significant difference between defeating Oddjob, who is oddly short in stature, and Jaws, a giant.
As with the selectable characters, only a few arenas are available at first, with more becoming available as progress is made in the game. There are eleven arenas, not counting levels that can only be accessed with a GameShark, and a ""random"" button that chooses the level randomly. The multiplayer-only arenas are: Temple, Complex, Caves, Library, Basement, and Stack. Several arenas are taken from the single player mode, with alterations such as restrictions on which sections of the map can be used - they are the Facility, Bunker, Archives, Caverns, and Egyptian.
The multiplayer mode features five general scenarios, within which options such as weapon schemes may be altered. Weapon selections in the multiplayer mode are grouped by type, such as pistols, automatics, and explosives. Other selectable weapon schemes focus on weapons not frequently found in the single player mode, such as laser guns, throwing knives, or the one-hit kill Golden Gun. The ""Slappers Only!"" setting removes all projectiles, limiting players to hand-to-hand combat.
Several references to James Bond films exist in GoldenEye 007, the most apparent being the titles of the various multiplayer modes and the Bond Girl names for the game's control schemes. The CCTV tape found in the second Bunker mission features the cover of the VHS release of the GoldenEye film.
Several members of the game's development staff were featured in the game as generic character faces. Bond's double-agent contact ""Dr. Doak"" in the ""Facility"" mission is named after and bears the likeness of David Doak. The ""Klobb"" weapon (originally ""Spyder""), is named after former Nintendo employee Ken Lobb.
Like the movie, GoldenEye 007 starts in Arkhangelsk, USSR during the mid-1980s, where MI6 has uncovered a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond is sent to infiltrate the facility by bungee jumping from the dam, then join his friend and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan in destroying the factory. During the mission, Trevelyan is apparently killed by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond escapes by commandeering an airplane.
The following missions depict 007's investigation of the satellite control station in Severnaya, Russia where Natalya Simonova and Boris Grishenko work, a location he did not visit in the film. Entirely new to the game is the ""Silo"" mission in which Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in Kyrgyzstan, believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as GoldenEye. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated electromagnetic pulse at any Earth target to disable any electrical circuit within range; from its orbit, it would be a threat to any city on earth.
Bond's visit to Monte Carlo and investigation of the frigate La Fayette and the Eurocopter Tiger (referred to as the ""Pirate"" in the game) were featured in the film, but here they are expanded, with Bond rescuing several hostages inside the ship and planting a tracker bug on the helicopter before it is stolen by the Janus crime syndicate. Bond is then sent a second time to Severnaya, but during the mission he is captured and locked up in the bunker's cells along with Natalya Simonova–this meeting takes place much earlier than in the film. The two escape the complex seconds before it is destroyed, on the orders of Ourumov, by the GoldenEye satellite's EMP.
As in the film, Bond next travels to Saint Petersburg, where he arranges with ex-KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky to meet the chief of the Janus organisation. This is revealed to be Alec Trevelyan–his execution by Ourumov in the Arkhangelsk facility was faked. Bond and Natalya escape from Trevelyan, but are arrested by the Russian police and taken to the military archives for interrogation. The player must escape the interrogation room, rescue Natalya and communicate with Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin, who has verified Bond's claim of Ourumov's treachery.
Natalya is captured by General Ourumov, and Bond gives chase (he can use a tank like in the movie, though he has the option not to) through the streets of Saint Petersburg, eventually reaching an arms depot used by Janus — the player must destroy its weaponry stores, then hitch a ride on Trevelyan's Soviet missile train. This section features many departures from the film storyline, where Bond does not reach the depot, and only enters the train after stopping it with the tank. Bond makes his way through the train, killing Ouromov and rescuing Natalya. However, Alec Trevelyan and his ally Xenia Onatopp escape to their secret base in Cuba.
Natalya accompanies Bond to Cuba. Surveying the jungle aerially, their light aircraft is shot down. Unscathed, Bond and Natalya perform a ground search of the area's heavily guarded jungle terrain, but are ambushed by Xenia, who is quickly killed by Bond. Bond sneaks Natalya into the control center to disrupt transmissions to the GoldenEye satellite and force it to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. An original mission shows Bond following the fleeing Trevelyan through a series of flooded caverns, which conceal a Satellite Dish under water. He then arrives at the antenna of the control centre's radio telescope. Trevelyan attempts to re-align it in a final attempt to restore contact with the GoldenEye. Bond destroys machinery vital to controlling the dish and kills Trevelyan in a precarious firefight high above the dish.
Two further missions unrelated to the GoldenEye film were included as bonuses for the completion of the game on higher difficulties. The first, ""Aztec Complex"", is partially based on the James Bond film Moonraker, and is unlocked when the player completes all 18 missions on Secret Agent difficulty. During the mission, Bond is sent to the Aztec complex in Teotihuacán to investigate the Drax Corporation's unlicensed space exploration in which at least one space shuttle was stolen from NASA. Although Hugo Drax was killed by Bond in the movie, it has seemed that his corporation still existed after his death due to remnants and fragments that were still active. MI6 believes their intentions with the shuttle in space are militant in nature and authorizes Bond to reprogram the shuttle's guidance computer so that MI6 can take control of the craft once it reaches orbit. During the mission, Jaws makes a return in an effort to stop Bond from completing his mission. Many of the rooms in the mission were from the movie and included several new features, such as the launch room for the Moonraker shuttle.
The second bonus level, ""Egyptian Temple"", blends elements from the films The Man with the Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, and Live and Let Die. To access this level players must complete all 18 missions on 00 Agent difficulty. Prior to the mission, M informs Bond that a person claiming to be Baron Samedi is in possession of the deceased Francisco Scaramanga's legendary ""Golden Gun"" pistol. Samedi has invited James Bond to the El-Saghira temple in the Valley of the Kings to retrieve it. Knowing it is a trap, M sends Bond regardless to take possession of the Golden Gun and eliminate Baron Samedi. Although the player ""kills"" Samedi three times during the level, he can be seen laughing in an end-of-level cut scene, similar to the ending of Live and Let Die.
GameShark users found several text references to a level called ""Citadel"" in the game. Rare explained its nature, and joked about players' speculation that multiplayer-mode Bond characters could be seen in the single-player game: ""'Citadel' was a very rough test level designed during the early stages of multiplayer mode. It is not in the finished game in any shape or form, and Oddjob and Mayday would not be in it if it was."" It was thought that a few textual references were all that remained of the level. In 2004, GoldenEye 007 fan sites uncovered an unplayable but viewable single-player version of the level (with implemented sky and water textures).
In 2005, the website GoldenEye Forever revealed that it was possible to access a fully playable multiplayer version by linking a GameShark to a computer. The codes to access Citadel in its fullest state totaled nearly 10,000 lines. The test map is largely a mass of shapes and ramps that the players can climb upon, thus giving players many opportunities for sniping and for hiding.
Before GoldenEye 007 was released, Rare had placed a feature in the multiplayer mode of the game, known as the ""All Bonds"" option. This would allow players to choose four of the five actors (at the time of the game) who had portrayed Bond in various films: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan. George Lazenby was not included. However, before the game was released, Rare removed the feature for unexplained reasons. It is assumed that Rare had every intention to release the game with the feature, but was later forced to remove it. In response, Rare said ""Yes, it was the hope of the team that [all Bonds] would be available to play, but for various reasons they weren't.""
In addition, the actors' portraits were at one point used to illustrate the four single-player save file dossiers; this was also removed, with Pierce Brosnan's portrait appearing on all four in the final version.
Not all remnants of the All Bonds feature were completely removed from the GoldenEye software. One major clue was the fact that the portraits of the four Bonds in the selection screen for multiplayer mode were accessible by using a GameShark. Also, various screenshots in the game manual, such as one from the multiplayer selection screen, show traces of the former Bond portraits.
The feature was brought to the attention of many gamers when the gaming magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly published an April issue with what they called the ""All Bonds Cheat"", using some fake screenshots ""to support"" its claim. The magazine reported that to unlock the option in the cheat menu, a player must complete the Aztec mission on 007 difficulty in less than nine minutes with all customisable enemy settings on the highest difficulty. The claim was later found to be an April Fools prank, which the magazine held annually.
In 2005, a program called the GoldenEye ROM Editor was released by The Rare Witch Project. The coders SubDrag and Ice Mario cracked the compression format of the images used by the game, allowing any image in the game's memory to be viewed and edited, by opening up a ROM image of the game. It was then discovered that the All Bonds faces and suits are still in the game; Rare had only removed the ability to use them. By mapping them onto other multiplayer characters' faces and bodies, one can try to recreate All Bonds, although since the body and head shapes do not match the textures, it will not look as it was intended.
When GoldenEye 007 was released in 1997, its stealth elements and varied objectives contrasted with the approaches taken by Doom and Quake, and its split-screen deathmatch mode proved popular. These factors contributed to the game's commercial success, selling eight million copies.
In 1998, GoldenEye received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment ""Games Award"" and Rare won the award for ""Best UK Developer"". It also won four awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences: ""Console Action Game of the Year"", ""Console Game of the Year"", ""Interactive Title of the Year"" and ""Outstanding Achievement in Software Engineering"". Additionally, it was nominated for ""Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics"" and ""Outstanding Achievement in Interactive Design"".
In a January 2000 poll, readers of the long-running British video game magazine Computer and Video Games voted GoldenEye 007 into first place in a list of ""the hundred greatest video games"". In a poll in the next year, the game was ranked 5th. Also in 2001, Game Informer magazine ranked GoldenEye 007 16th in a list of the ""Top 100 Games of All Time"". In 2005, a ""Best Games of All-Time"" poll at GameFAQs placed GoldenEye 007 at 7th. In a list made by IGN in 2005, GoldenEye was ranked 29th while the Reader's Choice placed it at 7th.
The game originally received a ""nine out of ten"" score in Edge, with the magazine later stating that ""a ten was considered, but eventually rejected"". In the magazine's 10th anniversary issue in 2003, the game was included as one of their top ten shooters, along with a note that it was ""the only other game"" that should have received the prestigious ""ten out of ten"" rating.
Video game review site ScrewAttack rated GoldenEye number one on three different Top 10 lists, winning the title of ""Best FPS"", ""Best Movie Game"" and ""Best Local Multiplayer Game"".
On Game Rankings, GoldenEye 007 has been ranked number 5 on the voting average list with an average vote of 9.2.
The game continues to be played by fans, many of whom have developed online communities. There are those who enjoy replaying single-player levels in an attempt to achieve fast times, those who battle others in its deathmatch mode, while others use GameSharks and similar devices to examine and to modify the game's code. On October 25, 2006, a fansite, The Rare Witch Project, released a level editor that allows users to place objects and write AI routines for existing stages on a ROM image, so new stages can be developed.
The James Bond game license was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1999, which published new games based upon the then-recent James Bond films Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough. The latter game, along with others published by EA such as Agent Under Fire and Nightfire are similar in style to GoldenEye 007.
In the autumn of 2004, Electronic Arts released GoldenEye: Rogue Agent for Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and later the Nintendo DS. This is the first game based on the 007 franchise in which the player does not take on the role of James Bond himself; rather they control an aspiring 00-agent (named GoldenEye) who is recruited by Auric Goldfinger. The game has little to do with either the film GoldenEye or the N64 game. It was released to mediocre reviews, and was criticized for using the ""GoldenEye"" name in an attempt to exploit the success of Rare's game
In the aftermath of E3 2006 Activision obtained the rights for James Bond games from MGM and EON, and their first game Quantum of Solace was released on October 31, 2008 which was developed by Treyarch.
Reggie Fils-Aime, the President of Nintendo of America, announced that Nintendo is exploring the possibility of adding GoldenEye 007 to the Wii Virtual Console, despite a complicated situation in which the game's developer Rare is owned by Microsoft and the video game rights to the James Bond franchise are held by Activision. He stated, ""We would love to see it [on the Virtual Console], so we're exploring all the rights issues.""
On January 11, 2008, 1UP reported that a GoldenEye port had been in development at Rare for several months, but stated that the title would not be released on the Xbox Live Arcade since ""Microsoft and Nintendo couldn't agree on the financial side of things.""

657,/wiki/Ed%C3%A1ine_Gayla,"Edáine Gayla was a Bond Girl and hidden antagonist in the 1989 James Bond comic Permission to Die by eclipse comics and acme press.
After falling in love with her idealistic professor, Dr. Erik Widziadlo, she agreed to remain behind the iron curtain in 1968, gathering information on the Soviet Union until her extraction.
In 1989, arrangements for the lovers reunion began. English Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond was sent to extract Gayla, posing as Widziadlo's niece, from military custody in Hungary. She was loaded into a military convoy one morning only to be rescued amidst a firefight by James Bond. She quickly joined him in a small helicopter that was pursued by a larger military chopper. Bond maneuvered them through several tunnels to get it hit by an oncoming military train, which succeeded while rupturing their helicopter's fuel line. Forced to continue on foot, they dodged Soviet soldiers all the way to a ruined castle, where Bond found her some foul-tasting bird eggs to eat as she told him her alleged backstory of how she had dreamed of freedom but had been unable to join her uncle and been kept under close surveillance because of Widziadlo's advocation for social reform. Allegedly expecting Bond to be acting on his own, she feigned surprise at his revelation that Widziadlo had offered the British government technology in return for her rescue. She then rested in a pile of hay in the castle while Bond went to scout ahead and returned in the morning with two stolen horses for them. As they neared the fence at the border, Bond's horse was shot and Gayla had him get up onto her own before Bond blew up the fence, taking out the soldiers stationed there in the process. In Austria there was a welcoming committee waiting to greet them, and the two kissed in the back of a Jeep on the way into the city.

661,/wiki/Aston_Martin_V12_Vanquish,"Nightfire:Everything or NothingThe V12 Vanquish rose to fame after being featured as the official James Bond car in Die Another Day, the twentieth James Bond film. In the film, the Vanquish has the usual Bond film embellishments, including adaptive camouflage which rendered the vehicle virtually invisible. It subsequently appeared in the 2002 video game Nightfire (can be driven in the console version only), as well as 2004's Everything or Nothing.
The V12 Vanquish was available as either a 2+2 or 2 seat coupe. The distinctive radiator grille and lower air intake are flanked by driving lamps and turn indicators. Both the front wings and hood panels incorporate a series of finely detailed compound curves which sweep back to intersect dramatically with the main cabin form. The rear fenders also flare out from the bodyside, extending back to a wide rear deck that supports the upper cabin, reminiscent of the DB5. The main body structure of the V12 Vanquish including the floor and the front and rear bulkheads are formed from extruded aluminum sections bonded and riveted around the central transmission tunnel which is constructed entirely from carbon fiber. Single piece composite inner body side sections with carbon fibre windscreen pillars are also bonded to the central structure to create a high strength safety cell. The Vanquish is powered by a 5.9 L (5935 cc) 48-valve 60° V12 engine, which produces 343 kW (460 hp) and 542 N·m (400 ft·lbf) of torque. It is controlled by a fly-by-wire throttle and a 6-speed 'paddle shift' or semi-automatic transmission and will accelerate to 60 mph in under 4.5 seconds and 100 mph in under 10 seconds.
The Vanquish has drawn criticism for a number of weaknesses in its design. In particular, some interior materials have been cited as unfit for a car of this price and prestige. Much of the aluminum trim is actually plastic and several of the instruments are visibly related to items from less exotic Ford Motor Company products. Additional concerns of owners and testers included the weight and apparent cooling system deficiencies of the car. Weighing well over two tons with driver and fuel, the car's sporting aspirations were drawn into question by its excess weight and a cooling system that reportedly failed to support sustained track activity in warm weather.
In the film Die Another Day, after having his license to kill reinstated by M, Bond is equipped with his new car - the Aston Martin V12 Vanquish (playfully nicknamed the ""Vanish"" due to its ""adaptive camouflage"" feature). The car was equipped with all the usual Bond refinements including its most notorious feature: a cloaking device, which allowed it to become practically invisible at the push of a button. The car would go on to be heavily featured in the movie, especially during the Iceland segments, where the car is involved in an elaborate chase sequence with a Jaguar XKR driven by the villain's henchman Zao.
Whilst the standard car came with rear wheel drive and a massive 5.9-litre V12, the Vanquish used for filming was equipped with four-wheel drive and a Ford-sourced 300bhp V8 in order to increase traction on the ice.
Following the release of Die Another Day, the V12 Vanquish would appear in the 2002 video-game Nightfire. The game was released in two very different versions for the PC and console platforms; with driving elements not present in the PC variant. In the console version of Nightfire, players got a chance to race through the streets of Paris, through Austrian villages and plunge into the depths of the South Pacific. Influenced heavily by Electronic Arts' previous 007 games, Agent Under Fire, the vehicle was equipped with a range of new features including a rocket booster, EMP pulse, smokescreen generator and a sub-aquatic mode reminiscent of the Lotus Esprit S1 from the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me.
Also in the 2004 video-game Everything or Nothing, 007 would use the V12 Vanquish. In this game, the players would drive it in the streets of New Orleans, equipped with missiles, machine guns, an electromagnet, and an acid slick.
According to the switches in the car's control console the Vanquish is also equipped with a mortar, lasers, grenades and targets. None of which are actually used in the film.

662,/wiki/000,"The 00 Section of MI6 is considered the secret service's elite. A 00 (typically read ""Double O"" and denoted in Fleming's novels by the letters ""OO"" rather than the digits ""00"") is a field agent that holds a licence to kill in the field, at their discretion, to complete any mission. Standard mandatory retirement age is 45 though various writers including Ian Fleming, Sebastian Faulks and John Gardner have contradicted this as a matter of Poetic License and several actors who have portrayed Bond on film have been older than 45 at the time of playing the character. Although Fleming only mentioned five 00 agents, others have been added over the years across various franchise media.
The following list is of the known members of this elite order who have been referenced in officially licenced James Bond fiction: novels, films, video games, and comic strips (not including impostors).

663,/wiki/Fredrick_Gray_(Geoffrey_Keen),"Sir Frederick Gray is the fictional British Minister of Defence, an official within Her Majesty's Government and head of the Ministry of Defence. Played by English actor Geoffrey Keen, Gray was a recurring character who first appeared in the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, and went on to appear in Moonraker (1979), For Your Eyes Only (1981), Octopussy (1983), A View to a Kill (1985), and The Living Daylights (1987).
Sir Fredrick Gray is the Minister of Defence for the British government. He appears alongside Bond's boss M or in his own office. In The Spy Who Loved Me he is introduced during a briefing over the submarine crisis. Bond obviously knows Gray well since he later calls him 'Freddie' during a private discussion between them. In all subsequent meetings, Bond addresses Gray as 'Minister' since other officials are present.
At the end of The Spy Who Loved Me, Gray, along with General Gogol, M and Q, witness Bond and Anya Amasova under the sheets in an escape pod. This embarrassment might explain the apparent souring of his relationship with Bond, who thereafter is treated formally and/or disdainfully.
In Moonraker, Gray is seen walking into a secret laboratory with M and Bond, all wearing gasmasks, but it is revealed embarrassingly to be nothing more than an ornamented office with Hugo Drax waiting inside to chide them. Gray – who after this angrily tells M, ""Your man should be taken off the case!"" – is again present at the end of the film to witness Bond under the sheets, this time in space with Holly Goodhead.
In For Your Eyes Only, Gray is seen alongside the Chief of Staff Bill Tanner (M is on leave) trying to find out what happened to the spy ship St. Georges. Once again, at the end of the film Gray is embarrassed, this time by linking the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with Max the (rude) Parrot instead of 007, whom he accuses of having gone mad.
In Octopussy, Gray suggests that Bond go with Jim Fanning, the art expert to see the auction of a Fabergé egg, Property of A Lady. Gray is seen at the end of the film celebrating with Gogol and M.
In A View to a Kill, the Minister is seen talking with Bond and M about Max Zorin and microchips. At the end, Gray is once again seen celebrating (though they think Bond may be dead) with M and Gogol in the former's office, this time about 007 preventing Silicon Valley from being destroyed.
In the final film that Gray appears in, The Living Daylights, he is seen with M, Bond and General Koskov at the Blayden safe house – this is Koskov's debriefing following his supposed defection. Later, Gray proclaims, ""We're the laughing stock of the intelligence community!"" when Koskov is apparently kidnapped. Reference is made to his having to explain all this to the PM: ""She'll have our guts for garters!""

664,/wiki/Dominique_Paradis_(Lena_Reno),"Dominique Paradis was a fictional French Intelligence agent and ally to James Bond in the 2002 video-game 007: Nightfire. The main Bond girl of the game, the player encounters her early in the game as she attempts to track down a missing nuclear warhead. She is voiced by actress Lena Reno.
Dominique and Bond first meet during ""Paris Prelude"", the opening mission of 007: Nightfire (console edition). Bond is assigned to protect the operative as she attempts to prevent an act of terrorism in Paris on New Year's Eve. Moments from being overwhelmed by enemies, Bond rescues her and continues the pursuit in his Vanquish. After preventing the terrorists from destroying the Eiffel Tower, the pair celebrate the new year together over a glass of champagne.
Following the Paris incident, Dominique is assigned to track down a missing nuclear warhead. She discovers that the trail of evidence leads to supposed green industrialist Rafael Drake and goes undercover to find out more. Consequently, she seduces Drake and becomes his mistress. This allows Dominique attends a party hosted at his Austrian castle. Acting as Bond's contact, she meets him in the library and the pair share an intimate moment before being interrupted by CIA agent Zoe Nightshade.
Noting that Drake's associate Alexander Mayhew has arrived with a stolen missile guidance module, they conclude an exchange is immanent. Dominique suggests that the meeting will probably occur in the nearby conference room and quickly heads back to the party before Drake can suspect anything.
Their paths cross again at the Phoenix Building in Tokyo, as Bond infiltrates the villain's headquarters under the cover of darkness. As she arrives at the building by helicopter, she notices Bond scaling the building's exterior and intercepts him in the stairwell. Confirming that Bond has walked into a trap, she helps him escape; suggesting that he take the stairwell to the rooftop and parachute to safety. The pair embrace, unaware that they have been caught on a surveillance camera.
They meet for a final time after Bond is drugged and transported back to the Phoenix Building by Kiko Hayashi. Kiko and two thugs escort Bond to Drake, who is dining with Dominique on the rooftop helipad. After announcing that he is aware of Dominique's betrayal, Kiko is ordered to throw her over the side of the building. Dominique attempts to defend herself and provides a successful distraction for Bond's escape, showing an impressive talent in martial arts. However, Kiko easily defeats her and suddenly kicks Dominique squarely in the gut, knocking Dominique off the side of the helipad to her death, seventy floors below to the lobby floor. Bond survives and gets out of the building by being picked up by Alura McCall in a red getaway car, but was left distraught about Dominique's death, explaining that he ""lost a friend"".
In the level Countdown, Bond avenges Dominique by confronting Kiko at Drake's launching silo where she is killed by incineration from the spacecraft's engines.

665,/wiki/Dr._Mortner,"Dr. Carl Mortner, born Hans Glaub, was a fictional German geneticist who served Hitler and the Nazi regime during the Second World War. He later became the head scientist of wealthy businessman, Max Zorin. A major antagonist portrayed by British actor, Willoughby Gray, the character first appeared in the 1985 James Bond film, A View to a Kill, and was subsequently adapted for the 1983-87 tabletop role-playing game, James Bond 007: Role-Playing In Her Majesty's Secret Service.
Born Hans Glaub in 1913, at some point in his life he began a career in science, with an interest in breeding and genetics. His methods were akin to the infamous mad scientist Josef Mengele, who had little regard for human life, requesting the Nazis send some concentration camp subjects to him for purposes of experimentation, to be treated like lab rats. Hans Glaub's speciality was steroids and hormonal experimentation on pregnant women who were corraled into the concentration camps. Most of Glaub's experiments ended in failure, causing most of the experimented mothers to miscarry. However, a handful of women did successful deliver babies. These babies were often psycotic in nature, but grew into children with gifted intelligence. Glaub took an interest in such ""super kids"" one of whom was Max Zorin, whom he took special care.
Unlike many of his fellow Nazis, Glaub escaped facing justice at the Nuremburg Commission following the end of World War II. A Soviet military unit had attacked Glaub's facility during the war. Realizing Glaub's potential, the unit chose to transport him to the Soviet Union. Glaub spent fifteen years in the Soviet Union, where he was ordered to make steroids for their athletes. He fled the USSR sometime in the 1960s, taking Max Zorin with him. Glaub gave himself the false identity of ""Carl Mortner"" and resumed his work in genetics, now working on horses. He had discovered a way to make horses faster without doping. Glaub used Zorin's microchips in the brains of horses, which acted as receiver for a silver-tipped cane. Zorin used the cane as a remote control, pointing it at a running horse which would cause its brain to release adrenaline, and thus run faster. He covered up his activity by falsely claiming the horses got their abilities through complex selective breeding.
Then in May 1985, an MI6 agent, James Bond, began to sniff Zorin in their stable and Glaub intrigue a Bond's colleague, Sir Godfrey Tibbett. The doctor meet Bond as he leaves Max Zorin's study, pretending to be looking for the bar. As the doctor escorts Bond to where he should be, Bond asks him about how Zorin's horses always seem to win, and is introduced to another henchman, Bob Conley, and Zorin himself.
He later appears after Bond breaks into Zorin's lab and tells Zorin that 007 has been snooping around in places he shouldn't have been as he discovered that a microchip has been misplaced in the cabinet due to Bond's hastiness during his escape from the lab. 
Mortner subsequently travels to San Francisco and colludes in Zorin's plan to cause an artificial double-earthquake; permanently submerging Silicon Valley underwater and granting Zorin Industries a monopoly in microchip production. He meets his death shortly after Bond and Zorin have their final fight on the Golden Gate Bridge. He awakens after having been knocked unconscious by Stacey Sutton into the Zorin’s airship immediately before the fight. When Mortner sees Zorin fall to his death from the bridge, he reacts violently, pulling out a pistol and firing at Bond and Sutton in retaliation for the death of his adopted son. Once his pistol runs out of ammunition, he goes into a cabinet, pulls out a small bundle of dynamite, lights the fuse, and walks toward the cabin door, seeking to throw the dynamite at Bond and Sutton. Bond, however, uses Zorin's axe to cut through the rope anchoring the blimp to the bridge, causing Mortner to lose his balance and drop the dynamite in the cabin as the blimp floats away. Scarpine, who has just regained consciousness, panics and tries to wrestle the dynamite away from Mortner and extinguish the fuse, but it explodes while they are fighting over it, destroying the blimp's cabin and killing both of the men (who would have died when they fell into the San Francisco Bay even if they somehow survived the explosion).

667,/wiki/Death_is_Forever,"Death is Forever, first published in 1992, was the twelfth novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond (including Gardner's novelization of Licence to Kill). Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam.
Death is Forever is significant as the first James Bond novel to be published after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, two elements that were part and parcel of Bond's creation 40 years earlier.
The aftermath of the Cold War plays a vital role in the plot of Death is Forever. After two British agents working in Germany die under mysterious and surprisingly old-fashioned circumstances, James Bond and CIA agent Elizabeth Zara (""Easy"") St. John are assigned to track down the surviving members of ""Cabal"", a Cold War-era intellgience network that received a mysterious and unauthorized signal to disband. Soon, Bond finds himself playing a life-or-death game of ""Who do You Trust?"" as he and Easy work to track down the power responsible for killing off Cabal's members one-by-one.
More so than most other Gardner novels, Death is Forever is grounded in current events, with the fall out from the ending of the Cold War and the failed 1991 Russian coup being important backdrops to the story. The Eurotunnel connecting England and France, which was still under construction at the time the book was written, also serves as a major setting.

673,/wiki/GoldenEye_007_(2010_game),"GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter video game published by Activision. It is a reimagining of 1997 video game GoldenEye 007, itself based on the 1995 film GoldenEye. The game was officially announced by Nintendo at their E3 2010 conference presentation. The game was released on November 2, 2010 in tandem with another James Bond game, James Bond 007: Blood Stone. It took on the elements of a modern shooter while retaining a classic name. A remastering of the Wii game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in 2011, re-titled as GoldenEye 007: Reloaded.
Although Pierce Brosnan starred as James Bond in GoldenEye' and was featured in the 1997 game GoldenEye 007, subsequent Bond actor Daniel Craig's likeness and voice are featured in the 2010 game and the plot has been modified to fit with the current style of James Bond films. Judi Dench, who has portrayed M since GoldenEye, reprises her role for the game. With the exception of M, all other main characters from the film have had their appearances altered, though they still retain their original names.
Unlike the original video game and therefore movie, the whole story takes place after the Cold War due to the Soviet Union's replacement by the Russian Federation, so the story does not jump nine years ahead after the opening sequence. 
Since the release of Spectre, the events of the game have been contradictory and are rendered as non-canon.
The story is set some time after the events of Quantum of Solace but prior to Skyfall.  It begins with James Bond (007) and Alec Trevelyan (006) on a mission infiltrating a chemical weapons facility in Arkhangelsk, Russia, which is believed to be the source of weapons used by a terrorist cell to target British embassies around the world. The mission goes awry when Trevelyan is caught and apparently shot by General Arkady Ourumov. Bond escapes by detonating explosives he had placed throughout the facility, and fighting his way out, with playable options to use the facility's missile embankments to destroy attacking helicopters before stealing a motorcycle and chasing a plane on the runway. With its pilot killed in the firefight, Bond is forced to chase it off a cliff and steady the controls, fleeing Arkhangelsk.
Afterward, Bond reports on his mission, and receives intel on a phone call intercepted from Ourumov connects him to Russian gangster Valentin Zukovsky as Ourumov attempts to acquire a helicopter that has been modified to survive an electromagnetic pulse attack. Bond travels to Zukovsky's nightclub in Barcelona, Spain, and through Sergeant Garcia local police mole placed inside Zukovsky's nightclub, Bond is able to make contact with the Russian and inquires about the helicopter. Zukovsky directs him to an arms fair in Dubai before being killed by Xenia Onatopp, disguised as a waitress in Zukovsky's club and has the murder pinned on Bond.
Bond tracks Onatopp to the same arms fair Zukovsky mentioned, but is unable to stop Onatopp and Ourumov from stealing the EMP-resistant helicopter. He is, however, able to plant his smartphone on-board, and MI6 is able to track the helicopter to Severnaya, a remote base in Siberia which the Russians claim is being used to observe the effects of climate change. In reality, it is a tracking system for ""GoldenEye"", a series of nuclear weapons in orbit designed to disable an enemy target with an electromagnetic pulse upon detonation, except for Bond's new smart phone that was EMP hardened. Bond is unable to stop the theft of the GoldenEye weapons satellite, with Ourumov detonating one of the satellites in orbit so as to cover up the theft. Negotiating his way through the lower levels of the Severnaya facility, Bond rescues Natalya Simonova before being arrested by the Russian army.
Believing Bond and Natalya to be responsible for the GoldenEye blast, Russian Defense Minister Dmitri Mishkin interrogates the two in St. Petersburg, but is interrupted by Ourumov - now working for The Janus Group, a shadowy PMC, murders Mishkin and abducts Natalya. Bond pursues Ourumov through the Russian military archives, before hijacking a tank and chasing Ourumov. Ourumov leads Bond to a rail yard where he boards a train with Xenia. Bond derails their carriage by crashing into it with the tank, leading to a confrontation with Ourumov over his plan for the GoldenEye satellite. He attempts to pit Ourumov and Xenia against one another, but Xenia betrays Ourumov and kills him. Bond is able to help Natalya off the train before it explodes and Natalya admits she overheard Ourumov arranging a meeting with someone for that night.
Bond goes to the meeting in Ourumov's place and is shocked to learn that Trevelyan survived his execution at the hands of Ourumov and is now Janus, the head of the Janus crime syndicate and the mastermind behind the GoldenEye theft. Trevelyan expresses disdain for his previous life, claiming that where they once fought for Queen and country, their cause had become corrupted by bankers and financiers seeking to make billions of dollars in profit by manipulating the course of governments around the world. He then leaves with Natalya, who is instrumental to his plan now that Ourumov is dead.
MI6 traces Trevelyan to a solar energy station in Nigeria. Bond is able to infiltrate the facility, killing Xenia in the process. Trevelyan's plan is to steal billions of dollars from all the banks in London and everything the banks have touched (stock markets, financial records, etc.) before detonating the second GoldenEye satellite, erasing all evidence of the theft, using Natalia's fingerprint; Bond, however, is able to trick him into destroying his own supercomputers before telling Natalya to deorbit the satellite. Trevelyan then makes his way to the top of the satellite array to defend the override module that will sabotage it; after fighting Trevelyan, Bond is able to overload the facility control room, causing the entire facility to collapse around them. Bond shoots Trevelyan, sending him to his death over the edge of the tower. Natalya has a helicopter piloted by a Janus man at gunpoint to pick up James and they soon get away as the station is destroyed. Landing a few miles from the station, MI6 arrest the pilot while James and Natalia get out and look at each other before being interrupted by M's phone call, congratulating him about the station's destruction and wants a report. Natalia throws the smart phone away and James and Natalia soon kiss.
Since GoldenEye 007 serves as a re-imagining of the film, rather than an accurate portrayal, the game does have some noticeable differences. Levels have been altered to reflect the game's modified story. According to Craig Harris of IGN, ""GoldenEye still retains the basics of GoldenEye's story, but retells it in a way that makes sense with Daniel Craig's interpretation of James Bond."" Likewise, the game features modern game elements to coincide with other modern first person shooters, such as destructible environments and online multiplayer.
Eurocom has also added a few updated features while retaining some features from the original game. Instead of a watch, players use a mobile phone to scan documents, take photos, and communicate with MI6. The original GoldenEye 007 featured a cheat menu which is available from the start in the re-make. The game updates the AI-Bot system which is built upon Eurocom's previous game, Dead Space: Extraction. Each computer player possesses its own AI-bot system to make them dynamic and challenging. The game, despite having a regenerating health system, contains a throw back to the orginial GoldenEye 007's health system with the 007 Classic single player difficulty. In this single player mode, the player has non-regenerating health and can pick up armor like in the classic GoldenEye.
The game offers players several choices of controllers: Wii Remote with Nunchuk, Wii Zapper, Classic Controller, Classic Controller Pro, or a Nintendo GameCube controller. GoldenEye 007 also provides players using the Remote with Nunchuk or Wii Zapper with the ability to peer around cover by tilting the Nunchuk. The game includes twenty-five weapons based upon counterparts from the Bond franchise.
GoldenEye 007 features both offline split screen for up to four local players and online play for up to eight players. There are 10 multiplayer maps. There are four different game modes for offline multiplayer and nine different game modes for online multiplayer. Online multiplayer is provided through the free Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, and though up to eight players can connect to a game remotely, only one local player is allowed at a time. Multiplayer includes characters from the single player campaign, such as James Bond and Alec Trevelyan, as well as classic Bond-series characters including Jaws, Oddjob, and Julius No. Additionally, online multiplayer offers XP progression, unlockables and multipliers. Split screen combat provides over a dozen modifiers, including Paintball Mode from the original game.
During November 2006, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime announced that Nintendo was exploring the possibility of adding the Nintendo 64 classic GoldenEye 007 to the Virtual Console, despite a complicated situation in which the game's developer Rare is owned by Microsoft (producers of the rival Xbox 360 console) and the video game rights to the James Bond franchise are held by Activision. He stated, ""We would love to see it [on the Virtual Console], so we're exploring all the rights issues. On January 7, 2008, Xbox Evolved reported that an updated version of GoldenEye 007 would be released on Xbox Live Arcade. However on January 11, 2008, 1UP.com reported that a GoldenEye port (as opposed to a remake) had been in development at Rare for several months, but stated that the title would not be released on the [[Wikipedia:Xbox Live Arcade]|Xbox Live Arcade]] since ""Microsoft and Nintendo couldn't agree on the financial side of things"". As of November 2011, Microsoft has made no comment on further effort to acquire the rights to the game and release GoldenEye 007 on XBLA. It was revealed at E3 2010 that a new Goldeneye video game would be released for the Wii in November 2010. GoldenEye 007 is built on a modified version of the game engine from another Wii game by Eurocom, Dead Space: Extraction.
Originally, Free Radical Design (now Crytek UK) were approached by Activision to develop the game because former Rare staff were working there, however the deal was never finalised.
David Arnold, composer of every Bond film score since Tomorrow Never Dies, composed the game's score. Nicole Scherzinger performs the title song, a cover version of the film's theme which was originally performed by Tina Turner. The game's script is penned by Bruce Feirstein. Rory Kinnear reprises his role as Bill Tanner, M's Chief of Staff.
Reviews for GoldenEye 007 have been mostly positive. GameRankings's aggregated review score for the game is 83.77% as of May 4, 2011, based on 62 reviews, about 13% less than the original game. IGN awarded the game a 9.0 out of 10 and an Editor's Choice Award, praising its multiplayer component and its well-crafted story while criticizing the lack of voice chat. The reviewer, Craig Harris, concluded by acknowledging that the game—as of its release—is the Wii's best first person shooter. Gaming Nexus gave GoldenEye 007 an A–, stating, ""instead of standing in the original GoldenEye's shadow, Eurocom has created a brand new game that is just as compelling and addictive as the original."" GameSpot reviewer Tom McShea also praised the game, awarding it an 8.5 out of 10. Joystiq scored the game 4 out of 5. Nintendo World Report awarded the game an 8.5/10, with the reviewer stating, ""Frankly, I haven't seen a more impressive Wii shooter."" The Official Nintendo Magazine gave GoldenEye 007 a score of 90%. GameTrailers scored the game at 8.6 of 10, indicating that while most aspects are well-done, the game's performance suffers from inconsistent framerates, particularly during splitscreen play. They also derided the menus as ""bland"" and the ""not very crisp"" overall picture due to aliasing. Digital Trends' gave the game 8 of 10, complaining of the enemy AI's simplistic strategies and lack of adaptability. While the multiplayer gameplay was highly praised by the reviewer, the lack of voice chat was seen as a significant omission.
GamesRadar, although less positive, were still pleased with the result, awarding the game a 7 out of 10, stating that it was impossible for the game to live up to the original, but that it was still ""a damn fine, 'serious' shooter on the Wii, and that's saying something,"" adding that ""even without the limited options for mature action for Wii owners, GoldenEye 007 is a solid game in its own right."" In contrast, however, Game Informer was less impressed, giving the game a 6.5/10, calling it ""a lackluster game that fails to hit the same high notes of the original, or keep pace with modern shooters"".

At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Activision unveiled GoldenEye 007: Reloaded, a remastering of the Wii game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles. The game features high-definition graphics due to running on a new game engine, an achievement system, new ""Mi6 Ops Missions"", and PlayStation Move compatibility for the PS3 version. On September 14, 2011, Activision announced plans to release an exclusive PlayStation 3 bundle called GoldenEye 007: Reloaded - Double 'O' Edition, which would include access to the downloadable character Hugo Drax. The bundle would include a PlayStation Move motion controller, navigation controller, PlayStation Eye camera, and Sharp Shooter peripheral along with the game. The game was released on November 1, 2011 in North America and on November 4, 2011 in Europe.
GoldenEye 007 features online play for up to 16 players. There are 14 multiplayer maps. There are nine different game modes for online multiplayer. Online multiplayer can be used by Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, and though up to 16 players can connect to a game remotely, only one local player is allowed at a time.

677,/wiki/General_Ourumov_(Laurence_Possa),"General Arkady Ourumov is commander of the Russian Space Division, a member of the Janus Syndicate and one of the primary villains in the 2010 James Bond video-game GoldenEye 007. He was portrayed by Laurence Possa, who would also provide the voice of Stefan Pomerov in the video-game Blood Stone.
In the 2010 remake of GoldenEye 007, General Ourumov has a broader bodily frame, shorter hair and wears dark grey military clothing instead of green. MI6 discovers that Ourumov has been receiving large cash transfers that trace back to a Nigerian shell corporation, the Janus Group. At the start of the game, Bond and Trevelyan (006) are briefed by M on their infiltration of the Arkangelsk Chemical Weapons Facility, commandeered by Ourumov. The general himself had been stealing Russian military equipment and selling it on the black market, and he plans to sell a sample of high-tech weapons to a terrorist organization arriving on that day.
Bond and Trevelyan sneak into the facility and Bond eventually plants timed explosives on a number of fuel tanks, but later discovers that Ourumov has captured Trevelyan and has him at gunpoint. Ourumov threatens to kill Trevelyan if Bond does not throw down his weapon, but Bond takes refuge behind a stack of fuel canisters. One of Ourumov's soldiers tries to shoot Bond, but the general tells him not to for the fear of blowing them up. After a second soldier tries to fire at Bond, Ourumov shoots them. Bond eventually drops his gun and raises his hands, but Ourumov shoots Trevelyan anyway, then walks towards Bond to eliminate him as well. Before he can fire though, Bond sets off the timed explosives on the fuel tanks and catches Ourumov and his soldiers off guard, giving Bond the chance to escape.
Following the destruction of the Arkangelsk Facility and the loss of Janus' EMP hardened helicopter, Ouromov attempts to procure a second helicopter via Russian gangster Valentin Zukovsky. Zukovsky points him in the direction of the annual Dubai arms fair. Ourumov and Xenia enter Dubai using fake passports, murder the head of security at the arms fair, Sky Briggs, and attempt to steal the EMP-hardened helicopter being unveiled onboard the carrier. Bond tries to stop them but fails.
When Bond and Natalya Simonova are being interrogated by Defence Minister Dmitri Mishkin in the Archives level, Ourumov bursts into the room fearing Bond will reveal too much information about him and his plans. Therefore, he kills Mishkin and frames Bond for the murder, then takes Natalya hostage before leaving the archives. Bond manages to escape from Mishkin's guards, and as Ourumov makes off with Natalya in his car, Bond hijacks a tank and chases the general through the streets of St. Petersburg. After causing much destruction, Bond eventually reaches a station where Ourumov takes Natalya on board a train. Just before it leaves, Bond drives the tank into one of the carriages and derails it, then deals with a great number of Ourumov's soldiers.
After eventually boarding the train, Bond confronts Ourumov and Xenia Onatopp in one of the carriages. Ourumov arrogantly taunts Bond, thinking that this time he will not escape, and Xenia then asks him for the GoldenEye controller. The general claims that this was not part of their plan, that he was supposed to give the controller to Alec Trevelyan, and therefore refuses, at which point Xenia uses the gun she is holding to fire a single shot into Ourumov's heart, killing him. Ourumov's body is incinerated when Xenia Onatopp blows up the train.

678,/wiki/Andrew_Bond,"Andrew Bond is the father of James Bond and the spouse of Monique Bond. Like his wife, the character has only a brief mention in Fleming's penultimate novel, You Only Live Twice. Although alluded to in 1995's GoldenEye and 2012's Skyfall, he has never been portrayed in film. His role in James' life has been expanded upon in the many novels following Ian Fleming's death, most notably the Young Bond series, and Jeffery Deaver's 2012 novel Carte Blanche.
In the novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service Bond reluctantly relays to professional genealogist Sir Hilary Bray that his father was a Scot from the Highlands near Glencoe and he has no living relatives.
It was not until the penultimate novel, You Only Live Twice, that Ian Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background, using a fictional obituary, purportedly from The Times. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories. The novel reveals Bond is the son of a Scottish father, Andrew Bond, of Glencoe, and a Swiss mother, Monique Delacroix, of the Canton de Vaud. The young James Bond spends much of his early life abroad, becoming multilingual in German and French because of his father's work as a Vickers armaments company representative. When his parents are killed in a tragic mountain climbing accident in the Aiguilles Rouges near Chamonix, eleven-year-old James is orphaned.
After being poisoned by being force-fed Gin and passing out on a boat, James Bond recalled that his father had been an adept sailor, and that they had enjoyed sailing together, despite Andrew's being absent for longer than James would have liked him to be. On one occasion while teaching James to sail, They were returning to port, and James had his hand over the side of the boat, despite Andrew's previously instructing him not to. Because of this, James got his fingers smashed by the pier and gave an immense howl, which Andrew considered to be his son ""being an ass"".
In Jeffery Deaver's continuity, Andrew Bond worked for an arms company, and would often take the young James Bond with him on business trips and allow him to sit in on meetings. Andrew was killed when his wife was assassinated by a Soviet spy killing operation called a Steel Cartridge.
The resulting police investigation resulted in the operation being declared as a tragic accident, they did find a chrome cartridge of bullets in the snowdrift that appeared to kill them. While its presence was never explained, It was left by the Soviet operative as a warning to the SIS.
Alec Trevelyan reminds James how he was orphaned when his parents died in a climbing accident.
He resided in Skyfall Lodge before his death alongside his wife, leaving James distraught. After that, his primary caretaker became Kincade, the gamekeeper of Skyfall Lodge. He and his wife are buried nearby in the graveyard of the estate's chapel. James does not like to talk about his roots or his parents.
Aside from his home, his only notable possession was a gun collection maintained by Kincade. Following James' supposed demise in Turkey, the guns were sold off to an American collector. The only one to remain was Andrew's engraved hunting rifle, which James initially used when Skyfall came under attack.

Their fate is unknown but the two most likely perished in the blast that destroyed Malprave's base. One of the two appears as a playable character in the game's multiplayer, simply identified as Twin.

Before Bond is about to end the phone call, Kirchtum interrupts him, and suddenly Miss Moneypenny is on the line telling him that she would like to visit May with him. Bond thanks her for the thoughtful consideration, and ends the phone call. 
After being informed about the Head Hunt, Bond receives a telephone call from Herr Doktor Kirchtum that May and Moneypenny had been kidnapped. After an encounter with Heinrich Osten and his associates, Bond learns from Kommissar Becker that Kirchtum was informed of May and Moneypenny's kidnapping four days later. Suddenly, a phone rings from a frightened Kirchtum telling Bond that a gun is being pointed to his left ear, and he reads a message ordering Bond to transport Sukie and Nannie to the Hotel Goldener Hirsch where a room is booked for them and to wait there for further instructions, as well as not to inform the police or his intelligence contacts of his movements. Suddenly, a tape recording of May and Moneypenny in panic is played over the phone. 
After the flight lands in Miami, Quinn and Kirchtum escort Bond to a sleek dark automobile that drives them to a forty-foot powered fishing boat with its route headed for the Gulf of Mexico. Suddenly, Quinn, Kirchtum, and the boat captain are killed by Sukie and Norrich. Their bodies are incinerated along with the ships via emergency fuel and explosive bullets.

685,/wiki/Die_Another_Day_(novelisation),"A few months after its publication, it was announced that Benson was retiring as the official James Bond novelist, and Ian Fleming Publications (owners of the Bond literary franchise) announced that the series was going on hiatus, making Die Another Day the final release in the series that relaunched with Licence Renewed in 1981. A new series of Bond novels by Charlie Higson was launched in 2005, although these books focused on Bond's adventures as a teenager (Young Bond), and a trilogy of books by Kate Westbrook, The Moneypenny Diaries, launched around the same time.
As a result, Die Another Day, the novel, was the final literary adventure featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming, until the publisher released another ""adult Bond"" novel to coincide with the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth in 2008, Devil May Care.

Everything or Nothing includes 29 missions as well as 4 unlockable bonus missions, numerous gadgets supplied by Q and the return of the Aston Martin V12 Vanquish from the 2002 film Die Another Day, which is considered as a continuation to the film.
James Bond Everything or Nothing opens in the mountains of Tajikistan where an arms trade is about to begin. The merchandise is a nuclear suitcase-bomb that was stolen from a stockpile of old Soviet Union weapons. James Bond is tasked with making sure that the trade is not completed. After Bond completes the mission, he is extracted via helicopter outside of the military base.
Afterwards, a Russian female scientist, named Dr. Katya Nadanova, of the Oxford Department of Microtechnology is kidnapped by a terrorist cell and is taken to their headquarters in southern Egypt. Her invention, a new kind of microtechnology used to enter electrical wires and repair damage at microscopic level, is also stolen. James Bond is once again called in to action. He destroys the stolen technology and chases after the terrorist's train managing to board stealthfully. Aboard, Bond has a confrontation with his old enemy: Jaws. The two fight and Bond wins. Arriving at an helipad-vagon, Bond sees Nadanova trapped with handcuffs at this vagon. The general escapes by helicopter and blows up a bridge, putting Bond and Nadanova into a trap. But there's still an helicopter, so they manage to escape before the train falls down the valley. They fly through the Valley of the Kings until Bond finally shoots the leader down. Bond drops off Katya at a nearby military complex, although unbeknownst to Bond, Katya meets with a Russian ex-KGB special officer turned businessman, named Nikolai Diavolo - the former protege of Max Zorin. During the meeting Katya delivers a small vial containing a mysterious substance to Diavolo.
Later, MI6 loses contact with 003, sent to investigate the mining of newly-discovered platinum reserves in western Peru. Bond is sent to a town on the Northwestern Peruvian coastline, located high above the Pacific Ocean on a series of cliffs. Bond learns that 003's last contact was with an American geologist named Serena St. Germaine. They meet and she takes him to the mining complex near ancient Incan ruins. Once there, Bond discovers 003 had been violently questioned by Nikolai Diavolo. Bond makes himself known to Diavolo and after shooting 003, Diavolo orders the guards to chase him through the mining complex and ruins. When Bond reaches 003 he tells Bond that Diavolo sets his plans in New Orleans but dies of blood loss. At the end of the mining tunnels, Bond reaches a cliff where a helicopter appears with Katya Nadanova in it, holding Serena hostage. She throws Serena out of the copter and Bond dives off the cliff after her. Dodging obstacles and enemy fire, he finally catches Serena and fires a grappling hook into the cliff wall. Upon returning to the town, Bond and Serena are met with military forces who are being paid off by Diavolo to protect him. Bond quickly returns Serena to her cottage in the dense forest, and goes on to reach the extraction point. Bond drives into a moving plane just as the military catches up with him.
MI6 had learned that Diavolo had employed an Interpol-sought war criminal named Arkady Yayakov. Yayakov secretly owns a night club in New Orleans along with the a local crime ring. Bond goes to New Orleans during Mardi Gras and stealthfully enters the night club where he meets Mya Starling, an NSA agent assigned to spy on Yayakov. Chaos erupts when Bond enters the main lounge of the club and Agent Starling's cover is blown. Yayakov kidnaps the NSA agent and leaves the club. Bond fights the thugs and chases Yayakov through an underground tunnel system that was used to traffic drugs and suchlike. Yayakov, Starling and Bond arrive in a gigantic 19th century graveyard. Yayakov hands over Agent Starling to Jean Le Rouge, a local mobster. Le Rouge and Bond run through the graveyard until they reach a crematorium where they have the final fight. Bond kills Le Rouge and saves Starling.
Bond is then sent to a remote area further north outside of New Orleans. At a secret lab inside an old, run-down villa, Bond discovers that Diavolo is using Yayakov to manipulate the purpose of Dr. Nadanova's microtechnology. They have managed to create a brand new weapon of mass destruction: microtechnology, infused with a natural chemical compound found only in the bayous of Louisiana, that literally eats away at all kinds of metal - save for platinum. Bond destroys the lab, killing Yayakov in the process but Jaws suddenly appears and smashes through the old villa, driving a platinum tanker truck filled with the metal-eating nanobots. Jaws' orders are to crash the truck into the levees that surround New Orleans and let the nanobots go to work destroying the levees, thus flooding New Orleans. Bond hops onto a motorcycle and chases Jaws across the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway and finally rams the truck off the bridge and into the lake below.
Later, MI6 learns that the operation in New Orleans was meant to be a test run for the metal-eating nanobots. James Bond returns to Peru to investigate what Diavolo plans to do with his new weapon. With the help of Serena St. Germaine, Bond infiltrates Diavolo's personal estate and covertly enters himself in a rally car race. The reward for coming in at first place is dinner with Diavolo. Naturally, Bond wins. However, Diavolo has already caught on to Bond's snooping around, and has both Bond and Serena captured. Bond breaks loose and manages to rescue Serena, killing a large number of Diavolo's henchmen in the process. Back together, Bond and Serena hijack one of the race cars and speed through town. Bond wants to see Diavolo's platinum mines first-hand. They go to the mines and Bond investigates. It is there when he learns of Nadanova's treachery and Bond escapes the mine, leaping through a hole in the rock where Serena is waiting in a helicopter.
Now in Russia, Diavolo uses his platinum army to break through to Red Square in Moscow and attempts to release toxic gas into the Kremlin. Preventing this, Bond discovers that there is a nuclear bunker under the Kremlin. Diavolo plans to launch several long-since decommissioned ballistic missiles - replacing their missing warheads with metal-eating Nanotech payloads. Rappelling down a large elevator shaft, 007 is confronted by Nadanova and escapes from her men by shooting out the elevator's brakes. As the platform plummets out of control, Bond and a flamethrower-wielding Jaws battle each-other; concluding with the spy using an aircraft's ejector seat to escape. The elevator violently crashes and Bond safely parachutes to the bottom of the shaft. He proceeds into the bunker and deactivates the missiles. While returning to the surface via the freight elevator, Diavolo and Nadanova attack Bond from an adjacent shaft using a Russian hoverjet. Bond destroys it, killing Nadanova, but Diavolo manages to eject just in time.
Diavolo makes his way to the surface, where he manually reactivates one of the missiles using a telemetry tower and aims it at London. Fighting through his remaining men, Bond destabilises the tower using a rocket launcher, causing Diavolo to plunge into the fiery missile silo below. However, Diavolo manages to press the launch button before falling and Bond is forced to use a nearby anti-aircraft turret to shoot down the missile. Catastrophe averted, 007 meets Serena outside the Kremlin and embraces her.

693,/wiki/Colonel_Sun,"Colonel Sun was the first continuation James Bond novel published after the 1964 death of Ian Fleming. Published in 1968 by Glidrose Productions, it was written by ""Robert Markham"", a pseudonym created by Glidrose for British novelist Kingsley Amis. Glidrose had intended publishing a series of James Bond novels written by different authors under the Robert Markham name, but Colonel Sun was the only novel published.
Discounting the two screenplay novelisations by Christopher Wood, and James Bond: The Authorised Biography of 007 (1973), by John Pearson, Colonel Sun was the last, new James Bond novel published until Licence Renewed, by John Gardner in 1981.
It is often claimed that Amis requested Colonel Sun not be filmed, however an introductory chapter to the Titan Books 2005 reprint of the Colonel Sun comic strip reveals that, quite the contrary, Amis approached EON Productions (home production company of the Bond film franchise) in 1976-77 with the idea of his novel being adapted as a future Bond film. According to Titan Books, however, Amis was told that Harry Saltzman (co-producer of the Bond series up until 1974) had ""blackballed"" any use of Colonel Sun as a Bond film, apparently in response to Glidrose having rejected the publication of the post-Fleming Bond novel, Per Fine Ounce, which Saltzman had championed.
Nonetheless, the novel may have inspired elements of several James Bond films, such as the Greek setting of For Your Eyes Only (1981), the kidnapping of M in The World Is Not Enough (1999). The name of the North Korean villain of Die Another Day (2002), Colonel Tan-Sun Moon, is acknowledged on the film's DVD release as having been a nod to Colonel Sun. However the most significant reference occurs in 2015's Spectre which directly adapted a torture sequence from the novel, resulting in a screen credit for Amis' estate.
Amis' identity as Robert Markham was never kept secret; the very first UK hardcover and US paperback editions (though not the Pan Books paperback) identify him on the cover, and several recent editions solely credit Amis with no mention of the Markham pseudonym.
The 1970 Pan Books paperback edition featured a photograph of a model portraying the titular villain; according to 007 Magazine, the model was actor Vincent Wong, who appeared in seven James Bond films in supporting roles, most notably as General Li in Die Another Day, a film that, as noted above, took some character inspiration from this novel.
Head of the British Secret Service, M, is violently kidnapped from home, but James Bond manages to escape the kidnappers who waited for his arrival. Following a lead to Greece, he deliberately walks into the trap set by the beautiful Ariadne Alexandrou, a Greek working for the Reds. The agents team up, with the Soviets worried about a forthcoming 'event'. Meanwhile, the British Head of Station disappears. Bond and Ariadne, who by now are lovers follow a lead to Vrakonisi, a small island off Greece where Chinese agent Colonel Sun Liang-Tan is holding M. Ariadne enlists an old friend, Niko Litsas who wishes revenge on former Nazi officer Von Richter for his World War II atrocities.
Litsas and Bond overpower a guard ship meant to prevent their reaching the island, where a Russian-led peace conference is taking place and Bond fears it will be attacked by the Chinese, with his and M's bodies left nearby so that everyone will presume they were responsible. Ariadne proves unable to convince Russian General Arenski of the plot, but he sets up a plan to lure Bond which 007 doesn't fall for. Bond then sees Sun and Von Richter setting up for their attack on the Russians from Sun's neighbouring house, where they deduce M is being held.
They attack by night but are captured. Sun then viciously tortures Bond in preparation for dumping his body, but one of his disgusted female helpers cuts Bond's bonds without the villain seeing. Bond stabs Sun and frees the others, killing Sun's henchmen and preventing von Richter from firing the mortar enough to hit the conference. Litsas finishes the German off, but Bond finds that Sun has survived the stabbing and now plans to come at Bond with a grenade. Bond reaches safety and finally stabs Sun through the heart.
Colonel Sun has the distinction of being the only non-Fleming James Bond novel adapted as a comic strip by the British newspaper, the Daily Express, and also syndicated worldwide. The strip ran from December 1, 1969 to August 20, 1970; adapted by Jim Lawrence with artwork by Yaroslav Horak. A notable difference between the novel and the strip is that the main villain, Colonel Sun, is an agent of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. in the strip.
Colonel Sun was reprinted by Titan Books in December 2005. Included in the collection, also titled Colonel Sun was River Of Death, an original James Bond strip published prior to Colonel Sun strip in 1969.

Having lost his hands through his experiments with radioactivity, Dr. Julius No had them replaced with black robotic hands, granting him increased strength, although his manual dexterity became limited.
Upon capturing James Bond and Honey Ryder, Dr. No greeted them personally and invited them for dinner, during which he noted his prosthetic hands while commenting on his work with radioactivity, simply noting that his work had come with some personally cost. Mockingly, Bond questioned if toppling of American missles compensated for having no hands, which Dr. No ignored. As Bond persited in annoying Dr. No, he demonstrated his hands' strength by crushing a statue, before having Bond and Ryder seperated so he could continue with his work, with Bond being beaten by his guards.
As Dr. No prepared to complete his scheme to electronically sabotage the U.S. Project Mercury spaceflight program on behalf of SPECTRE, his efforts were sabotaged by Bond, who caused a meltdown across Crab Key. Enraged, Dr. No confronted Bond himself, striking him repeatedly with his robotic hands. However, in their ensuing struggle, the two men fell onto a platform descending into the bubbling reactor coolant. Bond managed to climb to safety, but Dr. No's was unable to pull himself up using his prosthetics, and was subsequently boiled to death as he slowly fell into the radioactive water.

Kress was the leader of an Italian mob that kidnapped MI6 Agent 0013 and framed her as a spy for Chinese Communists. He and his men then smuggled 0013 to Italy where they left her with a fake Canadian passport and tickets to England. Kress then enlisted the help of Ivor Lambert to steal maps to the locations of major ore strike from Magnus Mining, and sell them back to Sir William Magnus for 100,000 pounds. He soon finds Agent 007 and 0013 sneaking into their base of operations, and he left them bound and gagged in the care of Dr. Lambert, while he revealed to Magnus that he was instead planning to auction off the maps to other mining companies. 007 then emerged into the room and held the men at gunpoint while he called the police. The three were then arrested.

697,/wiki/Corinne_Veneau_(Stana_Katic),"Intelligence ServiceCorinne Veneau is a fictional Canadian intelligence operative who appears in the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace. She was portrayed by Stana Katic.
At the end of Quantum of Solace, Bond goes to Kazan, Russia, where he confronts Vesper Lynd's former lover, Yusef Kabira. Yusef is a member of the Quantum organization. His role is to seduce high-ranking women with valuable connections, getting them to give up government assets as ransom for himself in fake kidnappings where he is supposedly held hostage.
He is attempting to do the same with Canadian IO Corinne Veneau, even giving her the same kind of necklace (an Algerian love knot) he gave Vesper.
Surprising them at Yusef's apartment, Bond holds the Quantum operative at gunpoint. He tells Corinne about Vesper and advises her to alert CSIS to the leak. She quietly exits, leaving the two men alone, but not before whispering ""Thank You."" to James Bond, as she realizes how close she came to suffering Vesper's fate.

"
699,/wiki/Gonzales%27_Henchman_(Clive_Curtis),"Gonzales' henchman is a fictional unnamed mercenary serving under Hector Gonzales. He later takes command of Gonzales' men after his death at the hands of Melina Havelock. The minor villain appeared in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by stuntman Clive Curtis.
Handing him the PPK, Gonzales recognizes the weapon as the standard issue firearm of the British Secret Service and orders Bond to be taken away, presumably to be shot. It is at this moment that the Cuban hitman is shot in the back by Melina, who has been lurking in the woods.
In the ensuing chaos, Bond knocks one of his captors into the pool and escapes over the villa wall into the woods. The henchman manages to fire several shots at Bond, but ultimately is unable to catch him. Eventually, the spy manages to get to the relative safety of Melina's Citroën 2CV, and a car chase through the Spanish countryside ensues.
With the henchman and two cars full of mercenaries in pursuit, Bond accidentally topples the 2CV in a crowded village. As 007 and Melina (with the help of some villagers) attempt to roll the car onto its wheels, a traffic pile-up begins with a bus blocking the mercenaries' path through the cramped street. After gesturing wildly at the bus driver to reverse and clear the street, the henchman fires his pistol menacingly in the air. The threat has the desired effect, but by the time the bus has moved the 2CV is already up-righted and escaping.
Continuing the chase through winding hill roads, the henchman's car attempts to force Bond off the road twice. Although the first attempt succeeds, the second attempt fails miserably as Bond's quick braking sends the henchman's car careering into the second car behind him. The henchman's vehicle is sent tumbling down the hillside, landing on its roof on the road below. Bruised and bloodied, the henchman stares in horror as the second car hurtles around the corner, hitting the car a second time and sending its occupants spinning in circles.

700,/wiki/Baron_Samedi_(Geoffrey_Holder),"Baron Samedi is a fictional character from the James Bond novel and film Live and Let Die. In the novel, Baron Samedi is a voodoo figure with whom Mr. Big has chosen to identify himself with to inspire fear among his followers. In the film, he was a separate character and henchman to Dr. Kananga and a major antagonist. Samedi was portrayed in the screen by the late actor, dancer, choreographer and singer Geoffrey Holder.
In the novel Live and Let Die, Baron Samedi is described as the voodoo spirit of darkness and death. No such character appears in the novel, although many people in Harlem and elsewhere believe the novel's main villain, Mr. Big, to be a manifestation of Samedi himself or perhaps his zombie. Mr. Big encourages this beneficial belief by keeping a Baron Samedi totem near his desk.
Baron Samedi is perhaps the most enigmatic villain/henchman the cinematic Bond has ever faced. The character is an ambiguous one, and the audience cannot tell if he really is the Voodoo god Baron Samedi himself, or simply a mortal who has assumed Samedi's identity. Contributing to the mystery is the fact that Samedi seems to operate as an aide to Dr. Kananga aka Mr. Big, but is not entirely under his control. In one scene, for instance, as Kananga interrogates Solitaire (the film's main Bond girl), Samedi engages in an odd ritual of burning Solitaire's Tarot cards. The ritual seems to convey a sinister message to Kananga and Solitaire, and although it irritates Kananga, he refuses to put a stop to Samedi's card-burning.
Baron Samedi is first introduced as a so-called entertainer who does a voodoo dance act for tourists, fatly laughing multiple times, when Bond arrives at the island on which most of the action takes place. The announcer introduces Samedi as an ""immortal"", though obviously neither Bond nor the viewer seem to think much of it at the time.
While on the way to Kananga's heroin fields on San Monique, Bond and Solitaire stumble across a small abbey in the woods. There, Samedi, now without makeup, coat and hat, sits on a tombstone and greets the two. He gives the appearance of a friendly native, playing a flute and telling the couple he feels it is going to be a beautiful day for them. Bond and Solitaire continue their journey and after they are out of sight, Samedi warns Kananga with a radio built into his flute, telling the drug lord that ""they're heading for the hill"".
After Bond has been captured in New Orleans and been brought to the crocodile farm, Samedi, now dressed in a black suit, meets with Kananga while the latter confronts Solitaire for her betrayal as he wants to know why she betrayed him although he gave her everything and she lacked for nothing. She tells him that the cards foresaw it. Kananga angrily smacks the medium to the ground, telling her that in proper time he would have given her love and that she knew that. The villain says that there is only one appropriate way to deal with this betrayal, to which Samedi draws the tarot card 'Death', laughing maniacally. This is then followed by Kananga also declaring there is one proper time to administer it, and on cue, Samedi draws another tarot card, this one the card 'Midnight'.
Samedi is encountered again when Kananga orders Solitaire to be executed during a voodoo ceremony, a fate that befell Baines. Though it initially seems that Solitaire is to be killed by the bite of a poisonous snake, the henchman holding the snake backs of in the last moment. A man with a hat then approaches a tombstone nearby and leaves it on the grave. After two women drag on the tombstone with a machete three times and ring a bell, Samedi rises from the grave, with the hat on his head. Samedi blinks, indicating a go-ahead for killing Solitaire. At this point Bond reveals himself and shoots Kananga's henchmen, including the one holding the snake, before cutting the ropes holding Soltaire in place.
When shooting Samedi in the head, the head simply breaks. After shooting the body multiple times it becomes clear that it wasn't the real Samedi, but just a clay figure. After fighting more henchmen, another motionless Samedi rises from either another grave or the same one as the mannequin. Bond ignores him, deeming him another impostor, but Baron Samedi then opens his eyes widely and starts to laugh. He then takes the machete from the tombstone and engages Bond in a short fight, but Bond hits him in the stomach and knocks him back, causing Samedi to fall into the coffin full of poisonous snakes, where he is bitten multiple times. Eventually Samedi falls silent and does not move anymore, and Bond believes him dead.
Bond then uses the machete to hit the tombstone three times. It is revealed that the tomb in fact is a hidden elevator, which brings Bond and Solitaire down into Kananga's underground headquarters.
But at the very end of the film, at the point when Bond typically has achieved total victory in the Bond films, we seen Baron Samedi riding on the front of the speeding train carrying him and Solitaire, laughing demonically as the camera zooms in to focus on him while the credits start playing, further suggesting that he is in fact a supernatural character, a first (and so far only, besides Solitaire) for the Bond films.
Baron Samedi has never reappeared in any subsequent Bond film, unlike the henchmen Jaws and Mr. White or the main villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld (most likely because Samedi is inseparably connected to Voodoo and Bond never had to deal with this cult again), but neither has the series endeavored to solve the mystery of Samedi's nature. Since Samedi's last appearance was more than three decades ago, the mystery will likely remain unsolved.
Samedi appears in The Duel as one of the cloned bosses in Stage 2.
In the video game, GoldenEye 007, Samedi appears as a boss in an unlockable mission separate from the main plot as well as the game's multiplayer. In the game, Bond is sent to the ancient el-Saghira temple in the Valley of the Kings in response to a letter sent by someone claiming to be Baron Samedi. Additionally, Samedi claims to have possession of Francisco Scaramanga's Golden Gun.
Bond is sent to retrieve the legendary weapon and defeat a cackling Baron a total of three times before completing the mission. In the cutscene that follows, Bond strides down a corridor of the temple with the Golden Gun in hand. Just as he is about to leave, Samedi emerges from the shadows and laughs. However, he can be killed a fourth time during the cut scene using a glitch, but this does not result in any new cut scene.
He is also a multiplayer character in the games Nightfire, Everything or Nothing, GoldenEye 007, and 007 Legends.

701,/wiki/00,"The 00 Section of MI6 is considered the secret service's elite. A 00 (typically read ""Double O"" and denoted in Fleming's novels by the letters ""OO"" rather than the digits ""00"") is a field agent that holds a licence to kill in the field, at their discretion, to complete any mission. Standard mandatory retirement age is 45 though various writers including Ian Fleming, Sebastian Faulks and John Gardner have contradicted this as a matter of Poetic License and several actors who have portrayed Bond on film have been older than 45 at the time of playing the character. Although Fleming only mentioned five 00 agents, others have been added over the years across various franchise media.

705,/wiki/Goldeneye_Hotel_and_Resort,"Goldeneye Hotel and Resort is luxury resort property developed from the original estate of writer Ian  Fleming, Goldeneye, in Oracabessa on the island of Jamaica. Located next door to Golden Clouds estate, it is jointly owned by Island Records founder Chris Blackwell and Island Outpost, a company that owns and operates his boutique hotels.
Goldeneye was originally built by novelist Ian Fleming, who created the James Bond character and wrote all of his Bond novels while living there.
In 1976, 12 years after Fleming's death, Goldeneye was sold to reggae star Bob Marley. Shortly before his own death, Marley sold it to Island Records founder Chris Blackwell. For years he primarily used the estate as a place to entertain friends.
Rather than a traditional hotel, Goldeneye resort is a compound of tropical buildings, gardens and private beaches. It closed in 2007 for major additions and renovations, and reopened in December 2010.
Fleming's Goldeneye became the social epicenter of Jamaica's north coast along with nearby Firefly owned by Noël Coward, and Bolt House, owned by Chris Blackwell's mother, Blanche, who was a long time friend of Fleming. The property was equally popular with a coterie of Hollywood stars and British literary greats as it was British aristocrats and international heads of state. Errol Flynn, Lucian Freud, Truman Capote, Patrick Leigh Fermor, the Duchess of Devonshire, Princess Margaret, and Prime Minister Anthony Edenwere all visitors. Eden even made the property the temporary Headquarters for the British government during the Suez Crisis of 1956.
The Goldeneye of the Blackwell era has also attracted celebrities, both as his friends and resort guests. Among them Bono, Naomi Campbell, Michael Caine, Pierce Brosnan, Harrison Ford, and Richard Branson.
A tradition, which was started by Sir Anthony Eden when he and his wife, Clarissa, planted a Santa Maria tree before departing from Goldeneye, is still ongoing. Today, there are hundreds of mango, lime, orange and ackee trees in the garden. Each was planted by a guest, has a small plaque saying who planted it and when. A $1000 donation required goes to the Oracabessa Foundation.

"
708,/wiki/Ed_Killifer_(Everett_McGill),"Ed Killifer is a fictional DEA agent and colleague of Felix Leiter, who turns traitor when he accepts a $2 million bribe to free drug baron Franz Sanchez from U.S. custody. The character appears in the 1989 James Bond film Licence to Kill, portrayed by Everett McGill, and was also featured in John Gardner's accompanying novelization.
Killifer is first introduced to James Bond at the wedding of Felix and Della Leiter. Earlier that day, Bond and Leiter captured Sanchez in American airspace, to which Killifer congratulates the pair. He is later seen in a detention center, intimidating Sanchez. Killifer mockingly remarks to Sanchez he made the mistake of setting foot in the United States, and this is not South America where Sanchez could offer a $1 million bribe and be on his merry way. Sanchez then calmly up his ante, offering $2 million to the person who liberates him. Apparently infuriated, the DEA agent has to be restrained by his colleague, and angrily states that the drug lord has a prison cell awaiting him in Quantico. Sanchez is next seen as a prisoner in an armored car transporting him from Florida to Virginia, with Killifer accompanying Sanchez in the passenger seat of the cab. Without warning, Killifer takes his shotgun and buttstrokes the driver. This causes the driver to recoil in pain and lose control of the armored car, which plunges off Seven Mile Bridge into the deep waters of Key West. Sanchez and Killifer then escape in a Shark Hunter II submersible, courtesy of Sanchez's associate, Milton Krest.
Upon arriving at Krest's Ocean Exotica warehouse, Sanchez honors his bargain and pays the DEA agent with a suitcase full of cash. Krest, concerned that Killifer has seen too much, suggests that he be killed; but is rebuked by Sanchez who notes that loyalty is more important to him than money. Entering into the murky world of drug lord justice, Killifer is present at the maiming of his colleague Felix Leiter and watches as he is slowly lowered into a shark tank. Leiter, having recently been widowered due to Sanchez's men failing to kill him in an earlier hit, but managing to kill Della, is aghast that Killifer conspired with Sanchez. Killifer selfishly remarks that $2 million is too good a deal to ignore. Waiting to be picked up at Krest's warehouse, Killifer hears gunshots outside the office and finds that James Bond has disposed of two guards. Holding 007 at gunpoint with a revolver, he opens the same trap door which was used in the dunking of Leiter. Before he can shoot Bond or usher him into the tank, he is knocked off balance by Leiter's fisherman friend Sharkey, who emerges from another trap door directly below him. Bond seizes the opportunity and punches him into the shark tank. As he dangles from a rope over the water, Killifer offers to split the bribe money with Bond if he saves him. The spy refuses, telling him ""You earned it. You keep it, old buddy."" and coldly slings the case of money at him. This causes Ed Killifer to lose his balance, knocking him into the shark tank where he is killed by the same shark who mauled the man he sold out for a fast buck.

It is based on the Audi 100 model, with minor optical changes, more sporty engines and better interior.
The car used by James Bond in The Living Daylights belongs to the 'C3' generation. Although the C3 was replaced by the C4 in 1991, there was no Audi 200 C4, as Audi replaced their 200 with the new Audi V8, a full-size luxury car which eventually became the Audi A8, which is still offered today.
Comparing the Audi 200 with today's cars, the modern equivalent would be the Audi A6.
The car in the movie is an 'Exclusiv' model, the most expensive Audi ever built back in 1987.
Along with upgraded interior, the 'Exclusiv' model has a lowered suspension, sporty BBS rims and hand-crafted wheel arches. The car seen in the film is today owned by the Audi company, who keeps it in storage, and shows it to the public from time to time.
Bond uses the Vienna-registrated Audi 200 when extracting General Koskov from the CSSR. Later, Bond collects Saunders at the Austrian border with it. 
It is later seen parked in the background in Vienna, making it possible that this is actually Saunder's car.

712,/wiki/British_Airways_Flight_12_hijacking,"BA Flight 12 from Singapore to Heathrow was scheduled to collect almost $2 billion worth of gold, currency and diamonds en route in Bahrain. The Boeing 747 was protected by a British five man team consisting of Commander James Bond on the starboard side of the executive class area and four undercover SAS men spread tactically through the first, executive, and tourist classes (two fore and two aft). They were armed with airguard revolvers and (in the case of 007) throwing knives. The hijackers comprised of five men and one woman – a flight attendant who had scheduled herself on the flight and smuggled the necessary smoke grenades (disguised as drink cans) and Model II Ingram submachine guns on-board. Four men were seated in pairs in executive class with a backup man at the rear of the plane. Just prior to the hijacking attempt the stewardess distributed smoke grenade cans to two men left of Bond and a pair a few rows in front of him.
The hijackers struck whilst the plane was on its its descent into Heathrow, a few miles off the Belgian coast at Ostend, at an altitude of approximately 20,000 ft. While one of the men detonated a smoke canister in the rear executive class aisle, the stewardess simultaneously proceeded into the forward galley and returned with firearms. 007 swiftly dispatched the man with a throwing knife as the terrorists made for the forward galley and the spiral staircase that linked the lower section to the ""penthouse suite"" and flight deck. As 007 also headed forward, an SAS man shot and killed the stewardess in the galley; he was subsequently incapacitated at the foot of the staircase by Ingram fire. The two SAS men in the rear of the aircraft remained there, covering any back-up action which might have occurred. The remaining three hijackers took up places on the upper deck, with two in the cockpit and one guarding the staircase. The last Forward SAS officer concealed himself behind the upper galley bulkhead just six feet from the cockpit. Bond knifed the staircase hijacker and provided a distraction for himself and the SAS officer to finish off the remaining two intruders on the flight deck. Almost ninety seconds had passed since the first smoke bomb exploded.

Sir Fredrick Gray is the Minister of Defence for the British government. He appears alongside Bond's boss M or in his own office. In The Spy Who Loved Me he is introduced during a briefing over the submarine crisis. Bond obviously knows Gray well since he later calls him 'Freddie' during a private discussion between them. In all subsequent meetings, Bond addresses Gray as 'Minister' since other officials are present.
At the end of The Spy Who Loved Me, Gray, along with General Gogol, M and Q, witness Bond and Anya Amasova under the sheets in an escape pod. This embarrassment might explain the apparent souring of his relationship with Bond, who thereafter is treated formally and/or disdainfully.
In Moonraker, Gray is seen walking into a secret laboratory with M and Bond, all wearing gasmasks, but it is revealed embarrassingly to be nothing more than an ornamented office with Hugo Drax waiting inside to chide them. Gray – who after this angrily tells M, ""Your man should be taken off the case!"" – is again present at the end of the film to witness Bond under the sheets, this time in space with Holly Goodhead.
In For Your Eyes Only, Gray is seen alongside the Chief of Staff Bill Tanner (M is on leave) trying to find out what happened to the spy ship St. Georges. Once again, at the end of the film Gray is embarrassed, this time by linking the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with Max the (rude) Parrot instead of 007, whom he accuses of having gone mad.
In Octopussy, Gray suggests that Bond go with Jim Fanning, the art expert to see the auction of a Fabergé egg, Property of A Lady. Gray is seen at the end of the film celebrating with Gogol and M.
In A View to a Kill, the Minister is seen talking with Bond and M about Max Zorin and microchips. At the end, Gray is once again seen celebrating (though they think Bond may be dead) with M and Gogol in the former's office, this time about 007 preventing Silicon Valley from being destroyed.
In the final film that Gray appears in, The Living Daylights, he is seen with M, Bond and General Koskov at the Blayden safe house – this is Koskov's debriefing following his supposed defection. Later, Gray proclaims, ""We're the laughing stock of the intelligence community!"" when Koskov is apparently kidnapped. Reference is made to his having to explain all this to the PM: ""She'll have our guts for garters!""

He is a major antagonist in the 1989 James Bond film Licence to Kill, portrayed by famous actor Benicio del Toro, and also appeared in John Gardner's accompanying novelisation. Still portrayed by del Toro, the character would later be re-imagined for Activision's 2012 James Bond video game 007 Legends.
Dario is the youngest of Franz Sanchez's three main henchmen (the others being Perez and Braun) and arguably his favorite. A ruthless and psychotic killer, Dario was kicked out of the Nicaraguan Contras for his brutality and found his way into Sanchez's drug cartel as one of his chief enforcers.
Dario was present alongside Sanchez when the latter caught his mistress, Lupe Lamora, sleeping with another man in Florida. Sanchez ordered Dario to give Lupe the man's heart and the enforcer complied by cutting out the heart with his switchblade knife. Dario later escaped into hiding when Sanchez was arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Dario later resurfaces after Sanchez is liberated from U.S. custody by Ed Killifer and Milton Krest. Surprising them on their wedding night, the drug lord has Dario, Braun and Perez kidnap Felix Leiter and murder his wife Della. He is also culpable in the subsequent maiming of Felix by a shark.
Later on, Dario tries to assassinate one of Leiter's contacts, CIA informant Pam Bouvier, under the guise of hiring her for a job due to her piloting skills. However, the intervention of James Bond disrupts Dario's plans, leading to a bar-room brawl. As Bouvier and Bond flee on a boat moored outside, Dario shoots her in the back and grins to himself sadistically, unaware that she was wearing a kevlar vest underneath her blouse.
Dario makes his final appearance by attending a tour of Sanchez's cocaine processing plant with Bond and a group of Asian investors. Attending the meeting, he notices the undercover spy and covertly holds him at gunpoint during the laboratory demonstrations, pressing a Walther P5 into his spine. His suspicions about Bond's presence are confirmed when Bond sets the lab on fire.
On Sanchez's orders, Dario binds Bond's ankles and wrists with rope and places him on a conveyor belt that drops cocaine bricks into a grinding machine to be mixed with gasoline. After Sanchez leaves, Bond manages to grab hold of the edge, prompting Dario to cut his ropes in order to shove him in. Before he can do so, he is distracted by the sight of Pam Bouvier (whom he believes to be dead) saying ""Ha! You're dead!"", who shoots at him, replying back ""You took the words right out of my mouth."", knocking him off his feet. Her gun jams and as he attempts to get back up laughing, but Bond grabs him by his feet and pulls him into the grinder. Dario manages to grab onto Bond and screams for Sanchez to stop the machine but he is caught by the grinder, which slowly and agonizingly pulls him in, killing him in around ten seconds.
Dario appears in the video game 007 Legends alongside Franz Sanchez. Still portrayed by Benicio del Toro, Dario takes part in the battle in his boss's refinery except that his last appearance is not the same as in the film. Instead of being simply crushed by wanting to detach Bond, he attacks Bond to defend Sanchez who then orders him to kill both Bond and Bouvier. The player must then face Dario until he strikes him over a barrier and falls into the grinder.

720,/wiki/Brazil,"Brazil, or the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in South America by population and area.
Brazil became a weak empire after its independence from Portugal, which soon became an effective republic who helped the Allied nations in World War I and World War II, but fell to a coup d'état in 1964, which caused the formation of a two-party republic under a military regime. The dictatorship collapsed in 1985 and the Federative Republic of Brazil was formed and is currently the government of Brazil.
One of the only two times Bond has been to South America was in Moonraker. Bond goes to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil during the Brazilian military junta and up the Amazon River in a speedboat to Drax's secret facility in the Amazon jungle.
Brazil is famous for its festive culture and its yearly festival ""Carnaval"". Its main language is Portuguese and its capital is Brazilia, while the largest cities are Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

She tells Bond that she is tired of watching Largo show off and letting him use her. She explains to Bond that she is trapped like a bird in a gilded cage.
Domino ultimately escapes as Largo attempts to carry out his plan. During a battle with Bond, while he is focused on 007, she appears behind him and shoots him in the neck with a harpoon from a spear gun, avenging her brother and for what he had previously done to her.

727,/wiki/Honey_Ryder_(Literary),"Honeychile (Honey) Ryder is a love interest of James Bond after he met her on an island in Jamaica while he was on an urgent mission. She first appears in Ian Fleming's James Bond novel Dr. No.
Honeychile Rider was a girl who had lived in a large house in the middle of a sugar cane field in the Beau Desert on the North coast near Morgan's harbour, Jamaica. When she was five, her parents were killed in a fire that burned down their home. After that, she lived in the cellars of the ruin's with her black nanny. Once when the cane was harvested, some of the snakes, scorpions and other animals who had lost their homes, came into the ruins and after a while they became like family to Honey, who fed them and looked after them. They would leave when the cane grew back and return to her when it was harvested again.
When she was 15, her nanny died and she was left to fend for herself. A man named Mander, who owned the cane field came into the ruins drunk one day. Honey tried to stab him, but he was too strong. He punched her, knocking her out and breaking her nose and then raped her. Honey got her revenge by putting a black widow spider in his bed one night when he was sleeping.
Ryder is an independent and very beautiful woman, with the minor imperfection of a broken nose. She became a shell diver near Crab Key in order to make enough money by selling them to American collectors, so that she can then have a nose operation. She made mistakes of the trade at first such as acquiring pretty, but common shells rather than the uglier, but rarer varieties and polishing the shells rather than leaving them be. Honey Ryder also felt one with nature. She told Bond that she had read the encyclopedia from A to the middle of T and she expressed great value for life, animals, and humans.
One day on Crab Key, she emerges from the sea with some very rare shells only to meet the gaze of James Bond. Honey was naked, save for the belt holding her knife, and is startled by him at first, but is quick to warn him not to interfere with the sea shells. Bond takes her with him and the two develop a mutual attraction towards each other. Honey says she would like to be a call girl as she heard the money was good, but Bond quickly told her she would be foolish to pursue such a degrading ""career"".
The pair meet up with Quarrel and are later ambushed by armed patrolmen. She and Bond are later captured by Dr. Julius No. He holds here in his facility with Bond for days. Dr. No later attempts to kill her by tying her to some rocks and allowing crabs to eat her alive. However, she is aware that the crabs do not like human flesh and they won't attack her as long as she is still and unprovocative. She manages to escape, meets up with a badly injured Bond and they leave the island.
It is implied in the book that she and Bond will later take a vacation to New York City, where Bond plans to help her find work in a museum and also plans to get her nose fixed. He also asks for someone on Jamaica to ""keep an eye"" on her.
In later novels, Bond divulges that Honey Ryder moved to Philadelphia, where she worked as an actress. She married a doctor by the name of Wilder and had two children with him.
"
728,/wiki/Braun_(George_Lane_Cooper),"Braun is first seen during James Bond's arrival at Piz Gloria under the alias of Sir Hilary Bray. After rolling out a red carpet, he proceeds to help Fraulein Bunt and ""Bray"" out of the helicopter. Looking at the guard's sidearm, Bond comments ""Fraulein, I should warn you guns make me very nervous."" To which Bunt attempts to reassure the apparently nervous genealogist. During dinner, Braun is seen serving as a waiter.
Later in the film, with fellow guard Felsen, he accompanies Bunt in her pursuit of the escaping Bond through the Swiss village of Lauterbrunnen. Tracking him to a shed filled with bells, both men brawl with the spy, but are overpowered by him. Although knocked out by Bond, the pair are woken up by Bunt in order to continue the pursuit.
Escaping, 007 attempts to mingle in with the crowds near the village Ice Rink. As Braun and Bunt close in on him, he is approached by hir girlfriend, Tracy, who leads him to her car. Realizing that Bond has evaded them, the thugs return to their car and set off in pursuit, almost killing the spy as he attempts to use a phone-box to communicate with London.
In an attempt to evade them, Bond and Tracy veer into the middle of a stock car race. As expected, Bunt and her men follow and carnage ensues. Sitting in the front passenger seat of the car, Braun manages to get a few potshots at Bond's car before his own car is toppled. The vehicle's occupants are forced to abandon the burning car before it explodes. 
Later, someone resembling Braun takes part in the shooting at Piz Gloria where he is shot to death by James Bond after attempting a failed sneak attack, a little time after the death of Grunther. Interestingly, he seems to have blonde hair at the back of his head, which Braun does not have in any other scene, but Bond repeats his ""guns make me nervous"" line, originally directed at Braun, to him after shooting him, making whether this is actually Braun or not unclear.

729,/wiki/Boris_Grishenko_(Alan_Cumming),"Boris Ivanovich Grishenko (In Russian: Борис Иванович Грищенко) was a fictional Russian computer technician at the GoldenEye control center in Severnaya, Siberia. He appeared as henchman to Alec Trevelyan in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye and was portrayed by Scottish actor Alan Cumming. The character also appeared in John Gardner's accompanying novelization and in 1997 video game adaptation.
Boris Grishenko worked at the Severnaya observatory in Siberia which watched over the two weapons satellites, Petya and Mischa. He is first seen helping fellow programmer Natalya Simonova get into a programme by using a perverse female password much to another fellow programmer Anna Nishkov's disgust, especially when she sees a perverted cartoon likeness of herself on the screen. She scoffs at his boorish attitude, remarking ""He wouldn't know woman if one came up and sat on his head,"" much to Natalya's amusement.
Another program Boris made was to triangulate on the origin of an outside program, he hacked into the US Department of Defense. Boris finished it to the FBI by sending a spike, with a message ""Better luck next time, slugheads.""
Later, Boris disappeared when he was ""going for a cigarette"" and was never seen again. He had actually slipped away and flew off with General Arkady Ourumov and Xenia Onatopp, having allied himself with them and Alec Trevelyan, head of Janus to steal the GoldenEye satellite, but not before Xenia massacred multiple Severnaya employees and activated a satellite to fire on Severnaya as ""target practice"" in electromagnetic warfare. This succeeded, as the Severnaya facility was destroyed. A Russian airbase a few hundred kilometers away was alerted that Severnaya was under attack, and deployed three fighter jets to intercept the attackers. The electromagnetic pulse had killed the fighter pilots as well, with one jet crashing into the satellite dish.
Natalya was the sole survivor of the Severnaya massacre, as she had hid herself in a cupboard which had shielded her from the radiation and ensuing debris. Believing Boris to be innocent and of good fortune to have excused himself for a smoke prior to the carnage, she shouted for Boris, believing him to be in the area (unaware he was spirited away by Ourumov).
Ourumov later reports to the Russian Defense Minister Dmitri Mishkin, passing off Grishenko as a lucky survivor. Natalya, still also under the impression that Grishenko was lucky to have survived, attempts to contact him via email. After telling him that Ourumov shot everyone at the bunker, Boris tells her to meet him at a nearby church and to trust no one. At the church, Boris lets Onatopp capture Natalya.
After saving Natalya and killing Ourumov, James Bond does not know how to locate Alec's base. By accessing the computer inside the train Natalya manages to hack inside Boris' network. Although Boris tries to rip out his servers, Natalya finds out that the base is at Cuba.
At the base, Trevelyan tells Boris to heave the base out of the lake. Boris claims that he is not ready but Trevelyan angrily urges him to do it anyway. After the base has emerged, Trevelyan hands Boris the GoldenEye master control key, threateningly telling Boris that it better be working. While Boris makes the final preparations, Trevelyan is handed a tablet by one of his henchman and watches footage of Bond and Natalya sneaking onto the base. He sends his men to deal with Bond and orders Boris to have the GoldenEye satellite target London, as they activate the weapon. Eventually, Bond and Natalya are captured and brought before Alec. Boris is delighted to see Natalya, but she furiously slaps him and continues to attack until she is restrained by guards. He picks up Bond's explosive pen that had fallen to the ground and starts to click it. Natalya tells him of her disgust by his betrayal and that millions of people may die because of his sick games.
He furiously raises a clenched fist to her face, but Trevelyan stops him and sends Boris back to his computer to check whether Natalya has done any harm hacking before she was captured. Big-mouthed, Boris brags that Natalya does not have his skills and would be unable to hack into the GoldenEye. Boris' overconfidence is misplaced, as soon thereafter the alarms are activated, with Boris now stating that GoldenEye is about to re-enter Earth's atmosphere which would cause the satellite to ignite and explode, in twelve minutes' time. Boris tries to hack back into the system, viciously clicking the pen, whilst Bond counts the many times it is clicked, knowing that three clicks arm its grenade, whilst three more disarm it. Bond senses an opportunity and knocks the pen from Boris' hand which falls near the gasoline canister, causing it to blow up. Fuelled by the gasoline and the explosive charge Bond set earlier, the explosion destroys almost the entire control room. However, Boris' computer equipment survives. Alec dispatches a guard to kill Boris if he fails to break Natalya's code or tries to escape, and then sets off to hunt down Bond.
Eventually, Boris manages to access the system and resets the antenna. However, Bond, who has meanwhile reached the antenna, disables the mechanism by jamming a metal bar into the rotation belts, causing grave harm to the system. This eventually results in a giant explosion that destroys the remainder of the base and kills Trevelyan. Miraculously, Boris survives. Emerging from the ruins, he loudly exclaims that he's invincible. But he celebrates too soon as at the same moment, the canisters behind him that contain liquid nitrogen explode, covering and freezing Boris to death.
Boris was a featured character in the 1997 video game Goldeneye 007 for the Nintendo 64. He could be one of the eight main characters played in the multiplayer mode. He was featured in two stages. The first stage was the second mission, or Bond's first trip to Severnaya (a main difference from the film is that Bond never went to Severnaya). In the first stage he is known as ""Programmer"" and ""Boris"" in the second stage. Bond is ordered to capture Boris in Severnaya, then force Boris to disable the security so MI6 can hack the Severnaya database. (Boris dying or fleeing the Severnaya facility before Bond captures him would result in a failed mission.) If Bond succeeds at capturing Boris, he will do as Bond commands, however his tampering with the mainframe will sound the alarm, resulting in Bond having to fight multiple Soviet soldiers, although the mission will be successful.
Boris is mentioned again in the Train level, when Natalya tries to use the computer in Trevelyan's dining car to track him to Cuba. Boris makes his second and final appearance in Trevelyan's base, feigning innocence to Bond before attempting to pull a gun on him. Being utterly incompetent in firearms, Boris fumbles and drops it. He begs for his life, saying Trevelyan made him do it and then runs away shouting his catchphrase when Bond's back is turned. As in Severnaya, killing Boris results in mission failure; Natalya, still unaware of the depth of Boris' treachery, will refuse to help Bond further if he kills him, claiming that Boris was only a pawn of Trevelyan's and did not deserve death. In order for the mission to succeed, Bond must allow Boris to flee.
Though a brilliant computer programmer, Boris was also known to be perverse and perverted mostly by the way he used female body parts as his access codes and passwords and also shown to be full of arrogance and self-confidence especially when he shouted ""I am invincible"" whenever he succeeded in finishing a task.
He later became a backstabbing traitor having sided with Janus to steal a dangerous electronic satellite that was used to murder his fellow programmers at Severnaya to leave no witnesses of the theft.
He was shown to be friends with Natalya who saw him just as an annoying little brother and was a bit more patient with his wayward antics, but then her friendship with him turned to hatred when she realised he was partly responsible for the murder of Anna and all the other people at the Severnaya observatory as well as him being willing to kill more people for personal profit.
Perhaps because of his ego, Boris became somewhat unstable when he was confronted with a problem he couldn't solve.  When Natalya changed the codes to lock him out of the computer, he insisted he could fix it himself; when he failed to do so, he screamed in her face, demanding her codes.  Later, when the satellite, dish failed to respond to his commands (because Bond had sabotaged it), Boris devolved into manhandling the computer screen and screaming incoherently.

Originally, Gayson was going to be cast as Miss Moneypenny, but that part went to Lois Maxwell instead.
She was born in Croydon, South London.
For a number of years she played the part of Frau Schrader (The Baroness) in the London production of The Sound of Music at the Palce Theatre, singing two songs which were cut from the film version.
Gayson was originally to have been a regular in the Bond film series, but her character was dropped. Gayson's voice in Dr. No and From Russia with Love was overdubbed by voice actress Nikki van der Zyl, as were the voices of nearly all the actresses appearing in the first two Bond films, though Gayson's real voice can still be heard in original trailers for Dr. No.
As the first female to be seen in Dr. No together with James Bond (Sean Connery), she is officially the very first actress to play a Bond girl.
Decades later, Gayson's daughter appeared in a casino scene in the 1995 Bond film GoldenEye.

733,/wiki/Charmain_Bond,"Charmian Bond was James Bond's paternal Aunt who lived in a small village called Pett Bottom, Canterbury. She became his legal guardian when he was 11 years old, after the death of his parents.
After teaching James at home since the death of his parents, Charmian sent her nephew James to Eton College one semester into the year when he was 13 years old. While he was at school, she went to Scotland to look after her ill older brother Max Bond. However, as the year went on, Max's condition began to decline, so she sent James a train ticket in the mail alongside a note explaining the situation, and had James come to join them. She met him at the station, and drove to Max's estate in her Bentley 4½ Litre, where she her brother him for attempting to take James's bags in his condition. The boys then entertained themselves, and on the second night, Charmian took James to the circus, where she met her friend Annie Kelley, and her nephew Red Kelley whom James had met on the train. They returned home satisfied, and the next day, she stayed in with Max while James spent the day with Red. When he returned later that night, he asked if the next day he could go camping with the boy, and while Charmian was initially apprehensive, she arranged to prepare them a first aid kit and pack him a lunch for the following day before going to bed.
The next morning around 4 AM, Charmian was awakened by Max shouting in the other room. He called out James' name in his sleep before surrendering to his condition. With little time to mourn, Char was told by Red Kelly that James was danger at Lord Hellebore's castle. When she arrived, she found James unconscious, being watched by Wilder Lawless, while the castle burned behind them. James was deemed too weak to be taken to the hospital at Kilcraymore, and was unconscious in bed for ten days. Char often talked to him while he slept, and while she was out of the room, he awoke. They boy had gotten a bad cut on his cheek, but Char did not expect it would leave any lasting mark. He slowly recovered and one day she found him by the river feeling much better but wondering about Max. Char explained that he had passed, and that his condition was much worse than they had let on. The two attended a memorial service, where Max was mourned by many friends, and James returned to Eton, while Char returned to her home at Pett Bottom.
While James is on long leave from Eaton, he spent his weekend with his aunt at her cottage. The two of them enjoyed a picnic lunch. There, James told Charmian that he was interested in joining his teacher Peter Haight's expedition to Sardinia. Charmian noted that James could spend the beginning of the holidays with her before she departed for Brazil. She further suggested that James join his cousin Victor Delacroix in Capo D'orso at some point during the expedition and that Charmian would write to him to inform him of James' intentions. James then asked Charmian about certain tattoos which gave Charmian an opportunity to elaborate upon the history of tattoos in relation to widespread gang use. Later, as James was leaving her cottage, Charmian stuffed a letter from James' teacher Merriotte into his pocket.

734,/wiki/GoldenEye:_Rogue_Agent,"GoldenEye: Rogue Agent is a first-person shooter video game published by Electronic Arts. The player takes the role of an ex-MI6 agent, who is recruited by Auric Goldfinger (a member of a powerful unnamed criminal organisation based on SPECTRE) to assassinate his rival, Dr. No. Several other characters from the James Bond series make appearances throughout the game, including Pussy Galore, Oddjob, Xenia Onatopp, and Francisco Scaramanga.
Despite its name and being part of the James Bond universe, the game has no relation to the 1995 film or the 1997 video game of the same name. In this setting the game's protagonist is given the name 'GoldenEye' after he loses his eye and receives a gold-colored cybernetic replacement. Electronic Arts has listed this particular title along with 007 Racing (2000) as spin-offs that do not make part of the canon they have built with Tomorrow Never Dies (1999).
At the start of Rogue Agent, a recording by M (head of MI6) reveals that: ""Three years ago, while on assignment, the agent was severely wounded in an encounter with Dr. No, and subsequently lost the use of his right eye. Consumed with vengeance, he frequently resorts to violence and brutality, and is no longer fit for service with MI6."" According to the account, the agent was shot in his right eye by Dr. No during a mission.
Three years after the incident which claimed the agent's right eye, he is evaluated through a holographic simulation in which he is paired with 007 to stop Auric Goldfinger, a member of a criminal organization, from detonating a suitcase nuke inside Fort Knox. He fails the test, and is held directly responsible for the ""death"" of 007. Charged with ""reckless brutality"", he is dismissed from MI6. As he leaves the headquarters, he is seen reading an offer by Goldfinger to enlist in his organization.
The game featured a highly customizable multiplayer component with a four-player split screen play, as well as online play on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions. On November 26, 2006, the servers for both versions were shut down due to ""inactivity"" online. Players can unlock additional customization options, skins, maps, and gametype variations by playing through Story Mode and performing well. There are some locked skins such as Oddjob, Dr. No, and Xenia Onatopp. There are also locked maps such as the Pump Room, Carver's Press, the BathHouse, the Vault Core, the Lower Turbine, Dr. No's reactor, the Fissure Platform, and GoldenEye's Retreat.
A sequel was originally planned but scrapped due to poor sales and reviews. The game's ending heavily suggested a sequel as well. According to various sources, the sequel would have included vehicles and a longer story mode. On the EA website for GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, a form with many questions about what fans wanted to see in the next game was available. Rogue Agent's engine for the DS was used as a concept for a version of Halo: Combat Evolved for Nintendo's handheld (informally called Halo DS), but didn't get past verification, despite a playable demo being made.

Rogue Agent was largely considered to be an attempt to recreate the success of one of the best-selling video games in recent history, GoldenEye 007, which was a first-person shooter for the Nintendo 64 based on the Bond film GoldenEye. Aside from the character Xenia Onatopp, the Uplink multiplayer level, and the fact that both involve a good agent going bad (although in the case of the original, not the protagonist), GoldenEye: Rogue Agent actually has nothing to do with either the film GoldenEye or its video game adaptation, although the protagonist's scarred appearance considerably resembles Sean Bean's portrayal of rogue agent, Alec Trevelyan, in that film.
Rogue Agent was preceded by the critically acclaimed Bond game Everything or Nothing which featured the likeness and voice talents of Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe and Judi Dench, along with other Bond actors. Rogue Agent, however, was released to mediocre reviews. Reviewers criticized its lack of innovation and personality despite its unique premise, as well as its mediocre gameplay. Several reviewers also disliked its departure from James Bond canon in its introduction and killing off of characters.
The game was however noted for showcasing certain levels and multiplayer maps based on locations from the Bond movies, such as Fort Knox from Goldfinger, the space shuttle base from Moonraker, and Scaramanga's hideout from The Man with the Golden Gun.

Greene Planet was founded by the eponymous businessman, Dominic Greene, to buy up large sums of land for ecological preservation, but in truth, it was nothing more than a front for criminal organization Quantum to control various commodities such as oil and water. As it turns out, Greene has formulated a plot in helping the exiled Bolivian general Luiz Medrano in overthrowing the Bolivian government by offering him funds and weaponry for the coup, and in return, Medrano would hand over a portion of the land to Greene Planet to utilize its vast resources. To that end, Greene bribes CIA section chef for South America, Gregg Beam, with a supply of oil to ignore Quantum's affairs with Bolivia and Colonel Carlos into murdering French agent René Mathis and framing James Bond to cover their tracks.
During Greene and Medrano's meeting at the Eco Hotel, Medrano signs up all the paperwork befor being presented with a new contract: he will allow Quantum to use Bolivia's sole water utility company to sell at higher rates. At first, Medrano refuses to sign this new contract, but Greene silently threatens to have him replaced if he doesn't comply, daring Medrano to shoot him if he wishes to. Medrano reluctantly signed the contract and received his share of the money as promised.

739,/wiki/FN_P90,"The P90 made it's debut in the Bond series beginning with the 1997 video game GoldenEye 007; the weapon then made it's first film appearance in The World Is Not Enough (1999), prominently used by the film's villain, Renard and his henchmen. Renamed for copyright reasons, the FN P90  has been subsequently featured as a weapon in numerous James Bond video games as the ""RC-P90"", ""MB PDW 90"", ""Bequique PS100"", ""PS100"", ""Munitions Belga PDW90"", ""HS-90"" and the ""Vargen"".
The FN P90 appears in the game as the ""MB PDW 90"" in the Nintendo 64 version and as the ""Bequique PS100"" in the PlayStation version. In an unusual variation on a common mistake video games make with reloading the P90, the MB PDW 90 has Bond flip up the section of the receiver behind the magazine well in order to remove and replace the magazine.
The FN P90 appears in the PC version of the game as the ""Munitions Belga PDW90"". It features a green finish on the stock and frame.
The FN P90 appears as the ""Vargen"". It bears the real weapon's 50 bullet clip, though this can be expanded to 63 bullets with the gadget ""high cap magazine"". It is a mid-level SMG with a fast rate of fire and medium power. However, it is lacking in accuracy. The Vargen also has a long reload time. It appears in the single player, sometimes bearing a reflex sight, laser sight, or silencer. These same attachments can be equipped to it in the online mode, with the addition of n ACOG scope as well. The Vargen is unlocked at rank 30 in the online mode of GoldenEye 007: Reloaded, and at rank 29 of GoldenEye 007 (2010).

743,/wiki/Grapnel_Pistol,"The grappling pistol is a fictional grappling device developed by the British Secret Intelligence Service's (SIS/MI6) research and development division, Q-Branch. Such a device first appeared in EON Productions' 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger, with variants featured in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever and 1995's GoldenEye (equipped with a miniature laser cutter).
Similar devices became especially popular in Electronic Arts' James Bond video games as a means of traversing various levels of terrain; beginning with 2001's Agent Under Fire.
While infiltrating the Arkangel Chemical Weapons Facility by bungee jumping from the top of the facility's dam, James Bond utilizes a grappling pistol to grapple onto a section at the base of the dam and pull him towards an entrance point. He then used the pistol's built-in laser to cut open a panel preventing access to the chemical warfare facility's ventilation system.
Appearing in the 2004 video-game Everything or Nothing, named the Rappel Gun, the device is a grappling-hook pistol developed by Q-Branch. It fires a grappling hook to a secure holding point at the top of an accessible ledge, allowing its user to fasten a cable to their belt and climb or descend with ease.

745,/wiki/Colonel_Moon,"Founder and owner of the Graves CorporationColonel Tan-Sun Moon, later known as Sir Gustav Graves, was a fictional North Korean military colonel who attempted to unite the Korean peninsula under his county's flag. After his presumed death at the hands of James Bond, he changed his appearance to infiltrate the society he intended to destroy; becoming a charismatic diamond magnate.
Portrayed jointly by Korean-American actor, Will Yun Lee, (as Moon) and British actor, Toby Stephens, (as Graves) the character served as the main antagonist of the 2002 James Bond film, Die Another Day. He was also featured in Raymond Benson's accompanying novelisation and was re-imagined for Activision's 2012 James Bond video game, 007 Legends.
Born the son General Moon, Tan-Sun Moon was a Colonel (Sangchwa) in the North Korean People's Army. In a hope that a Western education would help bridge the gap between East and West, General Moon sent his son to study at Oxford and Harvard. It was an experience which would prove formative on the young Moon, providing him with the contacts which he would later use; including Miranda Frost who was on also on the Harvard fencing team. He was able to bring Frost to his side by arranging her to win the Olympic Gold Medal in fencing by implicating her competitor for using steroids. General Moon would later regret the decision, coming to believe that his son had become corrupted by the ideas and greed of the West.
A radical and a dealer in hi-tech weaponry, Moon conducted various illicit operations in diamond  smuggling to fund his private army and ambitions to forcibly unite the two Koreas. He had his base set up in the middle of the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. He also had assistance from a fellow Korean officer named Tang Lin Zao. MI6 becomes aware of his activities, however, and dispatches three agents, including James Bond, to assassinate Moon by intercepting and replacing a diamond smuggler named Van Bierk.
When Zao finds out that Bond is in truth a British spy sent to kill him, Moon uses to destroy the helicopter Bond arrived in with one of his high-tech weapons, called Tankbuster, killing the two remaining agents. Before he can kill Bond too, Moon is told that General Moon is about to arrive at the base. The Colonel and his men then quickly leave the base with the hovercrafts and weapons, so that his father doesn't find out about his weapon dealing. He leaves Bond to be shot by his men but the agent escapes by blowing up the diamond suitcase, having implanted a bomb earlier, and fleeing with the last remaining hovercraft. Pursuing Moon, Bond has to fight off many Korean soldiers while being shot at by Moon with his Tankbuster and a flamethrower.
Eventually jumping onto Moon's hovercraft, Bond attacks the young military and the two fight long enough for the hovercraft to reach a cliff. Without a pilot to steer it the hovercraft drives right over the cliff into the river far below. Bond is able to jump off in time, but Moon is dragged over the cliff and presumed deceased. Right after, Bond is arrested by General Moon and his soldiers, and brought to a North Korean torture camp where he is brutally interrogated for before being exchanged for Zao, who had been arrested by the British.
Unknown to the rest of the world - including his own father - Moon survives the incident and flees to Cuba, where he undergoes DNA replacement therapy (provided by Dr. Alvarez) to alter his appearance to make him appear to be of European descent. Emerging from the therapy, he completed his transformation and adopted the name Gustav Graves.
Gustav Graves was seen as a sophisticated, sarcastic, rude and arrogant business man. In a conversation with Bond later in the film, he admits that he modelled this new identity after him. He portrays himself to the world as an ecologist, fencing champion and adrenaline junkie, with a penchant for speed—activities which he has plenty of time for, given that the gene therapy has robbed him of the ability to sleep.
His official story was that he was an orphan who worked in diamond mines in Argentina; from there, he learned engineering and founded the Graves Corporation. He discovered a great mine of diamonds in Iceland and made a huge fortune. With that fortune, Graves developed Icarus - a satellite which harnesses solar energy and focuses it, ""gently"", over the Earth, supposedly putting an end to famine and poverty. In reality, his fortune was made using a fake diamond mine as a front for laundering African conflict diamonds and his Icarus satellite is a super-weapon. The main purpose of Icarus was to blast its way through the heavily-fortified demilitarized zone, providing a pathway for the invading North Korean forces and bringing about Korean unification.
Brought on Graves' trace through blood diamonds he found with Zao, Bond - unaware of Graves' true identity - travels to London, where he witnesses Graves arriving at the Buckingham Palace by parachute before he is knighted by the Queen. Later that day, Bond visits the fencing academy where Graves is training and manages to persuade the fight trainer Verity to arrange a match with Graves. When being introduced to Graves, the villain asks whether they have met before, to which Bond responds by stating he would remember. Graves admits that he is mistaking. Driven by their arrogance, both men then engage in their training match, betting money on the outcome. When Graves asks Bond if he still wants to continue, Bond proposes to up the wager, showing him one of the blood diamonds he got from Zao.
When continuing their fight, Bond cuts Graves at the hand, pausing their fight to continue. When Bond mockingly-affably asks Graves whether he wants to continue, Graves responds that of course he wants to ""bloody continue"", but proposes that they use real swords and fight till first blood drawn from the torso. They engage in a furious duel, where both men are cut multiple times. Fighting their way through the club, changing their weapons multiple times. Eventually hammering at each others with medieval claymores, they continue their fight in the outer parts of the club, with Bond finally cutting Graves at the stomach, thereby throwing him into a fountain. Graves emerges furiously but before he can continue the fight, Miranda Frost stops them. Graves laughs and admits that Bond beat him and the men shake hands. Before they leave, Graves, as a token of good sportsmanship, invites Bond to his Icarus demonstration in Iceland at the next weekend.
When Bond arrives at Graves' Ice Palace at Iceland, a palace made from pure ice only built for the demonstration of Icarus, he is greeted by Graves and his security head Mr. Kil. While the guests entertain themselves inside, Graves is using his dream machine. He is interrupted by a man who is revealed to be Zao. Seeing his old friend for the first time after Zao's departure, Graves looks at his unfinished face and asks him who did that. Zao responds that it is Bond's work and Graves gleefully tells him that he has met Bond and Bond did not recognize him at all. Graves then asks Zao of news of his father and Zao tells him that General Moon still mourns his death.
The guests are then called for the presentation. Graves then presents Icarus, telling them that it will be used to bring light to the darkest places on earth and is able to warm even the coldest places to grow crops, therefor being a mean to end world hunger. He then uses Icarus to illuminate the entire palace, causing giant applause from the guests.
When NSA agent Jinx, who has also reached Island, breaks into the complex where Graves' chambers are located to kill Graves, she expects to find him under the dream machine's mask. However, when she takes the mask off, Zao looks at her and Graves attacks her from behind, wearing the prototype of his Icarus suit.
After saving Jinx from Zao, Bond heads to Graves' office where he waits for his old enemy. When Graves arrives, Bond tells him that he knows his true identity, based on Zao's presence and the lack of alternative explanations for the dream machine's presence. Graves mocks him, telling him he thought that Bond would never get it. He then reveals to Bond that while they only met briefly, Bond had made a lasting impression on him, causing him to model his new identity Gustav Graves after the MI6 agent. Miranda then arrives, holding her weapon at Graves. Graves remarks seemingly defeated that Miranda seems to be not the one she claims to be. Bond agrees, but then Graves asks whether he has found out who betrayed him in North Korea and if it never occurred to him to look inside MI6. Miranda then aims her gun at Bond, revealing herself as the traitor. Graves also reveals that he knows of Jinx and says that a tragedy will befall her soon.
When Bond is about to be killed, Bond goads Zao into hitting him into stomach in order to allow him to fall to the ground. Using a special ring he got from MI6's quartermaster, he breaks the glass panel that covers the entire floor in order to fall into the lower floor. As Bond runs off, Graves orders Zao to follow and kill him but Bond escapes with Graves' speeder, driving off into the ice plains at insane speed. When Zao returns and tells Graves that Bond escaped, Graves decides to unleash Icarus.
He orders Zao to bring the three North Korean generals (Dong, Li & Han) that were underneath the guests and tells them that he will demonstrate them the full power of Icarus. He then has Icarus produce a gargantuan heat beam, which Bond can only escape because of his vehicle's enormous speed. When Bond drives off a cliff, hanging there only on the breaking hook of the speeder, Graves has Icarus cut off the entire cliff. Though Bond survives, Graves believes him to be dead.
Preparing to return to North Korea, Graves leaves Zao at the palace to oversee the final preparations. He, Miranda and most of his men then leave the palace, leaving Zao only with a minimal force. Returning to the palace for Jinx, Bond sees their escape plane arrive. On the plane, Graves uses Icarus to destroy his ice palace, destroying any evidence left. After this, he tells his engineer Vlad to complete the Icarus suit.
Having fled to a North Korean airbase, Graves plans to use Icarus to destroy the minefield in the demilitarized zone, allowing North Korean forces to attack the South. As General Moon wouldn't allow this war, the hardliners staged a coup and put the general under arrest. Bond and Jinx are sent to stop Graves.When the USA sends a missile to destroy Icarus, Graves uses the satellite's power to disintegrate it mid-air.
Unable to assassinate Graves at the airbase, Jinx and Bond are forced to board Graves' plane. On-board the plane, Graves and the generals are inside a planning room, where Graves admires the finished Icarus suit. He tells his men to have his father brought down. When General Moon arrives, Graves addresses him, but as his face is changed General Moon does not recognize him. When Moon tells him that he does not now him, Graves says that Moon always found it difficult to accept him, which made his exile easier to bear. He then quotes his father, which makes Moon realises that the man next to him is his son. However, he is deeply shocked, asking what his son did to himself. Graves then tells his father to watch the rising of his son and activates Icarus to destroy the minefield. However, opposed to Graves, Moon is disgusted by the heat beam as he knows this would mean war, with the Americans presumably sending nuclear warheads.
Finally realizing what his son has become, Moon grabs a gun from General Han and points it at his son's head. Graves asks his father whether he would kill his own son. When Moon claims that his son died long ago, Graves disarms him with the electricity glove of his Icarus suit and shoots him. He then sees Bond walking towards him and about to shoot him, but a henchman intervenes and the bullet hits the plane's window instead, causing it to break, sucking out everyone except Bond and Graves.
Graves and Bond then fight in the remains of the room, with Graves eventually overpowers Bond with his shock glove, Graves takes the plane's two parachutes and throws one out of the window. Intending to leave Bond to die in the plane crash, Graves kneels down next to Bond for one last gloat.
As he leans over the fallen spy to gloat, 007 reaches out and yanks the parachute's release cord; causing Graves to be pulled through a hole in the fuselage. As Moon desperately clings onto the edge of the chassis, Bond reaches out and activates the suit's electric defenses causing Moon to shock himself. He loses his grip and is sucked - along with the controls for the Icarus - into the Autonov's jet engine. With the destruction of his suit, Icarus is rendered harmless.
Gustav Graves also appears in 007 Legends in the Die Another Day mission. He has the likeness of is and voiced by Toby Stephens, but no reference is made to his past as Colonel Moon, implying that he was born Gustav Graves. The only exception to this theory is that a bust of Colonel Moon's head can be seen on Graves's cargo plane. Although he is shown wearing his North Korean uniform underneath his armor, his collar cuffs are absent.
While an original character, the character of Gustav Graves incorporates a number of elements from Ian Fleming's original novel Moonraker. In that novel, a Nazi adopts a new identity and becomes a popular British multi-millionaire. He then donates millions to create a ""Moonraker"" missile which is supposed to be for Britain's protection but is actually meant to destroy London. In addition, the club called Blades, a fencing club in this film, was featured as a gentleman's club in Moonraker. The name Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is a homage to the first official James Bond novel written after Ian Fleming's death, Colonel Sun by Robert Markham (Kingsley Amis).

746,/wiki/BMW_Z3,"The BMW Z3 was the first modern mass-market roadster produced by BMW, as well as the first new BMW model assembled in the United States. The Z in Z3 originally stood for Zukunft (German for future). (The very first BMW assembled in the US was the E36/5, 318i that rolled off the Spartanburg Plant assembly line beginning in October 1994.) The Z3 was introduced as a 1996 model year vehicle, shortly after being featured in EON Productions' 1995 James Bond film, GoldenEye.
The first Z3's were equipped with a 16 valve 1.9 units developing 140 hp, later replaced by a 8 valve version of the same engine that had power output of about 115 hp. Weighing 1150 kg this nimble machine could easily accelerate to 100 km/h in less than 8,5 seconds.
There were a few variants of the car before its production run ended in 2002, including a coupé version for 1999. It was manufactured and assembled in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The Z3 was replaced by the BMW Z4 introduced in late 2002 at the Paris Auto Show. The BMW Z Series are a line of roadsters considered to be successor to the BMW 507
the Z3 was the start of BMW's three film plan deal between BMW and The Bond franchise,  the deal started with GoldenEye (film) and it concluded with The World Is Not Enough (film) it was introduced as a 1996 model year vehicle. At that time Karen Sortito created the BMW campaign for the film GoldenEye. Afterwards, while the film was number one at the box office, sales of the car spiked. The entire 1996 BMW Z3 roadster production run, more than 15,000 roadsters, was sold out by the time the car was introduced.
Appearing in 1995's GoldenEye, the BMW Z3 was a controversial choice for some Bond purists, it being the first non-British production car to feature in a Bond movie as the spy's primary mode of transport. A convertible, it comes fully equipped with ""all the usual refinements"" including a self-destruct system and stinger missiles located behind the headlights. The car in the film is only driven briefly in Cuba, and Bond ends up trading it for Jack Wade's plane. As a result, it has the dubious honor of being one of the few cars Bond gets from Q-Branch which is not destroyed in the field. This wasn't very well received by purists and people of the car world, complaining that the Z3 should have got more screentime after boasting about the weapons  and that all the publicity of the car was for nothing, however this was fixed in 1997 with the BMW 750iL of  1997's Tomorrow Never Dies (film)

Ernesto Montes was a very powerful, and according to his daughter, cruel military officer. He worked for the Bolivian military junta during the violent military coups of the early 1980s. He had a beautiful Russian wife and two daughters, the younger of whom was Camille Montes. One day the opposition sent General Medrano to Ernesto's house: he shot him, raped his wife and eldest daughter and strangled them while the young Camille watched. Concluding that the child was not a threat, Medrano simply smiled at her and set the house on fire. Though physically and psychologically scarred by the event, Camille survived and planned to avenge her family.

750,/wiki/Heads_You_Die,"Heads You Die is the seventh book in the Young Bond series of spin-off James Bond novels and the second to be written by English novelist, Steve Cole. It was first published on 5th May 2016 by Red Fox, an imprint of Random House.
The story begins in a Scolopendra Industries laboratory as an arms dealer named Sarila Karatan steals a valuable strongbox and makes her escape by boat. Before she can get away she is mowed down by fire from an aircraft. Some time later, James Bond is chasing a pickpocket through the streets of Havana to recover a wallet belonging to family friend and research chemist, Gerald Hardiman. After their adventures in Los Angeles, he and Hugo are staying with the nervous chemist in Cuba. The reason for his unease is revealed after Bond prevents the abduction of a girl named Maritsa by two thugs - Ramón Mosqueda and El Puño. Hardiman had been attempting to smuggle her friend, Jagua Solares, the abused daughter of ruthless industrialist Scolopendra, out of the country. He is subsequently kidnapped and Bond, Hugo, Jagua and Maritsa search the city for him. While investigating Scolopendra's penthouse James encounters La Velada - a mysterious veiled woman whom Jagua believes is manipulating her father. He eavesdrops on her telephone conversation and discovers that Hardiman is still alive. She sees his reflection in the glass of a display case and opens fire on him.
James escapes the building on a motorbike procured by Jagua and the pair retrieve her old diving gear from a warehouse. The group head to the coastline where Sarila's boat sank and practice diving with the rudimentary equipment. The next day James and Hugo follow a lead to Ramón's suite at the Gran Casino. Instead of finding Hardiman they witness Scolopendra and La Velada interrogating his former chief enforcer, Chester MacLean. Believing him to be responsible for helping Sarila, Scolopendra flips his lucky coin to determine the man's fate - heads, he dies. The pair fight their way from the building, steal a car and return to the girls at Playa Caimito. James and Jagua dive toward the wreck and discover the strongbox. They are set upon by American divers and are forced to surface; discovering that Hugo and Maritsa are missing. Pursued by a boat they make for the shore and jump one of the divers as he emerges from the ocean. They take the box from him and escape by motorbike - only to end up dropping their treasure during a chase with the police. Bond watched from a distance as the officers opened the sealed box, revealing wads of hundred dollar bills inside.
He meets Jagua (and unexpectedly Hugo) at her home village of Sabana de Robles and together they realize that La Velada is a member of the Soviet intelligence apparat, the NKVD. Scolopendra, La Velada and El Puño arrive with the traitorous Maritsa and they take Jagua away. James and Hugo emerge from their hiding places and attempt to intercept them at the sea port of Batabano. They split up to evade the police, but Bond is arrested and taken to the local police station. There he sees La Velada recover the strongbox and discovers that the police officers are afflicted by some kind of horrific condition brought about by the money. He escapes in the chaos and encounters El Puño in the process of torching the evidence and kidnapping the incarcerated American diver, Franklin Ford. He narrowly escapes the building and meets up with Hugo at the harbour; where they are captured by Ramón and La Velada. They are taken to Scolopendra's shipyard, where they see a huge log raft under construction, and are flown to his estate. The pair are brought into his laboratory and are subjected to a botfly attack to extract a confession from Hardiman. It is revealed that the chemist has been supplying information to the U.S. foreign intelligence agency, the CIP. They had been investigating Scolopendra's operations since his poison trials murdered the sister of one of their operatives, Valentine Barbey. Sarila and the divers had all been CIP operatives.
Inside their cell Bond and Hugo notice a journal belonging to Barbey's sister, Lana, unwittingly detailing how Scolopendra's research staff were used as guinea pigs. Later that evening the boys, Hardiman and Jagua dine with Scolopendra and La Velada. They outline their scheme to introduce poisoned money into the economy of Great Britain - forcing them to become a vassal of the Soviet Union in exchange for a cure. As incentive for Hardiman to work quickly on the antidote they reveal that Bond and Hugo have been poisoned by Lana's journal. They are subsequently rescued from their cell by Jagua and make their way toward the laboratory building for the antidote. However, the building explodes - demolished to destroy all evidence of its manufacture. They are cornered by El Puño and La Velada. La Velada confesses that she has indeed been manipulating her father and plans to kill him once they reach England. She also reveals that, like Bond and Hugo, Maritsa had been poisoned by her brief contact with her bribe money and only has a week to live. As she aims to shoot Jagua the boys block her line-of-fire. El Puño goes to move them, but accidentally blocks her view and provides them with a chance to escape. They are separated in the chaos and James makes for the paper mill; discovering that it has also been scheduled for demolition and is full of high explosives. Following him, El Puño is knocked backward into one of the chemical vats and is decapitated.
The teenagers reunite and, realizing that it is being used to transport the poisoned currency to England, fly to the log raft in Scolopendra's seaplane. Their fuel tank is hit by weapons-fire from the flotilla and they land alongside. As James sneaks onboard the tugboat pulling the raft, Jagua persuades her father (with the secret help of Hugo) that the CIP are coming and La Velada, who tried to kill her, cannot be trusted. Scolopendra turns on Ramón, believing he has been divulging information to the CIP, grabbing him and accidentally igniting the leaking aviation fuel with a burst a machine-gun fire. The logs and the money catch fire and, as the inferno spreads, the tortured CIP diver escapes and opens fire on Scolopendra's men. In the chaos Hardiman leaps overboard with the antidotes and La Valeda makes her escape in the motor-yacht. Bond is confronted by Scolopendra in the listing tugboat's engine room, swatting aside Hugo and attempting to kill James with a makeshift club. Jagua appears in the doorway and distracts her father by threatening to poison herself; as they embrace, she sinks a knife into her father's back. He slaps her to the ground and as he prepares to deliver the coup de grâce with his club, James fires the ship's Lyle gun - it recoils and trips the villain, sending him plummeting into the hold, dead. The ship lurched, taking on water, and Hugo also falls into the hold. Bond narrowly saves the tangled boy from drowning by cutting him loose with the knife in Scolopendra's back. Jagua resuscitates him with CPR. The tugboat sinks and the teenagers are rescued by Ford and Hardiman. They travel to Scolopendra's estate and are given the antidote. The book ends as Jagua ponder her future - planning on making it worth something by helping the villagers of Sabana de Robles. Pondering his own destiny, James looks at the stars and asks himself, ""Win or lose, life had to mean something. But what?""

751,/wiki/Canine_Caper,"Canine Caper was the forty-ninth episode of the 1991 animated television series, James Bond Jr, produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation. Written by Francis Moss and Ted Pedersen, the episode first aired on US television on 21st November 1991. The story was subsequently adapted into Caryn Jenner's 1993 children's book, Tunnel of Doom.
The episode begins with defence expert, Bernard Chaplan, being chased by the criminal organisation, S.C.U.M., whilst walking his dog. Before they can abduct him he fastens microfilm to the animal's collar and sends him away. The dog subsequently follows a reluctant James Bond Jr. back to Warfield Academy; where his friends quickly take a liking to the animal. Their attempts to hide the dog, who they have named ""Charlie"", fail and Bond incurs the wrath of Principal Milbanks. With the help of Buddy Mitchell, the students discover the microfilm and determine it to be security plans for Scotland Yard. They decide to return to the point of his abduction and use Charlie (who has been outfitted with a tracking device by I.Q.) to search for him.
There is a seemingly false alarm, as the dog enthusiastically runs up to a blonde lady named Heather; who mysteriously pulls out a two-way radio after the students leave. Shortly afterwards, Charlie follows a scent to a van driven by Skullcap and is abducted. Bond, Gordo and I.Q. jump into his sports-car and use the tracking device to follow the van to London. Realising that the microfilm is missing, mad scientist, Dr. Derange, orders his henchmen to release Charlie - hoping to lure Bond and the film back to his lair in the London Underground. His intuition proves correct and the students fall for the trap. Derange intends to use the plans to break into Scotland Yard and destroy it using an acid bomb. They are taken captive and held in a locked railway carriage alongside Chaplan.
Locked inside the carriage, Bond uses a holographic projection to distract the guards and pulls a brake lever outside with his electromagnetic belt-buckle. The carriage slides backward along the track and crashes through a wall; freeing the prisoners. At the same time, Heather - Chaplan's daughter and an undercover police officer - arrives with police reinforcements. His plans foiled, Derange attempts to exact vengeance upon Bond by trying to melt the students with a large beaker of acid; but is prevented by Charlie, who makes him drop the container. Derange flees and it is revealed that the dog's real name is ""Regis"". Back at Warfield, Bond admits that the animal has grown on him.

752,/wiki/Bond_Girl,"
A Bond Girl is a character who portrays a significant supporting role or a love interest in a James Bond film, novel or video game. They typically have names that are double entendres, such as ""Pussy Galore"" or ""Plenty O'Toole.""
Bond girls might be victims rescued by Bond, fellow agents or allies, villainesses or members of an enemy organization. Other female characters such as Judi Dench's M, Rosa Klebb, Irma Bunt and Miss Moneypenny are not classified as Bond girls.
The role of a Bond girl is typically a high-profile part that can give a major boost to the career of unestablished actresses, although there have been a number of Bond girls that were well-established prior to gaining their role. For instance, Diana Rigg and Honor Blackman were both Bond girls after becoming major stars for their roles on the television series, The Avengers. Additionally, Halle Berry won an Academy Award in 2002, an award presented to her while in the midst of filming Die Another Day.
Ursula Andress is often considered the first Bond girl, playing Honey Ryder in the film Dr. No (1962). She was, however, preceded by Eunice Gayson who played the character Sylvia Trench. Trench is the only Bond girl to appear as the same character in more than one film, appearing again in From Russia with Love (1963). Initially, Trench was planned to be a regular girlfriend of Bond's in the series, but was subsequently dropped after the encore appearance.
It should be noted that Valerie Mathis was the first ever Bond girl on screen in the 1954 version of Casino Royale. She was played by Linda Christian.
To date, only two Bond girls has captured the heart of James Bond. Tracy di Vicenzo played by Diana Rigg, marries Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). At film's end, Tracy Bond is gunned down by 007's nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld. It was initially planned that her death would actually occur in Diamonds Are Forever (1971), but this idea was dropped during filming of On Her Majesty's Secret Service when current-Bond George Lazenby announced he would step down from the role. The other girl is Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale (2006) who was secretly working for Bond's enemies and shared the same fate.
Within the official series, Maud Adams is the only actress to portray a main character as two different Bond girls in two different films, starting as Andrea Anders in The Man with the Golden Gun in 1974 and again as the title character in Octopussy (1983). She additionally appears as an extra in a third Bond film, A View to a Kill in 1985. Two other girls, Martine Beswick (Thunderball) and Nadja Regin (Goldfinger) also appear in a second adventure, appearing first in From Russia with Love. Tsai Chin appeared in two Bond films as well You Only Live Twice (1967) as a Ling and later as Madam Wu in Casino Royale (2006).
In 1995 Famke Janssen, who portrayed Xenia Onatopp, was considered the only major female character (and villain) whom Bond does not bed. However in 2008, lead Bond Girl Camille Montes also shows a restraint to Bond's usually forward charms.
Becoming more frequent, traditional Bond girls that have romantic trysts with Bond, are later discovered to be villainesses starting with Sophie Marceau's Elektra King in The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Miranda Frost portrayed by Rosamund Pike in Die Another Day (2002).
In late 2014, it was announced that Monica Bellucci will play Lucia Sciarra in Spectre (2015). At age 50, Bellucci made record as the oldest Bond girl in the film series. Previously, Honor Blackman held record, playing Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, aged 39 in 1964. Both actresses play the unlikely role, of being a Bond girl older than James Bond.

In addition to those actresses mentioned above, the Bond films traditionally have groups of women in the background whose general purpose is nothing more than eye candy: they include the sunbathing Miami beauties and Pussy Galore's Flying Circus in Goldfinger, the Thai girls at the kung fu school in The Man With the Golden Gun, Tiger Tananka's bathing beauties in You Only Live Twice, and Sheik Hossein's harem in The Spy Who Loved Me. However, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, A View to a Kill, and The Living Daylights these women were also referred to in the media as full fledge Bond girls to provide added publicity for the film through eye-catching magazine and newspaper appearances.
In On Her Majesty's Secret Service, they include Blofeld's Angels of Death. In Moonraker (1979) this included members of Hugo Drax's ""master race"" and a group of women encountered by Bond in the jungles of Brazil, in For Your Eyes Only (1981) many women were seen frolicking around a villain's pool, while in Octopussy (1983) they served mainly as the title character's servants and guards. In A View to a Kill (1985) they adorned Max Zorin's outdoor reception and in The Living Daylights (1987) they served as decorations at the villain's swimming pool and later Bond overpasses a harem in Tangiers. Although the Bond films haven't stopped making use of feminine ""eye candy"" completely, such large ""Bond girl groups"" have not featured again since The Living Daylights.
Mary Goodnight was a supporting character in several Bond novels before graduating to full Bond girl in The Man with the Golden Gun. The short stories ""Quantum of Solace"", ""The Living Daylights"" and ""The Property of a Lady"" feature female characters in prominent roles, but none of these women interact with Bond in any sort of romantic fashion.

753,/wiki/Briefcase_turret,"A briefcase turret is a portable sentry gun concealed in a briefcase. Once set-up, the turret automatically aims and fires at targets that are detected by its sensors. Several briefcase sentries were featured in the James Bond video game series, starting with 2002's Nightfire and later with 2005's From Russia with Love.
The first appearance of a briefcase turret was in the 2002 video game Nightfire. Manufactured by Phoenix International as the ""Ronin"", the briefcase hides a minigun which opens fire on anyone other than the individual who set it up. The weapon is sometimes used by enemy NPCs during single-player missions to guard hallways or rooms. It is available to the player during multiplayer, and although it isn't mobile, the Ronin can be controlled remotely by the player that set it up.
Electronic Arts' 2005 adaption of the classic 1963 film From Russia with Love featured deployable briefcase turrets provided by Q Branch. With its red interior, the weapon resembles the attaché case from the novel and film. Unlike its Nightfire equivalent, the turrets are only available to James Bond and are not remotely controllable.

It is currently owned and managed by the family of Albert R. Broccoli, the co-initiator of the popular film franchise. EON Productions, the production company responsible for producing the James Bond films, is a subsidiary company of Danjaq.
Although the trademarks for material related to the Bond films are held by Danjaq, the copyrights to the first 20 film properties are co-owned by Danjaq LLC and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios (the technical successor to subsidiary United Artists).  The  copyrights to Casino Royale, Quantum Of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre, are shared between Danjaq LLC, MGM, and  Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. Two Bond films have been made outside the control of Danjaq, the first was the 1967 film Casino Royale, with David Niven as Bond; the second was the 1983 film Never Say Never Again, a remake of Thunderball. Never Say Never Again was the result of a legal dispute involving Kevin McClory, one of the credited co-writers of the story used for the novel Thunderball, who was awarded the film rights to the novel in a 1963 settlement with Ian Fleming.

It was loosely affiliated with the Security Service (also known as MI5); however, unlike MI5, Division Three had more than broad investigation and surveillance powers. Division Three also had arrest authority and tactical officers. It engaged in tactical and operational missions within the UK's borders to investigate and neutralise threats. Division Three was based in Thames House.

758,/wiki/Bell_Rocket_Belt,"The Bell Rocket Belt was a low-power rocket propulsion device manufactured by Bell Aerosystems that allowed an individual to safely travel or leap over small distances. The equipment first appeared in the 1965 James Bond film, Thunderball. The rocket belt proved popular and made a cameo appearance in 2002's, Die Another Day, and was usable in the 2005 video game, From Russia with Love.
In the early 1960s, Bell Aerosystems built a rocket pack which it called the ""Bell Rocket Belt"" or ""man-rocket"" for the US Army, using hydrogen peroxide as fuel. This rocket belt's propulsion works with superheated water vapour. A gas cylinder contains nitrogen gas, and two cylinders containing highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide. The nitrogen presses the hydrogen peroxide onto a catalyst, which decomposes the hydrogen peroxide into a mixture of superheated steam and oxygen with a temperature of about 740 °C. This was led by two insulated curved tubes to two nozzles where it blasted out, supplying the recoil. The pilot can vector the thrust by altering the direction of the nozzles through hand-operated controls. To protect from resulting burns the pilot had to wear insulating clothes.
Despite achieving enormous success demonstrating the rocket pack in action before the public, the US army was disappointed. The maximum duration of flight of the rocket pack was 21 seconds, with a range of only 120 m. An entire command of service personnel needed to accompany the rocket pack. During flight 5 U.S. gallons (19 liters) of hydrogen peroxide was expended. In the opinion of the military, the ""Bell Rocket Belt"" was more a spectacular toy than an effective means of transport. The army spent $150,000 on the Bell Aerosystems contract. Bell spent an additional $50,000. The army refused any further expenditure on the Small Rocket Lift Device (SRLD) program, and the contract was cancelled.
The rocket could carry a man over 9-meter-high obstacles and reached a speed of 11 to 16 km/h. However, its flying time was limited to 20 seconds. Apart from the extremely limited working time, this rocket belt did not allow for a controlled landing should its drive fail, as it would operate at altitudes far too low for a parachute to function. This represents a substantial safety risk and differentiates the rocket belt from airplanes and helicopters, which can land safely without power by gliding or autorotation.
The pack's pilot wears shielding overalls made of thermal resistant material, since the exhaust jet and the engine's pipes are very hot. The crash helmet (which has inside it the signal buzzer) is put on. The rocket thrust-chamber's supersonic exhaust jet makes a deafeningly loud sound (by force to 130 decibels), more like a shrill screech than the roar of an aeroplane's jet engine.
The pack has two levers, rigidly connected to the engine installation. Pressing on these levers, the pilot deflects the nozzles back, and the pack flies forward. Accordingly, raising this lever makes the pack move back. It is possible to lean the engine installation to the sides (because of the ball and socket joint) to fly sideways.
Control with the aid of the lever is somewhat rough; for finer control the pilot uses a handle on the left lever. This handle governs the tips of the jet nozzles. The tips (jetavators) are spring-opposed and can with the aid of the flexible thrusts be slanted forward or back. The pilot inclines the handle forward or back and slants both nozzle tips at the same time to fly straight. If pilot must turn, he turns handle, to slant the nozzles in opposite directions, one forward, another back, turning the pilot and the pack around its axis. By the combination of different motions of lever handles the pilot can fly any way, even sideways, to turn, rotate on the spot, etc.
The pilot can control his rocket pack's flight differently, by changing the center of gravity of his body. For example, if we bend the legs and raise them to the stomach, the center of gravity will move forwards, and pack will be inclined and it will also fly forward. Such a control of pack, with the aid of the body, is considered incorrect and is characteristic of novices. Most experienced pilot Bill Suitor asserts that during the flight it is necessary to hold legs together and straight, and to control flight by the pack's levers and handles. This is the only way to learn to competently pilot the pack and to confidently carry out complex aerial maneuvers.
On the right lever it is the ""gas handle"". In the fixed state it completely shuts the fuel regulator into the engine. Turning the handle counterclockwise, the pilot increases the engine thrust. During servicing of the pack with compressed nitrogen the handle is fixed in the closed position with a shear pin. The timer is on the same handle. Since the pack has fuel for only for 21 seconds of flight, it is necessary to know when the pack will run out of fuel, so that the pilot is not 10 meters above the ground when his tanks are empty.
Before the flight the timer is set for 21 second. When pilot turns the handle for the takeoff, the timer begins counting and will give second-by-second signals to a buzzer in the pilot's helmet. In 15 seconds the signal becomes continuous, telling the pilot that it is time to land.
A Bell Rocket Belt is used in the pre-title sequence of the 1965 James Bond film, Thunderball. After Bond assassinates SPECTRE operative, Jacques Bouvar, he uses a rocket belt to escape from the colonel's security men by making a short flight from the roof of the château to his Aston Martin DB5 parked nearby. Presumably this is the same method he used to gain access to the château just prior to Bouvar's arrival.
The flight sequence makes use of a combination of rear projection effects featuring actor Sean Connery and an actual 20 second flight by pilot Bill Suitor. Initially, to appear more debonair, 007 was to fly the jet pack without a helmet. Indeed, some publicity photos and promotional material of Connery with the jet pack lacked a helmet. However, it was later decided that he should wear a helmet after the pilot refused to make the flight without one for safety reasons.
The rocket belt proved popular and made a cameo appearance in 2002's Die Another Day and is a feature borrowed for the video game adaptation of From Russia with Love.

However, in 2010, Kritzerland Records issued a remastered version of the soundtrack. This limited edition of 1,000 units presented the original album tracks in two parts. The first part used what survived of the original album masters (as they had suffered wear over the intervening decades, and the remainder of the score was unavailable for use on the reissue), was digitally and sonically restored using current technology, and was re-edited so as the music is presented in the order they appeared in the film. Some previously unreleased brief cues were added to this mix, including the aforementioned vocal version of the end title music. The second part was presented in the original LP order, and to address the issue of the sound quality of vinyl, part two was remastered directly from pristine vinyl copies of the LP.
In 2012, for the 45th anniversary Quartet Records released an anniversary edition of the soundtrack, containing 2 CD's with the complete score of the movie. While the second disc contained the original 13-track album, the first disc presented the full score of the film.

His corpse was discovered later that evening by Bond, after Count Lippe brought it back to Shrublands health farm, disguised as the same bandaged patient whom Palazzi had been posing as. His dog-tags and watch were later recovered from Palazzi's corpse on-board the downed Vulcan.
His murder was ultimately avenged by his sister Dominique, who shot Emilio Largo, the mastermind of the conspiracy, dead while he was in a fight with Bond.
In the novel, the hijacked aircraft is a Villiers Vindicator, rather than a Vulcan.
In the unofficial non-EON 1983 film, Never Say Never Again, which was based on Thunderball and also starred Sean Connery as Bond, the character of Jack Petachi was a pastiche of Giuseppe Petachi and Francois Derval. In this film, Jack Petachi is a US Air Force officer who conspires with SPECTRE to hijack nuclear weapons through genetic surgery where one of his eyes is altered to match the same retina pattern as the President of the United States, thus allowing Petachi access to the desired weaponry.

Ultimately, Charnage's incompetence led to a boy called James Bond taking the machine's designer Alexis Fairburn being rescued from them. Sedova then had Charnage killed by his own mercenary henchman, Ludwig Smith, and went to take Fairburn back, and ended up with Perry Mandeville as an additional hostage as she and one of her lieutenants dragged Fairburn through London's abandoned Pneumatic Rail System tunnels. She eventually dropped Mandeville after hitting him with her gun, and eventually became aware of Bond's presence. She bade him not to follow her, but he and Mandeville attacked, and sent her associate into a large fan in the tunnel floor, killing him. Bond however, landed on the walkway over the fan, and held a gun at Sedova, who was doing the same to him. She employed distraction tactics to throw him off guard, but he saw through them, but Sedova, knowing he would not pull the trigger, was allowed to walk away.

It is located at Pinewood Studios, Iver, Buckinghahire, United Kingdo, and named after the famous James Bond film producer Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli.
The stage was originally conceived in 1976 by production designer Ken Adam to house the set he had designed for the interior of the Liparus supertanker in the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. The stage was christened the ""007 Stage"" on December 5, 1976 during a ceremony attended by the then-current British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson. In contrast to the volcano crater set Adam had built for You Only Live Twice in 1966, the 007 Stage would be a permanent structure that could be rented out to other productions.

767,/wiki/Francisco_Scaramanga_(Christopher_Lee),"Francisco Scaramanga, also known as The Man with the Golden Gun, was a fictional professional assassin and hitman who served as the titular main antagonist in EON Productions' 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun. Portrayed by the late British actor Christopher Lee, he was based from the literary character who appeared in Ian Fleming's 1959 novel. Scaramanga also appeared in games derived from the franchise, most notably in the 1986 James Bond 007 tabletop role-playing game and in Electronic Arts' 2004 video-game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent
Francisco Scaramanga was a British national born in a travelling circus. His father, a Cuban expatriate, was the ringmaster, and his British mother was a snake charmer. By the age of ten, he was part of the circus as a trick-shot pistol marksman; a skill which he put to use when he shot and killed an abusive animal trainer after the man killed an elephant that had befriended Scaramanga.
By the age of fifteen, he had left the circus and was working as a gunman in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He was recruited there by the KGB and trained in Eastern Europe where, for many years, he was basically ""just another overworked and underpaid assassin"" for the KGB. He quit the KGB in the late 1950s, becoming an independent hitman-for-hire charging one million dollars a kill. Among his victims is Bill Fairbanks, MI6 agent 002. All of Scaramanga's dealings go through his diminutive accomplice Nick Nack, which allows Scaramanga to remain anonymous. No photographs of him exist, but he has unusual anatomy: a third nipple. As in the novel, it is shown that Scaramanga makes love prior to killing in the belief that it ""improves the eye"".
During the events of the film, he is at the very apex of his career. Consequently, Scaramanga lives very well, drawing from the exorbitant sums of money he charges to carry out his assassinations and has built his home on his own private island somewhere off the coast of south-eastern China (apparently part of a deal with the Chinese to carry out assassinations in their name in return). Scaramanga lives alone, accompanied only by Nick Nack, Andrea Anders (his kept woman), and a mechanic named Kra who is in charge of maintenance and security.
Scaramanga also uses some of his wealth to finance research and development of technologies that rival those developed by MI6's Q Branch. Such technologies include his infamous Golden Gun, a car that transforms into an aircraft and a solar-powered laser cannon. In addition, Scaramanga also has a private junk, which Bond later steals to get off the exploding island.
In addition to his career as an assassin, Scaramanga is also a junior partner in Hai Fat Enterprises and personal assassin to the company's owner, multimillionaire industrialist Hai Fat. Prior to the film's events, a British scientist named Gibson was employed by Mr. Fat to develop a solution to the world's ongoing energy crisis. With the help of Mr. Fat's construction company, a highly efficient solar power plant is constructed on Scaramanga's island. However, following its completion, Gibson attempts to return to Britain; bargaining for immunity with a critical component of the powerplant: the Solex Agitator unit.
With Gibson having outlived his usefulness, Francisco is dispatched by Hai Fat to assassinate the scientist and recover the Solex. After meeting with his British contact at a Hong Kong club (the ""Bottoms Up"" club), Gibson is assassinated and his invention is stolen from the crime scene by Nick Nack. Scaramanga initially returns the device to Mr. Fat, but following James Bond's interference, Mr. Fat rants about Scaramanga's actions and regrets over making him a partner of the business; as a result, Scaramanga instead decides to kill his employer and take the Solex, power plant and company for himself. With Hai Fat's assets in his possession, Scaramanga plans to sell Gibson's solar technology to the highest bidder, which was a huge concern given the recent events of the 1973 oil crisis. Criminality was of no concern to Scaramanga, as anyone who paid up would be the new owner, no matter who they were: a government, a terrorist, an industrialist, or whoever.
Scaramanga also desires to test his skills against the famed James Bond, whom he regards as the only man capable of being his equal. After taking the solex from Scaramanga's safe, Anders attempts to deliver it to Bond. However, Scaramanga discovers the theft and shoots her in the chest as she waits for 007 in a kickboxing arena. He searches her handbag before the spy arrives, but fails to find the device, which has fallen under her seat. Meeting Bond face-to-face for the first time, he relates the story of his upbringing, his fascination with guns and his love of killing. As the pair talk, Bond notices the Solex and manages to slip it to his colleague Hip, presently disguised as a food seller at the fight, who in turn passes it to fellow agent Mary Goodnight.
After excusing himself, Scaramanga leaves empty-handed, only to discover Goodnight attempting to place a tracking device on his car. With one fluid movement he shoves her into the boot and slams the door shut. Despite Bond's best attempts to pursue the villain (with questionable help from J.W. Pepper), he and Nick Nack manage to evade pursuit and capture by taking to the skies with an aircraft attachment on the roof of the car, taking with them Goodnight and the Solex.
Picking up Goodnight's homing beacon, Bond flies a seaplane into Red Chinese waters, under the Chinese radar, and lands at Scaramanga's island. On arriving, Bond is welcomed by Scaramanga, who shows him the high-tech solar power plant he has built. Whilst demonstrating the equipment, Scaramanga uses a powerful solar beam to destroy Bond's plane. Following the tour, Bond dines with Goodnight and Scaramanga. As they eat, the assassin states that despite his 'working for peanuts', Bond and he are very much alike. Bond angrily disagrees with this comparison and the two have a tense standoff, which results in Scaramanga threatening the agent with his golden gun and Bond admitting to Scaramanga that killing him would be ""a pleasure"".
At gunpoint, Scaramanga challenges Bond to one final, decisive duel - his golden gun versus 007's Walther PPK, dismissing Bond's superior number of bullets irrelevant due to his superior knowledge of the local environment, saying ""I only need one"". Reluctantly, Bond agrees, and the pair assemble on the beach after lunch, with Nick Nack supervising.
After the traditional twenty paces, Bond turns and fires, only to find that the assassin has cheated the duel, fled into the fun-house - a labyrinthine styled maze, where Scaramanga and his opponents (all hired by Nick Nack) regularly duel to the death. Bond spots Nick Nack and suspects him of helping Scaramanga, but Nick Nack rectifies that if Bond kills Scaramanga, all his assets will be his, so he has no intention to help Scaramanga. Consequently, Nick Nack guides Bond to the fun-house to finish the duel. The two men stalk each other around the maze, culminating in 007 taking the place of a mannequin replica of himself. Fooled by Bond's ploy, Scaramanga is shot directly through the heart when Bond takes him by surprise. He falls to the ground, dead, with his golden gun dropping beside him.
Francisco Scaramanga can be described as ""tall, dark, and handsome"", alluding to his short black hair with a widow's peak, his dark brown eyes, and ruggedly masculine, handsome face, along with his tanned skin. He stands at an imposing six feet, five inches tall (6'5""), his body trim and slightly muscular. His most unusual feature is an extra nipple.
He is often seen in a white suit, and wears a ring with a huge stone on the little fingers of each of his hands, Anders noting he always wears gold jewellery. When swimming, he wears dark blue swimming trunks, and during his gun fight with Rodney, the assassin summoned by Nick Nack in the opening scene, he wore a royal blue track suit.
Upon welcoming James Bond to his island home, Scaramanga dressed in a short sleeved, high collared, white polo shirt paired with light pants and loafers.
Scaramanga was an eccentric, arrogant, ruthless, ambitious and sadistic assassin; he was different from James Bond's other adversaries in the sense that he was not a terrorist intent on world domination, but simply an assassin who didn't feel any fear when having to test his skills against those sent to try and kill him, thus the trailer description of ""The Most Dangerous Man Alive"". He had immense self-confidence in his skills as a marksman and was almost dismissive that only James Bond was his singular equal.
The assassin showed paranoia when surrounded by characters such as Hai Fat and Andrea Anders; he did not tolerate Hai Fat talking down to him, or his mistress's betrayal, resulting in him killing them both.
Scaramanga also has a sardonic, sarcastic, and somewhat childish sense of humor, joking before killing Hai Fat ""What do they teach in that school? Ballet dancing?"", referring to the martial arts school owned by his employer, much to the man's annoyance; after killing Hai Fat for talking down to him, he remarked ""He always did like that mausoleum. Put him in it."" Another instance where his sense of humor is displayed is when he finds Mary Goodnight placing a tracking device in the trunk of his car; instead of confronting her outright, or even killing her on the spot, he startles her by grabbing her from behind and shoving her into the boot in one fluid movement before slamming the lid down with a smug, self-satisfied smirk. Upon entering the dining room of his home following James Bond's arrival, and seeing his somewhat flabbergasted expression when he saw Mary Goodnight's attire, an amused Scaramanga dryly commented that he likes a girl in a bikini since she can't hide carry any hidden weapons on her.
Scaramanga is also shown to be somewhat calm and relaxed, never getting flustered even in hair raising situations; he was even gentlemanly in demeanor and speech, but once crossed, he reveals his cold, ruthless side without blinking; when his dark side emerges, his normally calm brown eyes take on a cold, intense look that would scare even the most seasoned killers, at some points even seeming to put Bond on edge. He only shows real anger when Bond questions his qualifications as a 'gentleman'. 
Despite being somewhat coldblooded, it is quite interesting to note that upon narrating his backstory to Bond, Scaramanga looked somewhat grim, even pained when he mentioned the elephant that he had befriended as a young boy, and its tragic death at the hands of its abusive handler, showing that he had truly cared for the animal; he only smiled when revealing how he avenged his only friend, by shooting and killing the trainer in question.
Scaramanga was an expert marksman with his golden gun and an adept at deep cover. Although his island was equipped with various advanced technology, such as a laser cannon and an advanced independent power supply, he claims not to be well-versed in science personally, simply relying on others, such as Kra, to do the actual work. He is also a proficient pilot and aviator, judging by the plane he takes to escape Bond. Judging by the fitness equipment on the island, he is in peak physical condition.
Bond observes that Scaramanga lives extremely well with his own cordon bleu chef and an expensive wine cellar. He also seems to enjoy oysters served with Guinness and tabasco sauce and has an extensive collection of pistols including a Colt Python 357 Magnum, Colt 38 Detective Special, Smith and Wesson 44 Magnum and Colt Single Action Army in 45 Long.   
Ian Fleming named Francisco Scaramanga after a fellow student at Eton with whom he shared a lasting rivalry. Following several schoolground spats Fleming decided to use the animosity he felt towards George Scaramanga for the influence behind one of his most famous villains. Fleming and Scaramanga were at Eton in the 1930s until the Bond author was expelled.
The role was offered to Jack Palance, but he turned it down. 
The character has been featured as a villain in various James Bond video games.
Francisco Scaramanga is a playable character in the multiplayer portions of the 2002 game Nightfire and the 2010 game GoldenEye 007. In the original GoldenEye game, it is said in the briefing for the ""Egyptian"" mission that the Golden Gun was stolen from Scaramanga by Baron Samedi.

768,/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Brouse,"Lieutenant François Brouse a minor character in the 1995 film GoldenEye and is portrayed by British stuntman Simon Crane.
Lieutenant François Brouse was the co-pilot of the new helicopter prototype the Tiger. Uniquely manoeuvrable, the Tiger not only uses Stealth technology, it is alos hardened against all form of electronic interference, radio jamming and electromagnetic radiation. He and his captain Lt. Commander Bernard Jaubert has made the test flight, but Xenia Onatopp whistled to the pilots and told them she will be the surprise after the test. When they thought they are in heaven, Xenia shot them on their chest, took their clothes and stole the helicopter before James Bond arrived.

769,/wiki/Gobinda,"Gobinda is generally seen accompanying Kamal Khan wherever he goes, and performing various other duties, mainly security based. British agent James Bond first spies the tall, imposing man when Gobinda is acting as chauffeur for Khan and his henchwoman Magda in a street after the Sotheby's auction. Later in India, it is clear Gobinda means business when he destroys the rigged dice after Bond defeats Kamal in a game of backgammon at the hotel casino. Then later, he and Khan's other henchmen chase Bond and his Indian ally, Vijay, through the streets of Delhi driving tuk-tuks and try unsuccessfully to shoot 007 and Vijay. Ultimately the goon captures Bond after Magda seduces the spy and steals the real Fabergé egg. He takes the agent to stay as Kahn's 'guest' at the Monsoon Palace, where 007 finds out that Khan is working with General Orlov.
Later, Gobinda fights Bond on Octopussy's train in Germany but fails in killing him when the British falls off the train. He notices 007 when they are leaving the circus and informs Khan, who says to let their enemy keep going and that he will soon die in the explosion. However, Bond and Octopussy manage to deactivate the bomb and return to India to attack Kamal Khan. During the assault on and in Khan's palace, Octopussy gets captured by Khan and Gobinda, who escape the palace and into a plane. Bond follows them and jumps on the plane, disabling one of its engines in the process. Khan so instructs Gobinda to fight 007 atop the plane, albeit understandably with some reluctance. His reluctance was with good concern, as that was a very risky venture that ultimately led to Gobinda's doom. Bond figured he was outmatched and wing-walking makes a poor choice for a battleground. While Gobinda is attempting to grab Bond, 007 pulls back the plane's antenna and snaps it at Gobinda's head. Gobinda screams in pain due to the blistering sting of the antenna's snap, and it also causes him to loosen his arm's grip on the fuselage, causing him to fall to his death.

770,/wiki/009_(Octopussy),"009 is an unnamed operative of the British Secret Service, who, like all 00 Agents, possesses a discretionary 'Licence to Kill' in the field. He is shown at the beginning of the film in East Berlin disguised as a clown and fleeing with a fake Fabergé egg he stole from Octopussy's circus. The theft has not gone unnoticed and he is pursued by knife-throwing twins Mischka and Grischka, who wound him as he attempts to pass through the surrounding forest.
Attempting to escape across a bridge, he is struck by one of the twin's knives and plunges into the river. Assuming him to be dead, the twins break off their pursuit, allowing a fatally wounded 009 to scramble from the riverbank and get to the British ambassador's residence. Smashing through the window, the operative collapses to the floor dead; the egg slipping from his hand and landing at the ambassador's feet. James Bond replaces him, continuing the investigation (Operation Trove) and avenging 009 by killing his murderers.

The BMW 5 Series is a mid-size / executive car manufactured by BMW since 1972. The 520i was only available to the European market and was featured in the John Gardner novel Win, Lose or Die.
The BMW E34 is a version of the BMW 5 Series automobile built from February 1988 to 1995 with the Touring model ending June 1996. It replaced the BMW E28 in 1988 and was replaced by the E39 in 1996.
During the course of Win, Lose or Die M prohibits Bond from taking his Bentley Mulsanne Turbo and recommends that he opt for a more subtle car from the company car pool; a BMW 520i in unobtrusive dark-blue.
BMW 5-series cars from the E34 generation have appeared in several Bond movies as well, although never with a particular role.

772,/wiki/Casino_Royale_(1967_film),"Casino Royale is a 1967 comedy spy film originally produced by Columbia Pictures starring an ensemble cast of directors and actors. It is set as a satire of the James Bond film series and the spy genre, and is loosely based on Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel.
Evelyn Tremble/James Bond 007 (Peter Sellers) and Inspector Mathis meet in a pissoir (public urinal), where Mathis presents his credentials—in a shot suggesting a display of Mathis' genitals, and setting the tone of the film by satirizing the dramatic opening sequences in the EON Bond films.
Sir James, Moneypenny, Mata and Coop manage to escape from their cell and fight their way back to the Casino Director's office where Sir James establishes Vesper is a double agent. The casino is then overrun by secret agents and a battle ensues. Eventually, Jimmy's atomic pill explodes, destroying Casino Royale along with everyone inside. Sir James and all of his agents then appear in heaven and Jimmy Bond is shown descending to hell.
Casino Royale also takes credit for the greatest number of actors in a Bond film either to have appeared or to go on to appear in the rest of the Eon series — besides Ursula Andress in Dr. No, Vladek Sheybal appeared as Kronsteen in From Russia with Love, Fred Haggerty, who played Krilencu, appeared as a background character in the casino, Burt Kwouk featured as Mr. Ling in Goldfinger and an unnamed SPECTRE operative in You Only Live Twice, Jeanne Roland plays a masseuse in You Only Live Twice, and Angela Scoular appeared as Ruby Bartlett in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Jack Gwillim, who had a tiny role as a British army officer, played a Royal Navy officer in Thunderball. Caroline Munro, who was an extra, received the role of Naomi in The Spy Who Loved Me (and also modelled for the cover of the US and UK film tie-in editions of the On Her Majesty's Secret Service novel). Milton Reid, who appears in a bit part as a guard, opening the door to Mata Bond's hall, played Dr. No's Guard and Stromberg's underling, Sandor, in The Spy Who Loved Me. John Wells, Q's assistant, appears in For Your Eyes Only as Denis Thatcher.
The film is notable for the legendary behind-the-scenes drama involving the filming of the segments with Peter Sellers. Supposedly, Sellers felt intimidated by Orson Welles to the extent that, except for a couple of shots, neither was in the studio simultaneously. Other versions of the legend depict the drama stemming from Sellers being slighted, in favour of Welles, by Princess Margaret (whom Sellers knew) during her visit to the set. Welles also insisted on performing magic tricks as Le Chiffre, and the director obliged. Director Val Guest wrote that Welles did not think much of Sellers, and had refused to work with ""that amateur"".
Years later, as a result of the Sony/Comcast acquisition of MGM, Columbia would once again become responsible for the co-distribution of this 1967 version as well as the entire Eon Bond series, including the 2006 adaptation of Casino Royale. However, MGM Home Entertainment changed its distributor to 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in May 2006, and MGM Television started to self-distribute again. Sony still controls the 2006 adaptation and theatrical rights to this version.

773,/wiki/Blofeld_(Literary),"In the novel series by Ian Fleming, Blofeld makes three appearances in what is considered the 'Blofeld Trilogy'. In John Griswold's 'Ian Fleming's James Bond', George Almond provided illustrations depicting Blofeld in each novel, based on Fleming's own descriptions of the character.
Fleming details Blofeld's background in the novel Thunderball; none of his background is ever revealed in the Bond films. Ernst Stavro Blofeld was born on May 28, 1908 to a Polish father and a Greek mother in Gdynia. Blofeld attended the University of Warsaw where he studied economics and political history. He later went to the Warsaw Technical Institute to study engineering and radionics. He then took a communication position with the Polish government, at the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. He began to use his position for insider trading, buying and selling stocks at the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Foreseeing World War II, Blofeld made copies of top-secret wires and sold them to Nazi Germany. Before the German invasion of Poland in 1939, he destroyed all records of his existence, then moved to Turkey, where he worked for Turkish radio and set up an intelligence organization. During the war, he sold information to both sides. After the defeat of Erwin Rommel, he decided to back the Allied war effort; ironically, he was awarded numerous medals by the Allied powers after the war's end. After the war, Blofeld temporarily moved to South America before founding SPECTRE.
Despite his willingness to murder millions to get what he wants, Blofeld has a few professional scruples. For instance, in the novel Thunderball he learned that during a standard fundraising kidnapping mission of a young girl, the responsible agent had sexual relations with her. Although Blofeld says that the relations may have been ""voluntary or involuntary on the girl's part,"" he had the agent killed as punishment and returned the girl and half the ransom to her father as compensation. His reasons had nothing to do with morality, but rather with the importance of SPECTRE being known for keeping their word to those they did their ""business"" with. Blofeld ruled by fear mixed with respect from his subordinates. When a SPECTRE agent fell out of line he was publicly made an example of with various methods of death.
Blofeld finishes looking over his cohorts in crime, noting the one member of SPECTRE who evades his glance. He takes a violet-scented breath freshener, as is his custom before saying something disagreeable. Blofeld reviews SPECTRE's crimes of the last few years, including drugs, espionage, and blackmail, netting a healthy profit to the criminal organization. The current undertaking is Plan Omega, a much more profitable venture.
Blofeld moves on to discuss the last undertaking, a kidnapping. He has No. 7, one of the French mafia men, stand. Blofeld recounts how the kidnapped girl was molested during the kidnapping. Perhaps it was consensual, perhaps not, but it violated SPECTRE's promise to return the girl untouched. As a result, Blofeld has returned half of the million-dollar ransom. The standing man, No. 7, knows he is innocent and No. 12 is guilty, but he trusts Blofeld and remains standing. Blofeld then promptly kills No. 12 and acknowledges that he was merely using No. 7 to throw No. 12 off guard.
In You Only Live Twice published in 1964, Blofeld returns and is found by Bond to be in hiding in Japan under the alias Dr. Guntram Shatterhand. In this appearance rather than being just thin has gained some muscles, has a gold-capped tooth, a fully healed nose, and a drooping grey mustache. Bond describes Blofeld on their confrontation as being ""a big man, perhaps six foot three (190 cm), and powerfully built"". Bond strangles him to death at the end of the novel. In both On Her Majesty's Secret Service and You Only Live Twice, he is aided in his schemes by Irma Bunt, who is clearly his lover in the latter and posing as Shatterhand's wife. Bond incapacitates her in their Japanese castle base before it blows up, killing Bunt.
The final mention of Blofeld is in the beginning of the next book, The Man with the Golden Gun, published in 1965.
"
774,/wiki/Franz_Sanchez,"El Patrón (The Boss)Founder and head of the Sanchez CartelFranz Sanchez was a fictional powerful and ruthless Central American drug baron who heads a powerful Central American criminal cartel. He was responsible for the maiming of Felix Leiter and the death of his wife triggering the anger of James Bond. The main antagonist in the 1989 James Bond film, Licence to Kill, he was portrayed by American actor, Robert Davi, and also appeared in John Gardner's accompanying novelisation. Still portrayed by Davi, the character would later be re-imagined for Activision's 2012 James Bond video game, 007 Legends.
Franz Sanchez is a Mexican drug lord running his own empire from the fictitious Republic of Isthmus. Owner of a large luxury estate, protected by an army of henchmen and controller of the city President, Sanchez has either bribed, intimidated or killed most of the government’s officials. Heading an international drugs cartel Sanchez is both ruthless and merciless, yet is cultured, refined and a man of his word. Sanchez rewards loyalty but promises death to anyone who double-crosses him. With paranoid tendencies relating to the loyalty of his men, James Bond is able to exploit this weakness to manipulate Sanchez into killing several of his own men; convincing him of their disloyalty.
Prompted to leave the safety of his lair by the betrayal of his mistress, Lupe Lamora, Sanchez traveled to the Bahamas with his enforcers; catching her in bed with another man, Alvarez. Ordering Dario to cut out the man's heart as an ironic gesture, Sanchez then severely whips her with the tail of a stingray. As Sanchez makes his way back to the nearby airfield, he is intercepted by a DEA team comprised of Felix Leiter and James Bond (ostensibly, as an ""observer""). Amid the chaos, Sanchez takes to the air in a stolen Beechcraft 18 and sets course for Cuba. The agents pursue him by helicopter and hook his aircraft in mid-flight, taking him into custody. During Sanchez's transportation to a prison, DEA agent Ed Killifer succumbs to a $2 million dollar bribe and assists the drug lord's escape by driving the prison van into the sea. Scuba divers sent by Sanchez's associate, Milton Krest, then help them make their underwater escape. Meanwhile, his henchmen Dario, Perez and Braun ambush Leiter and his wife Della on the night of their wedding. After repaying Killifer for his loyalty, Sanchez enacts his vengeance on Leiter by having him dunked into a shark tank at Ocean Exotica. When Bond returns to Leiter's house to find Della dead (and it is implied, raped) and Felix alive, but seriously wounded, he swears to take his revenge on Sanchez. Consequently, Bond boards the Wavekrest – a ship owned by Krest – and foils the kingpin's latest drug shipment, stealing five million dollars in the process.
After maiming Leiter, Sanchez is smuggled back to safety in Isthmus, where he acquires four Stinger missiles from the Contras and threatens to shoot down an American airliner if the DEA refuses to back off. He meets with five Asian drug lords as part of his goal of expanding his cocaine empire to incorporate the Pacific region; offering each of the men exclusive franchises in his narcotic product, priced at one million US dollars per territory. Unaware that one of the men is actually a Hong Kong narcotics agent, he reluctantly agrees to takes them on a tour of his main distribution centre. Bond has also traveled to Isthmus on the trail of Sanchez, and after making some winnings in the kingpin's Isthmus casino, he approaches him seeking employment in his organization (introducing himself as a ""problem eliminator""). After reconnoitering the establishment, Bond notes that Sanchez is well protected, sitting behind two inches of armored glass. Using plastic explosives, 007 attempts to demolish the window and snipe the drug lord from an adjacent building site. Despite detonating the explosives, two Hong Kong Narcotics officers foil Bond's assassination attempt and take him to their safe house for questioning. Attacking the building with a tank, Sanchez and the Isthmian militia inadvertently rescue Bond and kill the officers, believing them to be the assassins.
Now ingratiated with Sanchez and nursed back to health at his private villa, Bond sets about destroying his operation by turning him against his own employees. Taking advantage of Franz's paranoia (with the aid of informant Pam Bouvier, Q and Lupe Lamora) Bond frames Krest by placing the five million dollars he had stolen into a hyperbaric chamber on board the Wavekrest. A furious Sanchez traps Krest in the chamber and then rapidly depressurizes it with an axe, killing him gruesomely. When Perez asks about the money, Sanchez just tells him to launder it. For Bond's perceived loyalty, Sanchez admits him into his inner circle and takes him to the narcotics refinery along with the Orientals. Bond learns that Sanchez's scientists can dissolve cocaine in gasoline and then sell it disguised as fuel to Asian drug dealers. The buying and selling are conducted via the televangelist Professor Joe Butcher, working under orders from Sanchez's business manager Truman-Lodge. Four tanker trucks loaded with the mixture were prepared for the drug lords (pending their agreement). However, during the presentation Dario recognizes Bond and betrays him to Sanchez. Bond starts a fire in the laboratory and attempts to flee, but is captured, bound by the hands and feet, and placed on a conveyor belt that drops brick-cocaine into a giant shredder.
While being fed along the conveyor belt, Bond directs Sanchez's paranoid attention to his head of security, Heller's absence during the fire, stating ""That's the last you'll see of Heller and your Stingers"". The drug lord finds Heller in the middle of moving the Stingers from his helicopter and tells him to move the Stingers to his car, whilst exchanging a knowing glance at his enforcer Braun. Shortly thereafter, Heller is impaled on the forks of a forklift. Sanchez flees as the fire consumes the facility, taking with him the four articulated tankers; pursued by Bond and Bouvier in a light aircraft. During the course of the chase through the desert, three of the four tankers are destroyed, sending the cartel's profits up in smoke. Sanchez resorts to wastefully using the Stingers against 007, remarking ""Don't worry. It's only money"". Having failed to kill him, he personally attacks Bond aboard the final remaining tanker, accidentally severing the break line with a machete; causing it to veer out of control and crash down a hill side. Bloodied and soaked in petrol from the leaking tanker, Sanchez raises his blade to kill Bond, lamenting that he ""could have had everything"" by working under him rather betraying him. The incapacitated agent asks ""don't you want to know why?"", revealing his cigarette lighter – the Leiters' gift for being the best man at their wedding – and ignites Sanchez's clothing, showing that Bond wants vengeance. Burning, Sanchez stumbles into the wrecked tanker causing a violent explosion which kills him, avenging Felix and Della.
Franz Sanchez also appears in the video game 007 Legends which takes its inspiration from the final act of Licence to Kill. In it, Sanchez is an infamous drug dealer operating out of Mexico and ruling over a vast criminal empire that stretches from North America down into Chile and Argentina; from the poppy fields of Afghanistan, to cocaine processing facilities in Colombia, and counterfeit goods and money laundering in Egypt. Sanchez was drawn to the drug trade from an early age, first raw material production, then refinement and shipping until he eventually became a dealer himself. His ruthless business ethic led him to the top and he now commands the largest drugs cartel in all of Central and South America; cultivating successful business partnerships with gangs from the far east, Russia and central Eurasia. Infamously purchasing information and favor from government officials at a price of one million US dollars, his legitimate business interests include owning a bank in his native Colombia and a casino in the Mexican city of Chihuahua.
Prior to the events of 007 Legends, Sanchez brutally maims James Bond's friend, Felix Leiter, feeding him to a shark and murdering his wife Della. In a flashback sequence, Bond visits Leiter at home, discovering the carnage and pummeling one of Sanchez's thugs. Leiter provides the spy with a cigarette lighter containing intelligence on Sanchez and tells him to warn one of his agents, Pam Bouvier. The pair team up and infiltrate Sanchez's operation; with Bouvier claiming to defect from the DEA, returning $2 million of Sanchez's money the agency had recently seized from a cartel courier. Meanwhile, 007 is officially tasked by MI6 with investigating the drug lord's close ties to a shadowy faction of terrorists based out of the middle east. Operating an enormous narcotics refinery under the cover of an old Otomi temple, Sanchez shows Pam around the laboratories whilst 007 gathers evidence of arms smuggling and plants explosives around the complex. The drug lord discovers her covert listening device, blowing her cover and forcing 007 to detonate the explosives; knocking Sanchez unconscious and pinning Pam under wreckage. Introducing himself to the kingpin as 'a friend of Leiter', Bond beats him before being tackled by his enforcer, Dario. Taking advantage of the chaos, Sanchez flees in a gasoline tanker loaded with his cocaine mixture. Bond and Bouvier pursue him, eventually boarding the tanker and brawling until the vehicle veers out of control and crashes. Staggering through the wreckage, the pair fight until 007 gains the upper hand - knocking him to the ground and hurling Leiter's cigarette lighter at the gasoline-doused drug lord.
"
775,/wiki/00_Agent,"The 00 Section of MI6 is considered the secret service's elite. A 00 (typically read ""Double O"" and denoted in Fleming's novels by the letters ""OO"" rather than the digits ""00"") is a field agent that holds a licence to kill in the field, at their discretion, to complete any mission. Standard mandatory retirement age is 45 though various writers including Ian Fleming, Sebastian Faulks and John Gardner have contradicted this as a matter of Poetic License and several actors who have portrayed Bond on film have been older than 45 at the time of playing the character. Although Fleming only mentioned five 00 agents, others have been added over the years across various franchise media.
The following list is of the known members of this elite order who have been referenced in officially licenced James Bond fiction: novels, films, video games, and comic strips (not including impostors).
"
776,/wiki/Elektra%27s_Pilot,"Elektra's Pilot was a fictional unnamed man who appeared briefly in the 1999 James Bond film The World is not Enough. He was portrayed by British actor John Albasiny.
Not much is known about the man who pilots Elektra King's green Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin 2. When taking Elektra and Bond into the Caucasus mountains to check the survey lines, he speaks with an Eastern European accent while telling Elektra that he is not able to land due to strong winds.
Although the pilot might just be a harmless employee like anybody else, Elektra later tells her henchmen to take M (who she just took hostage by killing her bodyguards) 'to the helicopter' (the Dauphin 2 is parked nearby) - the pilot might also be involved in the plot, or is at least knowing.
"
777,/wiki/Gareth_Mallory,"Lieutenant Colonel Gareth Mallory (also known by the initial ""M"") is the current Head of Secret Intelligence Service — also known as MI6 — and is portrayed by actor Ralph Fiennes.
Introduced in the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall as the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, Mallory assumes the role of M following the untimely death of the outgoing Head of MI6.
Mallory is a former Lieutenant Colonel in the SAS, who served in Northern Ireland and spent three months as a hostage in the hands of the IRA. His distinguishing trait is that during his wrongful incarceration he steadfastly refused to divulge confidential information; a fact that seems to have impressed the originally cynical James Bond.
Later on, during the inquiry, Raoul Silva, who recently escaped after disabling MI6's defense system, breaks in with two other henchmen of his and plans on shooting M but Mallory manages to jump in the way and took the bullet to his left shoulder. Despite the injury, Mallory helped Eve and 007 by picking up a dead police officer's Glock 17 and shoots one of Silva's henchmen and after James shoots the fire extinguishers which created a smokescreen, Mallory helped Miss Moneypenny in evacuating the parliamentary ministers and inquiry members out of the courthouse building. He was treated by medics and was given an arm sling. Returning to MI6 after the firefight, Mallory discovered Q and Bill Tanner making a complex electronic trail for Silva to single-handedly to follow, hoping to help Bond and M lure Silva and his henchmen into a trap. To their surprise, he allows them to continue, warning them to not get caught by the Prime Minister. At the end of the film, due to her death, Mallory is given M's alias and position as head of MI6, with the former giving the top secret document to Bond in his next assignment, of which Bond accepts.
When M reads on the headlines about a collapsed building in Mexico, he shows 007 the Guardian newspaper in his office and asked him the purpose of his trip, replying that he was on a holiday. M grounds him temporarily from the field for taking the trip without an official authorization and that it could stir up an international incident. Soon after, a man from the Joint Security Service named Max Denbigh (who is named by the alias of 'C' by Bond), enters the office whom M introduces to 007. M is in the middle of a power struggle between Denbigh's Nine Eyes Committee which would eliminate the need for the ""00"" section.
When it emerges that C is an agent of villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, M, Q, Moneypenny, Bond, and Tanner travel to arrest C and stop the launch of the Nine Eyes programme. En route they are ambushed and Bond is kidnapped. M and the others escape and proceed to wait for C in his office, arrest him and shut down Nine Eyes before it launches; in an ensuing struggle, C is killed. Bond comes close to executing Blofeld but then lets him be arrested by M.
Five years after James Bonds's retirement, M continues as the head of MI6. He has commissioned new agents, including a new 007, Nomi.
Ultimately, M reneges, re-enlisting Bond as an active agent and re-instating his title of 007. He then puts Bond on the mission to take down Safin, with Q and the new agent Nomi (who had been given the 007 title) as support. Bond succeeds in his mission, but is killed in the process, forced to remain behind to ensure the success of the missiles that take out the factory which creates the Project Heracles nanobots. Afterwards, M shares a drink in Bond's honor at MI6 along with Moneypenny, Q, Nomi and Tanner.
Mallory has a very aloof, cynical and sarcastic personality. However, he respects M for her years of service to her country, and isn't cruel to her for her retirement. He is, however, skeptical to the fact that Bond came back after he had the perfect chance of retirement. He remains skeptical and doubtful towards Bond. He also sends Moneypenny to spy on him. It is revealed that Mallory fought against the IRA, and was a prisoner of war at the time. He was possibly embittered by this experience to the point of borderline social detachment to everybody else. This shows both loyalty and bravery hidden beneath Mallory's shell. He eventually comes to respect Bond and fights alongside him during the battle against Silva. He is highly intelligent, as he was the first appointed as the next head of MI6 after his predecessor died.
When first cast in Skyfall, many people speculated that Fiennes would play Bond's arch-nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld as Fiennes is often cast as a villain in most movies.
During the filming of Skyfall, the fact that Fiennes was to become the new M was a closely guarded secret.
Ralph Fiennes is the youngest actor in the role of M, being 49 when he first appeared in the role.

778,/wiki/Golden_ray_submersible,"The unnamed submersible was a fictional golden submarine operated by the criminal organisation, S.C.U.M., under the command of Auric Goldfinger. The vessel appeared in episode 20 (""Cruise to Oblivion"") of the 1991 spin-off animated television series, James Bond Jr..
Shaped like a batoidea, or ray, Auric Goldfinger's golden submersible mimicked the movement of its real aquatic counterpart. Underneath, a moon-pool was built into the hull, along with a sliding hatch that allowed a miniature submarine to exit the craft. On the top side was an entry hatch, flanked by a pair of laser turrets which retracted into the submarine when not in use. Toward its bow were torpedo tubes. Its retrofuturistic golden interior was filled with equipment resembling 19th-century industrial machinery. Looking down on the craft's operators, Goldfinger sat beside a large observation window on a plush golden throne.
The vessel was used in Goldfinger's scheme to raise a sunken galleon and its cargo of gold. After conventional attempts failed, the villain abducted Horace Boothroyd and forced him to concoct a method; using the weight of a sinking cruise liner to pull the wreck to the surface. James Bond Jr. destroyed both torpedoes intended for the cruise ship and boarded the submersible to liberate his friend. Having earlier shot down an American jet fighter, the U.S. Navy had also taken an interest in Goldfinger's activities and arrived to further sabotage his plans. The villain fled in an ""escape torpedo"" before the Navy could take him into custody; leaving the golden submarine to be, presumably, impounded by the American authorities.
"
779,/wiki/Beirut_Cabaret,"This unnamed cabaret / nightclub in Beirut, Lebanon is the first destination during Bond's hunt for Francisco Scaramanga. Five years before the events of The Man with the Golden Gun, in 1969, Scaramanga murdered agent 002, Bill Fairbanks in this location.
In order to retrieve a bullet to get a lead on Scaramanga, Bond travels to Beirut and contacts Saida, a belly dancer who was with Fairbanks, when he was shot.
The club is owned by the Lebanese Club Boss, who dislikes Bond making contact with Saida. After a heavy fistfight, Bond leaves the club's backstage area and gets into a taxi.
None of these scenes were actually filmed in Lebanon. The club was most likely a set created at Pinewood Studios.

The character appeared briefly in the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace, portrayed by uncredited stuntman Derek Lea.
The otherwise unnamed bodyguard was present with the official during a covert meeting of Quantum at an opera house in Bregenz, Austria. James Bond identifies Haines as one of Quantum's members and chases after the bodyguard, believing him to be associated with Quantum. Following a shoot-out, Bond corners him on top of the building and throws him off the roof. His fall is broke by the hood of Dominic Greene's car. He is shot by Greene's driver on Dominic's orders, presumably to prevent the man from identifying him as a member of Quantum.

Reaching for his radio, he utters ""Green Four to base-"", then he brings out his gun which is kicked from his hand. The butler engages Necros in hand-to-hand combat with the upper hand, blocking a shot from a rolling pin and thwarting the assassin's use of an electric carving knife by yanking out the knife's plug. Holding him over the oven, Necros forces the butler's face onto the hot grill before having a fist-full of flour thrown into his eyes. Viciously brawling around the room, Necros makes a second attempt with a knife, green four kicks him back and burns Necros’s hand on the active grill, before Necros reaches for a saucepan of boiling water. Green Four narrowly avoids the scalding water before the assassin inflicts a series of strong kicks, eventually resulting in him being knocked out by a blow from a frying pan.

After meeting Janus operative Xenia Onatopp in a Monte Carlo casino, Admiral Farrel is lured back to her yacht, the Manticore, for a night of fun. In the next scene the two are having sex. Xenia snogs him passionately and then Onatopp wraps her legs around his chest and proceeds to crush him to death between her thighs. Farrell's last words are ""Xenia, I can't breathe!"" shortly before he dies from lack of oxygen. The following morning, as Onatopp and her accomplice use the man's ID card to steal a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter, James Bond is trying to get information about Onatopp by snooping on the yacht. Bond is momentarily taken aback when he sees a naked man on the yacht who then falls forward. Bond then realizes that is the corpse of Admiral Farrel with rigor mortis having taken place in his body and he still retains a grin from the revelry of the previous night's promiscuity.

He has M report about the police shooting incident in his office, and persuades her to regain control over Bond. Apparently, he is very keen to maintain a good relationship with the United States, so he forbids MI6 to further investigate against Dominic Greene. The Foreign Secretary is not to happy about it either, but he sees this as a necessary step to compete with the big players on the oil market, as the Americans still think that oil is the motive for Greene's actions.
After the talk with M, he does not appear again.

As they sit in traffic Bond improvises a distraction by knocking an intoxicated reveler's liquor over the car's interior and igniting it with Volpe's cigarette lighter. He flees the burning vehicle into the Junkanoo crowds, pursued by Volpe and her men. Shot in the ankle, Bond inadvertently leaves a blood trail which leads them to the Kiss Kiss Club, where 007 attempts to mix in with the dancers.
Volpe approaches Bond as he is dancing with another woman. Assuming Volpe is his wife, the woman abruptly leaves, and the pair begin slow-dancing. As they dance another henchmen takes aim at Bond from behind a nearby curtain. Bond notices in time and spins Volpe into the path of the bullet, piercing her spine and killing her instantly. Her henchman flee and 007 drops Volpe's corpse into a nearby chair, quipping to the couple sitting at the table ""mind if my friend sits this one out? She's just dead.""
During the driving sequence, Fiona Volpe was dubbed by stuntman Bill Ivy.

789,/wiki/007_in_New_York,"Octopussy and The Living Daylights is a collection of James Bond short stories by Ian Fleming, published posthumously in the United Kingdom and the United States by Glidrose Productions, in 1966, as a postscript to his James Bond canon.
Before his death, Ian Fleming reportedly had intended to compile a second book of short stories in the same vein as For Your Eyes Only. After his death, Glidrose Productions followed this plan.
Initially, the book contained only two short stories: (i) The final James Bond short story to be published, ""Octopussy"" (with agent 007 in a minor role), which was first serialized in the March and April 1966 issues of Playboy magazine, some two years after Ian Fleming's death; and (ii) ""The Living Daylights"", considered by critics to be the best James Bond short story, which was first published in the 1962 magazine supplement to The Times newspaper (the story also appeared under the title ""Berlin Escape"", in the June 1962 issue of Argosy magazine).
When the first paperback edition of the collection was published in 1967, it was expanded with a third short story, ""The Property of a Lady"", which Fleming wrote, in 1963, for inclusion in The Ivory Hammer, the annual publication of Sotheby's auction house. In the second edition, the collection's title was shortened to Octopussy; most paperback reprints of the 1970s and 1980s used the abbreviated title. The third edition of the collection appeared in 2002, expanded with a fourth short story, ""007 in New York"". Originally titled ""Reflections in a Carey Cadillac"", it was however first published under the name ""Agent 007 in New York"" in the New York Herald Tribune in October 1963. In 1964 it was retitled simply ""007 in New York"" when published in the American edition of Thrilling Cities. The short story was written as a consolation to readers in New York City due to Fleming's grim opinion of the city. The story was not published in Britain until the late 1990s.
Editions of the collection published since the mid-1990s have used the original full title, Octopussy and the Living Daylights.
It is not known for certain whether any of these stories were ever actually earmarked by Ian Fleming for his never-completed collection, though it is likely ""The Living Daylights"", at the very least, would have been a strong contender since it (unlike the others) had already been widely published by 1964. In addition, Fleming's final novel, The Man with the Golden Gun, referred to the events of ""The Property of a Lady"", despite the story only having had limited release prior to the novel's publication.
""Octopussy"" provided the title of the eponymous 1983 film, and the background for the movie character Octopussy, the daughter of the villain in the short story; the film also used most of the plot of ""The Property of a Lady"". In 1987, ""The Living Daylights"" was closely adapted for the first act of Timothy Dalton's eponymous first James Bond film of the same title. According to some sources, such as The Bond Files by Andy Lane and Paul Simpson, The Property of A Lady was under consideration as the title of Dalton's third James Bond film to be released in 1991, but it went unfilmed; little of the original short story would have been available for use, given it having been used in the Octopussy film. As for ""007 in New York"", some aficionados feel that, though unfilmed, the story's spirit is in the New York City segment of the 1973 film Live and Let Die. A likely more direct reference, however, is the closing sequence of Quantum of Solace which depicts Bond on a mission to warn a Canadian agent that her boyfriend is an enemy, paralleling Bond's mission in ""007 in New York""; in addition, the character name Solange from the short story was given to a character in the 2006 Casino Royale film.
Several stories within the collection have been republished in other formats. In 2008, the four stories, along with those in For Your Eyes Only, were compiled in the Penguin Classics release Quantum of Solace: The Complete James Bond Short Stories, released as a tie-in with the film. In 2011, Penguin Modern Classics paired ""The Living Daylights"" with ""From a View to a Kill"" (from For Your Eyes Only) in a small compilation titled The Living Daylights.
At the start of You Only Live Twice, Bond complains about the meaningless assignments he had undertaken since the death of his wife, Tracy, at the end of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. It has been suggested that the stories in this collection may well have taken place during this dark period of Bond's career; the mention of Mary Goodnight in ""The Property of a Lady"" implies that that story at least takes place after On Her Majesty's Secret Service, where the character was introduced. The same story also introduces Maria Freudenstein, who is later said to have been killed in The Man with the Golden Gun, indicating it is set before that novel at the very least.
Over 15 years later, the officer's body fell out of a glacier where Smythe had dumped it. MI6 opened an investigation, and Bond took the case as the officer was a friend who taught him to ski in his teens. Bond leaves after hearing the story and implies that the authorities will arrest Smythe in due course after he writes a report. While he considers what to do, Smythe is pricked on the torso by a poisonous scorpion fish and, on the verge of death, is pulled under the water by his pet octopus. The death is reported in the local papers as an accidental drowning, and Bond officially classifies it as such even though he suspects that had the truth been revealed that Smythe commited suicide, the latter's reputation would have been ruined.
An unusually morose James Bond is assigned sniper duty to help a defector known as ""272"" escape East Berlin. Bond's duty is to prevent a top KGB assassin codenamed ""Trigger"" from killing 272 by eliminating the sniper. However, the assignment becomes difficult when Bond discovers that Trigger is a beautiful female cellist whom he had earlier admired. Bond, never wishing to kill anyone in cold blood, decides to instead shoot the butt of her rifle, preventing her from making the kill. The mission, while successful, is also considered a failure due to Bond's last second decision, and it ends with Bond hoping that M will strip him of his 00 number for it.
James Bond is having a very uneventful day at the Ministry of Defence headquarters when M calls him in to his office to meet a Dr. Fanshawe. M explains that Fanshawe is an expert on antique jewelry and also an advisor to H.M. Customs and the CID on this subject.
Dr. Fanshawe now explains that H.M. Customs recently intercepted a parcel in the registered mail which contained a rare Fabergé egg with a declared value of £100,000. A Home Office warrant was obtained and the package clandestinely opened. Inside was the famous Emerald Sphere by Fabérgé and papers, in Russian and French, stating the provenance of the piece. The parcel was addressed to a Miss Maria Freudenstein, and according to the provenance, she has inherited the Sphere from her grandfather.
Bond investigates Freudenstein, who is a double agent about to be paid by her Russian keepers by auctioning the Fabergé egg at Sotheby's in her name. The Russians have sent the Resident Director of the KGB in London to attend the auction and underbid for the item in order to push the price to the necessary value to pay for her services as a double agent. Bond attends the auction in hopes of spotting this man; after doing so the man is expelled from London as persona non grata.
Maria Freudenstein was hired by the British Secret Service with prior knowledge that she was a double agent. She is essentially tasked with sending phony SITREPS to Washington, D.C., which she copies and sends to Moscow unknowning that they are fake. Her unpleasant fate is revealed in Fleming's novel The Man with the Golden Gun, though as it happened most readers did not get to see this story, in which she first appeared, until several years after the novel came out.
The short story also includes Kenneth Snowman as an ally of Bond. Snowman, in reality, was a master jeweler and one of the leading experts on Carl Fabergé. ""The Property of a Lady"" features a number of notes on the items for auction, one of which references a book by Kenneth Snowman.
The story ""007 in New York"" is an inconsequential tale in which Bond muses about New York City, and his favorite recipe for scrambled eggs from Loelia Ponsonby. Bond, traveling as David Barlow, is going through customs and immigration at New York's Idlewild airport. He has flown in on BAOC's Monarch flight from London and estimates that the FBI or the CIA will not detect him in the twenty-four hours he will be spending in New York. His mission is to warn a female MI6 employee who used to be a first class staff officer for the Secret Service, that the American authorities are getting close to finding out that she is cohabiting with a KGB agent. The agent is attached to the UN and M is sending Bond to tell her that the CIA is close to identifying her.

Two of Fleming's short stories were adapted as daily James Bond comic strips which were published in the British Daily Express newspaper and syndicated worldwide.
Both comic strips were reprinted by Titan Books in the early 1990s, and again in 2004. To date, ""The Property of a Lady"" and ""007 in New York"" have not been adapted as comic strips. Along with ""Quantum of Solace"" from For Your Eyes Only, these remain the only Ian Fleming Bond stories not yet adapted in this form.

790,/wiki/Charlie_(Joe_Chitwood),"Charlie is the driver who picks James Bond up after he has arrived in New York. He also works as an undercover agent for the CIA. On FDR Drive, the assassin known as Whisper driving a white Corvorado fires a metal dart from the wing mirror into Charlie's temple, killing him. This causes Charlie's foot to stomp on the accelerator trapping Bond in the speeding car. Bond manages to get the car to stop by swerving it into a nearby car. Later as the police examine his body, Bond, using one of the officers' phones, informs Felix Leiter of Charlie's death.
"
791,/wiki/Dr._Kaufman_(Vincent_Schiavelli),"Dr. Kaufman was a fictional professional assassin and German scientist in the employ of media mogul, Elliot Carver. A supporting antagonist portrayed by the late American actor, Vincent Schiavelli, the character first appeared in the 1997 James Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies, was subsequently adapted in Raymond Benson's accompanying novelization as well in 1999 video game adaptation of the film, voiced by Zimbabwean actor Miles Anderson.
A professor of forensic medicine, Kaufman is hired by Media mogul Elliot Carver after he learns about the relationship between James Bond and Carver's wife Paris. After first murdering Paris, Kaufman waits for Bond in his hotel room; intending to kill Bond in such a manner as to make Paris's death appear a murder-suicide. Confronting Bond at gunpoint, he brags about his professionalism and how his services as an assassin are in demand all over the world. Of all the methods at his disposal, apparently his specialty is the celebrity overdose.
Fortunately for Bond, Kaufman's attempt to shoot the MI6 agent is suddenly interrupted by a phone call from his protégé, Richard Stamper. Stamper and his men are attempting to break into Bond's BMW 750iL to retrieve the GPS encoder he had stolen back from them earlier in the film. They are, however, having difficulty bypassing the car's security system. In desperation, Stamper asks Kaufman to make Bond disable the vehicle's security.
Providing Kaufman with his mobile phone - the car's remote control device - 007 tricks him into activating the phone's taser feature, shocking him and giving Bond the opportunity to gain the upper hand. His own weapon now pointing at him, the assassin protests that he is merely a professional doing his job, but Bond simply replies that he is too and pulls the trigger and shoots Kaufman in the head killing him.
The novelisation has Bond reflecting that Kaufman's death is one of the rare occasions where he has killed someone whom he knew unquestionably deserved to die.

793,/wiki/Baines,"Baines is an MI6 agent in the 1973 film Live and Let Die. He was portrayed by Dennis Edwards.
The last part of the pre-title sequence of the movie shows the ritualistic murder of MI6 agent Baines in San Monique. Highly influenced by voodoo, Baines has blood thrown at him, and is then bitten by a poisonous snake, dying instantly.

794,/wiki/Doubleshot,"Doubleshot, first published in 2000, was the sixth novel by Raymond Benson featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond (including film novelizations). Carrying the Ian Fleming Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam.
Doubleshot, the second novel in Raymond Benson's Union trilogy, again sets James Bond, 007 against the evil terrorist organization called the Union. Still smarting from their last encounter with 007 when he foiled their plans to get Skin 17 in High Time to Kill, the Union has decided that Britain and James Bond are their new number one priority, and targets. Coming up with an elaborate plan to plunge Britain into war and destroy Bond's reputation in the process, the Union sets up their scheme. Domingo Espada, a Spanish Nationalist/Gangster/Ex-Matador who wishes to see Gibraltar returned to Spain from Britain, is approched by Nadir Yassasin, the Union's master strategist, as the centerpiece to their plan. They plan to help Espada forcefully take control of Gibraltar, killing the British Prime Minister and the Govenor of Gibraltar, and having a Bond-Double do it, thus ruining Bond's career and life.
But first, through an elaborate series of events, they convince Bond he is losing his mind, and force him to investigate these happenings on his own, without approval from M or SIS. Since Bond's return from the Himalayas, he begins experiencing terrible headaches, hallucinations, and black-outs. This leads him to Dr. Kimberly Feare. She diagnoses a lesion on the back of Bond's skull that is causing these symptoms. After getting Dr. Feare in bed, Bond wakes up to find her murdered, her throat slit ear-to-ear, the Union's mark. This causes Bond to leave England. Bond's trek takes him from England to Tangier, where he encounters the Taunt Twins, Heidi and Hedi, CIA agents asked by M to bring him back to London. Here Bond finds the connection between the Union and Espada, and that he has some part in the Union's plan. Convincing M, and the Taunts, to play out his hand, Bond goes to Spain. 
On arrival in Spain, he encounters Margareta Piel, Espada's female assassin and a member of the Union. Followed closely by the climax of Bond vs. his Double in Espada's practice bullfighting ring, and the cumination of the Union's plot at the Gibraltar peace conference, Bond takes his double's place and along with the Taunt twins, prevent the assassinations, kills Espada, Piel, Jimmy Powers (a high-ranking American in the Union, and their number one expert in stealth and tailing), and captures Yassasin, foiling the Union's plans once again.
"
795,/wiki/Honey_Ryder_(Ursula_Andress),"Honey Ryder is a fictional shell-diver and love interest of James Bond. Based on the character Honeychile Rider from the 1958 Ian Fleming novel, Dr. No, the Bond girl appeared in the 1962 James Bond film of the same name, portrayed by Swiss-American actress, Ursula Andress, but voiced by the late German actress, Nikki van der Zyl, due to Andress' Swiss-German accent. Honey was subsequently re-imagined for the 2015 mobile game, James Bond: World of Espionage. The first main Bond girl in the EON Productions film series, she was also one of the most popular.
Having drawn a link between the murder of fellow British spy, John Strangways, and radioactive samples he had taken from an island named Crab Key in Jamaica (owned by the reclusive criminal operative, Dr. Julius No) James Bond convinces his ally Quarrel to take him there by boat. There Bond meets the beautiful Honey Ryder, dressed only in a white bikini, who is collecting shells and singing ""Under the Mango Tree"". She emerges from the sea and Bond finds her to be beautiful right away, scaring her by joining in singing. At first she is suspicious of Bond but soon decides to help him after Dr. No's guards destroy her boat. Honey shows Quarrel and Bond a way to evade the henchmen when caught. After they escape, she tells Bond how her father died when on Crab Key, after which she was raped by a local landlord. Honey relates how she got her revenge by putting a black widow spider in his mosquito net and causing his lingering death. This shows a very deadly side to her, though she maintains a look of innocence and naivety.
After nightfall they are attacked by the legendary ""dragon"" of Crab Key, which turns out to be an armoured tractor equipped with a flamethrower. In the resulting gun battle, Quarrel is incinerated whilst Bond and Honey are taken prisoner. They are decontaminated, quartered in Dr. No's lair, and given drugged coffee to render them unconscious. They dress and meet Dr. No in his office, where he invites them to lunch. After dinner, Ryder is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards. Later, after killing Dr. No and sabotaging the island's reactor, Bond rescues Honey from being slowly drowned. As the complex explodes, the pair escape by boat until they run out of gas in the middle of the sea, and start kissing.
As in the novel, Honey is a very independent woman claiming to not need help from anyone. She is a  beachcomber making a living selling seashells in Miami. Resourceful and courageous, she states that she can defend herself against any hostile when she first meets Bond. Although she is at first wary of Bond, he is allowed to get closer when he comments that his intentions are honourable.
In the film series, Honey is widely regarded as the first Bond girl, although she is not the first woman in the film to be with Bond (that distinction belongs to Sylvia Trench, while Miss Taro was Bond's first mission-related ""conquest""). Her entrance in the film, emerging from the ocean in a white bikini with hunting knife belt around her waist, striding barefoot over the wet beach sand, carrying large seashells whilst taking off her diving mask as while the sun shines on her wet blonde hair while she is singing ""Underneath the Mango Tree"", is considered a classic James Bond moment and is one of the most popular scenes in cinematic history. This scene was also only the second time an actress had worn a bikini on screen after and God created Woman, but this movie is given the credit for single-handedly making the bikini as popular as it is today. As a homage, costume designer Linda Hemming made a similar costume of a La Perla bikini and patterned Ghost sarong as an outfit for Izabella Scorupco's character Natalya Simonova in the 17th James Bond film GoldenEye and Halle Berry performed a similar scene to Ursula's in an orange bikini in the 20th James Bond film, Die Another Day. Mariah Carey also references this scene in the music video for her song ""Honey"".
The character was later mentioned by name in On Her Majesty's Secret Service as a ""beautiful movie star."" Andress is the first of only two entertainers that have actually starred in a Bond film to be mentioned by Ian Fleming in his James Bond novels. The other is David Niven who co-starred as James Bond in the 1967 film adaptation of Casino Royale along with Andress.
The film changed quite a few points in the novel, one of which being Honey's outfit, or rather lack thereof. In the original novel, Honey emerges from the water naked, wearing only the belt. When she notices that Bond is watching her, she covers her face to hide her identity. Understandably Honey was given a bikini in the film, and isn't ashamed when she sees Bond. Due to the films taking place during the present day of the films and not the books, the bikini had been around long enough to include.

797,/wiki/Blofeld_(Hollis/Rietty),"Initially a partially unseen character portrayed by Anthony Dawson and Eric Pohlmann (Voice), Blofeld was subsequently played on screen by Donald Pleasence, Telly Savalas and Charles Gray. A final depiction of the character (unnamed for copyright reasons) appeared in the pre-title sequence of For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by John Hollis and voiced by Robert Rietty. Following years of litigation over the ownership of the character, Blofeld was later re-invented for the Daniel Craig continuity of James Bond films (2006-2021), portrayed by Christoph Waltz.
Arriving at an isolated part of the base, Blofeld activates the base's self destruct system before fleeing. Although Blofeld escaped, Bond managed to destroy the rocket remotely before it could capture more astronauts.
Now the subject of an international man-hunt by the British Secret Service titled Operation Bedlam, Blofeld establishes a clinical allergy-research institute atop Piz Gloria in the Swiss Alps. James Bond investigates the office of Swiss lawyer Gumbold, and learns that Blofeld is corresponding with London College of Arms' genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, attempting to claim the aristocratic title ""Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp"". He ventures to Switzerland posing as Bray to gather intelligence on Blofeld, who has went to the lengths of having his earlobes surgically removed to back-up his claims of nobility. There he learns that Blofeld secretly plans to contaminate and ultimately sterilize the world's food supply using biological warfare, carried by his brainwashed Angels of Death. Blofeld claimed he would not carry out his plan if all his past crimes were pardoned and he is recognised as the current Count de Bleauchamp. Bond tries to trick Blofeld into leaving Switzerland so that MI6 can arrest him without violating Swiss sovereignty. Blofeld refuses and Bond is eventually caught by henchwoman Irma Bunt. Blofeld reveals that he identified Bond after his attempt to lure him out of Switzerland, and tells his men to take the agent away. Bond eventually makes his escape by skiing down Piz Gloria while Blofeld and his men give chase.
Aided by his future wife, Tracy, the next morning their flight resumes. However, they are intercepted by Blofeld, who sets off an avalanche; resulting in Tracy's capture, while Bond is buried but manages to escape. M tells 007 that Blofeld's ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. Bond then enlists Marc-Ange Draco and his Unione Corse forces to attack Piz Gloria, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a bobsleigh, with Bond pursuing him. The chase ends when Blofeld becomes snared in a tree branch, ripping him out of the bobsled and apparently killing him. Subsequently, Bond and Tracy marry in Portugal and pull over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car. As they converse, Blofeld (wearing a neck brace) and Bunt commit a drive-by shooting of the couple's car - with Blofeld driving, and Bunt firing the gun. Bond survives, but Tracy is killed in the attack.
Following the pipeline trail, 007 breaks into Willard Whyte's penthouse apartment only to be unexpectedly confronted with two identical Blofelds (who uses an electronic device to sound like Whyte). Bond kills one of the Blofelds, but he turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, where he is picked up by Blofeld's assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd and taken out to Las Vegas Valley where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. Bond escapes and calls Blofeld posing as his right-hand man, Bert Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and rescues him, but in the meantime Blofeld retreats to his oil platform off the coast of Baja California. In the process of escaping he abducts Bond's smuggler ally, Tiffany Case. With the satellite now in orbit, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, then proposes an international auction. Bond travels to the oil platform and is captured in an attempt to sabotage the weapon. Shortly afterwards Felix Leiter and the CIA begin a helicopter attack on the rig. In the ensuing chaos Blofeld attempts to escape using a midget submarine, but Bond gains control of the submarine's launch crane and crashes the sub into the control room, causing both the satellite control and the base to be destroyed.
Blofeld evidently survived the attack and resurfaced years later (dialogue in Marvel's comic adaptation would suggest 10 years after their last encounter) with a plan to exact revenge on his old adversary, James Bond, for foiling his plans and causing the downfall of his criminal organisation. Now wheelchair-bound, bald and wearing a neck-brace, Blofeld rigs a ""Universal Exports""-emblazoned Bell 206 helicopter with remote control hardware and remotely electrocutes the pilot after he collects 007. Taking control of the aircraft over a London gasworks, Blofeld toys with Bond before attempting to crash the flying death-trap in a warehouse. However, 007 regains control of the aircraft and impales Blofeld's wheelchair on its landing gear, lifting the villain into the skies. After toying with his nemesis, Bond drops the pleading Blofeld down a tall industrial chimney stack, killing him from the impact, avenging Tracy's death.
Ernst Stavro Blofeld's personality, in its authoritarian and inhuman megalomania, fits perfectly in the line of such infamous historical names as Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler or Stalin. Despite his absolutely ruthless character, he possessed an exceptionally calm and calculating mind, always acting in a thoughtful manner and leaving nothing to chance.
Although Blofeld was more of a strategist and a master thinker in the background, he was not afraid to personally intervene in the battle if necessary. However, he was most courageous when surrounded by a sufficiently large armed bodyguard, otherwise he cultivated a rather defensive fighting style, whose main goal was his safe escape. He also was a self-concerned megalomaniac who only cared about results, profit, power, and world domination, no matter how many henchmen he needs to sacrifice or innocent lives need to be lost in the process.
Even with several other Bond villains with massive attempted body counts, Blofeld’s plots were easily among the worst and most destructive in the franchise, having threatened millions of innocent lives and planned widespread, irreparable destruction, all stemming from megalomania and other purely selfish reasons without the faintest notion of good intentions.
Although not present in the novel, Blofeld makes his first on-screen appearance in From Russia with Love, portrayed by Anthony Dawson and voiced by Eric Pohlmann. Both men remained uncredited, the end credits listed a question mark instead of an actor’s name. In this appearance his face is not seen and only his lower body is visible as he strokes his trademark white cat, discussing a plan to avenge the death of their member Doctor Julius No by setting a trap that will put Bond and Russian agent Tatiana Romanova in a position where it will appear that they killed each other while escaping to escalate tensions in the Cold War. After being absent from Goldfinger, Blofeld returned in Thunderball.
Right before Blofeld is killed, he begs to Bond to spare him, and cryptically bribes him with a delicatessen in stainless steel. This line had been added in by the producer of the film, Albert R. Broccoli, as a throwback to Mafia slang for a very cushy bribe used during the time and place he was growing up in (as at the time, having a delicatessen in stainless steel was considered luxurious especially if the owner was a street vendor).
The classic depiction of Blofeld has appeared in a number of James Bond video games as a playable multiplayer character. His first appearance was in the 2004 first-person shooter video game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, developed by EA LA and published by Electronic Arts. During its development official footage of character renders released by the publisher featured the terrorist leader 'Number One' holding his Persian Cat, with the likeness of Donald Pleasence. Likely due to legalities, in the final product the character's face is obscured, shot from behind and from the neck downwards. Number 1 was voiced by actor Gideon Emery using a similar intonation to Pleasence's portrayal of the character.

798,/wiki/Colonel_Fu_San_Ping,"Suspecting that a third party was manipulating events to kill Stefan Pomerov, James Bond examines the Turkish courier's phone which had led him to the Russian industrialist. Beside several local phone calls, Bond observed that Bernin had received an unanswered international call before he died. Phoning the number, 007 discovers that Colonel Fu San Ping, an influential Chinese agent, had been attempting to contact the courier. Ping suggests an alliance and meets with Bond at an aquarium in Bangkok, Thailand.  At the aquarium, Ping asks Bond to complete one simple task before meeting in person: find and disable three audio surveillance bugs in the aquarium.  After Bond does so and meets with Ping at the whale exhibit, Ping reveals that an economic mercenary has been stealing dangerous technological secrets and selling them to the highest bidder. Related to this, he had a team in Geneva following a lead on a man called Rak who operates out of Bangkok. Before Ping can reveal more, an assassin kills him with a single bullet to the head.
In the Nintendo DS version of Blood Stone, the aquarium where Bond and Ping meet is a one-story building comprising of ten exhibits, with each one dedicated to a certain marine animal and connected by short tunnels.  The task that Ping asks Bond to complete to meet safely is to have him find and photograph secret fragments of a picture of a shark found on the glass of different tanks in the exhibits, which Bond puts together to determine that Ping is in the shark exhibit, where the two have their fateful meeting as usual.
At one point in the game, he is incorrectly referred to as ""General Ping"" when the objective prompts Bond to meet him at the aquarium after deactivating the bugs planted across the location. This is likely a leftover from an earlier incarnation of the game in which Ping was supposedly depicted as an older man than he was in the final form of the title.

801,/wiki/Dr._Kananga_(Yaphet_Kotto),"PoliticianDr. Kananga, also known as Mr. Big, was the main antagonist in the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die and was portrayed by American actor Yaphet Kotto.
Drug baron and dictator of a fictitious Caribbean island named San Monique, Kananga is loosely based on the main villain of Ian Fleming's second James Bond novel, Live and Let Die. Like his novel counterpart, Kananga adopts the alias ""Mr. Big"" to conduct his illicit activities, however the difference of novel and film versions of the character are radically different to the point of being completely different people.
Dr. Kananga, operating under the alias ""Mr. Big"", is a businessman and owner of a chain of restaurants in New York City and New Orleans called ""Fillet of Soul"". As Big, he is also the head of one of the most vicious street gangs in Harlem. Kananga is the de facto dictator of the fictional Caribbean island of San Monique and thus has certain diplomatic immunities in the United States easily allowing him to smuggle drugs into the country.
Kananga grows vast quantities of opium in San Monique's poppy fields under the protection of large camouflage nets and guarded by the mystical Baron Samedi. Using the poppies, Kananga hopes to flood the U.S. market with two tonnes of heroin distributed through his legitimate restaurants free of charge, thus forcing other drug dealers out of business. In doing so, he believes that he would double the amount of addicts, which he would be able to exploit with his newfound monopoly.
Kananga attracts the attention of the Secret Intelligence Service when three British agents are killed in the space of twenty-four hours while investigating his business. One agent (Dawes) is killed during a UN meeting at which Kananga and Solitaire are present, another (Hamilton) in New Orleans by the brass band and the last (Baines) is murdered by Dambala, a member of Kananga's voodoo cult on San Monique.
MI6 assigns one of its best agents, James Bond, to investigate the tyrant and his connection with the murders. The agent 007 travels to New York, where Kananga is supposed to arrive later, at the San Monique embassy. However, the villain is warned about Bond's arrival and intentions by the medium Solitaire. To get rid of Bond, he sends his minion Whisper, who shoots Charlie, the driver of Bond's car while on the Rockfeller Expressway. Charlie, now dead from a poison dart, slumps over in his seat and his foot puts its full weight on the gas, causing the car to accelerate rapidly and possibly careen off the expressway. However, Bond grabs the wheel and pulls the emergency brake.
Kananga, who has left the UN and returned to the embassy, knows that he is being watched and that his office is most likely bugged. To deceive the CIA, he starts playing a pre-recorded tape in which he dictates a long, nationalistic letter. He and his associates (Solitaire, Tee Hee and Whisper) then change clothes and leave the embassy through a hidden exit in his office. Thinking that Kananga is still in his office, Felix Leiter calls his friend Bond and tells him to go after Whisper instead. Local police found that the car Whisper was driving when murdering Charlie was registered to the O. Cult Voodoo Shop. Following Whisper in a parking garage, Bond is disturbed by the arrival of Kananga and his henchmen, who enter a car and leave, pursued by Bond.
Bond follows the car in a cab, unaware that Kananga's spies inform their boss about Bond's every move. Arriving at Harlem, Bond sees Kananga's car before the Fillet of Soul restaurant and enters. The taxi driver, also a spy of Kananga, informs his boss that Bond is coming.
In the restaurant, Bond is seated at a table at the wall. While waiting for his drink, Bond tries to bribe the waiter for information but the wall and the table spin, bringing Bond into a secret room. There, three armed henchmen await him, telling him that Mr. Big will ""take care"" of him soon. Bond briefly talks to Solitaire, before Tee Hee arrives and asks the medium whether Bond is armed. Solitaire looks into the cards and confirms this, and Tee Hee disarms Bond with the metal claw he has as his right hand; he uses his artificial appendage to flatten the barrel of Bond's gun.
007 is then brought before their leader. Mr. Big asks Solitaire whether Bond is the one who tailed them from uptown. Bond tries to introduce himself but Big only looks at him briefly and then tells his men to bring Bond outside and kill him. He then leaves the room.
Two of Kananga's henchmen then bring Bond in an abandoned sidealley, where the British agent quickly takes them out. Another black man then arrives, holding his gun at Bond, but the man turns out to be a CIA agent named Harold Strutter. Both men, together with Felix Leiter (who is communicating via a radio in Strutter's car), then wonder how Kananga and Mr. Big fit together. Telling the agents that Kananga is about to leave the USA and return to San Monique, Leiter sends Bond after him.
Knowing that Bond has arrived at San Monique, Kananga sends Whisper, a poisoned snake, and CIA double agent Rosie Carver after Bond, who kills the snake by igniting his deoderant with his cigar and burning it. Due to a warning sent by Solitaire, Bond realises that Rosie is false and he is also able to kill the snake. The next day, Bond and Rosie set out to travel to the point where Baines was killed. Again, Kananga is warned by Solitaire, who he has confined to a isolated palace, about Bond's arrival on the island. He then asks Solitaire about the future. When she draws the card ""The Lovers"", a card Bond drew on their earlier meeting, Solitaire pauses for a moment. Kananga realises this and asks her whether the card meant death. Solitaire goes with the lie and confirms this. Kananga then calls his henchmen, telling them to prepare and that Rosie knows what to do.
Eventually confronting Rosie, Bond reveals that he knows she works for Kananga. Holding her at gunpoint, he tries to force her to give up information. However, when Rosie sees a voodoo totem, she is deeply afraid although Bond believes it to be an act. Rather risking Bond than Kananga, Rosie tries to run off. However, she is shot by a gun hidden inside the mouth of one of the totems on Kananga's orders. After Rosie's death, Kananga travels to Solitaire's palace to find out what went wrong. Telling her that the trap was set and that she saw death, he asks her how Bond could survive. Solitaire tells him that the death she saw must have been Rosie's and that she cannot be held responsible for Kananga's misinterpretations if he fails to ask specific questions. Kananga tells her that her growing impertinence disturbs him. He reminds her what happened to her mother when she lost her power and became useless. He then asks where Bond is now, but Solitaire can't answer him. She tells him that she cannot see when he treats her like that, as thing become unclear. He confines her to her chambers, telling her that she made him angry and he does not want to be. After Solitaire is gone, he talks to Tee Hee.
At the night, Bond infiltrates Solitaire's palace and seduces her. By sleeping with her, she loses her power and becomes useless for Kananga.
When Solitaire is about to bring Bond to Kananga's heroin field, which is protected by large camouflage nets, Kananga is warned. He tells his men to kill Bond if he finds the field, but Bond is able to escape all pursuers. Now aware that Kananga is smuggling heroin, Bond travells to New Orleans because Hamilton was killed there. However, while in a taxi, they are kidnapped by the driver, who is the same one as in New York. He brings them to an airfield, telling them that Mr. Big wants to see him because he stole something from a friend of Big. However, Bond is able to defeat Kananga's men and returns to Felix Leiter. Solitaire, however, is left behind, and returns to possession of Kananga.
In New Orleans, Leiter and Bond enter the Fillet of Souls, unaware that Strutter (they were supposed to meet there) had been killed by the same assassin that killed Hamilton. Remembering his last adventure in the Harlem restaurant of the Fillet of Soul chain, Bond decides against a table at the wall, instead choosing one in the middle of the room, right up at the front of the stage. Felix is then called away by the restaurant's maître d′, under the pretext of a phone call from Strutter, and Bond, along with the table and chairs, is lowered into the ground, having once again become a victim of Kananga's trap doors.
Bond lands in a room in which he is greeted by Tee Hee, Mr. Big and Solitaire, and finds himself secured to a chair by Tee Hee. Big tells him that by taking Solitaire with him, Bond stole something extremely valuable from his ""good friend"" Kananga. Big then tells Bond that while he has plans with Bond, there is, firstly, a question he needs to answer for Kananga. Bond replies that, for the question to be answered, Big had to ship him back to San Monique, as Bond wouldn't answer to lackeys. Though Big angrily asks Bond whether he touched Solitaire, Bond states that he will answer this question only to Kananga, intending to buy time.
However, Big rips his own face off, revealing that it was only a latex mask, and that he himself is Kananga. This causes Bond to seemingly finally realise Kananga's plan: Kananga grows heroin on San Monique and sells it as Mr. Big, thereby making the full profit. However, Kananga laughs, telling him that he wouldn't sell heroin for money. Bond remarks sarcastically that Kananga surely would just give it away, but Kananga confirms that this is exactly what he is intending: a underworld version of ""dumping"" (undercutting prices). He agrees that Bond was correct about Fillet of Soul being a front business and the distribution points for his heroin racket; ""anyone is welcome, black or white, male or female"". By distributing two tons of free heroin, he plans to drive every major drug dealer in the United States (particularly the crime families) out of business, and likely doubling, if not trebling or more, the amount of addicts. By driving up the price of the heroin after securing this monopoly, he intends to make a fortune. Kananga snidely adds that after the plan is done to fruition: ""the only monopolies in America will be me and the post office!""
After having revealed his plan, he comes back to his initial question, whether Bond slept with Solitaire. When Bond refuses to answer out of gentlemanliness, Kananga intends to find out another way. He has Tee Hee take off Bond's watch, which Tee Hee then brings to Kananga. Bond thinks to himself how Kananga could have found out about the watch's abilities from Q Branch. Kananga then tells Tee Hee to snip off the little finger on Bond's right hand on Solitaire's first wrong answer, proceeding to ""more vital organs"" with every subsequent wrong answer. However, Kananga has no knowledge that this watch was invented by Q, simply seeing it as an ordinary man's wristwatch. He then reads a registration number off the back of Bond's watch and asks Solitaire whether he spoke the truth. Solitaire, only able to guess, tells Kananga that he spoke the truth, and Kananga tells Tee Hee to let Bond go, letting him out of the restraint chair, even giving him back his watch. However, as soon as Bond puts his watch back on, Tee Hee knocks him out with his metal arm. Whisper, on cue, arrives in the room and is told by Kananga to take Bond to ""the farm"".
After Whisper and Bond are gone, Samedi, wearing more modern-styled clothes, enters the room. Solitaire then asks Kananga when they will go back to San Monique. Kananga tells her that they will go back soon, but then asks Solitaire why she betrayed him, revealing that the number he read was wrong, and he even gave her a fifty-fifty chance. He wants to know why she betrayed him although he gave her everything and she lacked for nothing. She tells him that the cards foresaw it. He angrily smacks her to the ground, telling her that in proper time he would have given her love and that she knew that. He says that there is only one appropriate way to deal with this betrayal, to which Samedi draws the tarot card 'Death'. Building on this, he says there is one proper time for administering this; on cue, Samedi draws the card marked 'Midnight'
He later intends for Solitaire to be executed by Baron Samedi in voodoo fashion on San Monique, mirroring the fate that befell Baines. Solitaire is tied to two posts by her wrists, and Dambala picks a snake from a coffin filled with snakes with which to kill her. The ceremony atendees summon Baron Samedi from one of the graves in the cemetery, and he gives the order for Dambala to move in for the kill. However, Bond, who has infiltrated the island with the aid of Quarrel Jr. after seeing the half-burnt tarot cards spelling Solitaire's fate, kills Dambala and another man who tries to attack him, seemingly kills Samedi and saves Solitaire, after blowing up the heroin fields.
By a hidden elevator used by Samedi built into one of the graves in the church cemetery, Bond and Solitaire enter Kananga's underground base, where the two are quickly captured and brought before Kananga, who, despite Bond's intervention, is celebrating his success. Kananga reveals to Bond that they found his wetsuit on the beach, before the destruction of the fields, and were thereby expecting him. He acknowledges that Bond blew up some of his heroin but reveals that there is more then enough left, as Bond has done only minor harm. He then takes Bond's gun, admitting that he is very intrigued by it. He asks Bond what it does and Bond tells him that it is a shark gun that shoots compressed gas pallets.
Kananga laughs and aims the gun at the sofa Whisper is sitting on, causing the covering on the main body to inflate and eventually explode. Kananga is highly amused, calling the weapon ingenious. He then takes one of the gas pallets, but Bond warns him to not meddle with it, as the air inside is already ""foul enough"". Kananga replies that he never thought Bond would be a a bad loser, stating that he expected that Bond would drink with him on the success on his operation. The agent and the traitor are then tied up and attached to a winch normally used to carry the heroin onto a monorail that takes it to the coast for shipment. Bond, expecting that the winch will be lowered into the water beneath, states that surely there must be a more efficient way of drowning someone. Kananga says that they will hardly have the chance to drown. He then cuts Bond on the arm three times, just enough to draw blood. Whisper then starts lowering the winch into the water and opens a underwater gate, through which sharks enter. With the electromagnetic field in his watch, Bond obtains the gas pellet Kananga played with before. Bond also uses his watch to free himself from the ropes. Jumping down onto the ground, he runs towards Kananga. Whisper tries to warn his master, but due to his whispering voice, Kananga cannot hear him. Bond drops Whisper into one of the air tight metal capsules used to keep the heroin dry, locks him inside, and engages Kananga. During their fight, both men fall into the water. Underwater, Bond forces Kananga to swallow the gas pallet after pulling the pin out, causing Kananga to inflate enormously like a giant balloon and rapidly rise to the cave's ceiling before exploding into pieces, in which Bond would quip that Kananga ""always did have an inflated opinion of himself"".
Dr. Kananga and Baron Samedi appear in 2012 in the video game 007 Legends as two of the multiplayer characters.
As a well-known and respected UN politician, Kananga is a charismatic and authoritarian man. He can know the doings of his antagonists thanks to Solitaire, who is never far from him, but his tyrannical authority and considerable influence make her fear him because he treats her almost like a slave, while considering that her psychic power is only there to serve him, and is even ready to withdraw it if the urge takes him. As such, he was horribly jealous when his valued ally had a relationship with Bond and so tried to eliminate them both in a convoluted manner, demonstrating the high value he places on loyalty and his intolerance of betrayal. Kananga is also willing to use any means imaginable to find out what his enemies are hiding from him and does not hesitate to use torture and intimidation to get what he wants, as was the case during his interrogations with Bond. Furthermore, because of his power, the dictator has an implicit tendency to be convinced of his own superiority, to the point of being arrogant and conceited. He is also determined to seize every opportunity that can further his plans and is alert to loopholes in the system which he tends to use to his advantage.
Kananga's status as an ambassador makes him distinguished and careful in his appearance, usually wearing dark, high-collared suits that fit perfectly with a tie and briefcase in the top pocket of his jacket. He always expresses himself in a polite and formal manner even when he is angry, and may display a jovial, childish and somewhat extravagant mood in certain situations.
As a Grosbonnet, the gangster adopts an entirely different appearance, opting for contrasting but still expensive costumes including leather jackets and bandanas around his neck. His language is also radically more casual and he insults his enemies much more easily while unleashing his anger and aggression more often. These two contrasts in the character's personality make it even harder to believe that he is leading a double life and therefore give him a definite advantage over his enemies.
At thirty-three, the actor Yaphet Kotto, who portrayed Kananga, is the youngest actor to play a main antagonist in a Bond film.

802,/wiki/Carlos_Nikolic,"Weapons manufacturerCarlos Nikolic was the assumed identity of a fictional freelance weapons manufacturer and terrorist. A minor antagonist, the character first appeared in the 2006 James Bond film, Casino Royale, portrayed by Italian actor, Claudio Santamaria, and was later seen in the 2008 video-game, 007: Quantum of Solace.
The terrorist financier Le Chiffre uses a Ugandan warlord's money to short-sell stock in Skyfleet, a promising aerospace company, thus betting the money on the company's failure. After his original bomb-maker is killed by James Bond in Madagascar, Carlos is hired to destroy the company's Skyfleet S570 prototype.
After 007 has killed his boss Alex Dimitrios, the spy notices that the ticket has disappeared and that the bag that was stored in the cloakroom under that ticket has gone. Running outside to be confronted by the mass of people, Bond uses quick thinking to call the person using Dimitrios' phone, since he had sent a text to him already. After identifying the target, Bond follows Carlos to Miami International airport.
At the airport, Bond follows the terrorist who changes into a police uniform. He enters a restricted area just before Bond can stop the entry door from closing. Thinking about it for a few moments, Bond gets an idea that the text sent to Mollaka might spell out the numbers to use on the keypad. Luckily, Bond's guess is right and he makes a hurried pursuit.
In order to distract security staff and remain unchallenged, Carlos activates the sprinkler system as a diversion, and walks out onto the runway. He commandeers a fuel truck and before heading off towards the Skyfleet S570prototype, attaches a small keyring bomb to the underside of the tanker. Bond pursues Carlos on foot, managing to run up some aircraft stairs and jumps on top of the tanker. Carlos tries to dislodge Bond by running the tanker into all sorts of aircraft vehicles, while he tries to get Carlos out of the cabin. As the tanker approaches the Skyfleet S570 prototype, Carlos jumps from the tanker leaving Bond to stop the tanker just before it hits the plane. After Bond is arrested by police, Carlos smugly activates his bomb's detonator. During the fight however, Bond had managed to remove the bomb from the tanker, placing it on Carlos' belt. He realises this too late when he is killed in the resulting explosion.
During the course of the 2008 video-game 007: Quantum of Solace, Bond opens up to Camille Montes about the death of his former love, recounting the events of Casino Royale. The player follows through the plot of Casino Royale, with Bond infiltrating the Science Center to kill Dimitrios and eventually saving Skyfleet from Carlos and an army of terrorists who have hijacked Miami International Airport. The level concludes with a pitched battle inside the S570's hangar. In an introductory cut-scene the character is identified as Carlos Decameron, an unemployed American electrical engineer and a suspected arsonist and weapons manufacturer.
Listed in the film's credits as simply 'Carlos', the character's (presumably fake) surname is 'Nikolic' according to his police uniform ID tag. The name may be an in-joke reference to set dressing department coordinator Marija Nikolic who notably worked in Casino Royale's Costume and Wardrobe Department.

He is an operative agent who made three missions with one of the other three operative agents. The First mission is in an isolated area in Tunisia near the Gulf of Gabes. And the mission is to investigate an individual know only as M. Sappho. First the two agents found the entrance to the secret palace, than defused all explosives in M. Sappho's palace.

804,/wiki/Fiona_Kelley,"Noted for her manic personality, she is skilled in deception, stealth and firearms, and is multi-lingual, speaking English, Irish, Italian and French. The character offers a buff to Finishing Move thresholds in Conflicts and provides a +10 total defence bonus using plastic guns and a 2% chance to spend zero energy in Missions using cocktail dresses. She is an 'uncommon agent' (green) and can be levelled to level 15.
Based on the redheaded femme fatale character ""Fiona Kelly"" from writer Richard Maibaum's original screenplay for EON Productions' 1965 James Bond film Thunderball, Fiona Kelley borrows heavily from multiple sources inside and outside the official 007 franchise. A scene where Bond is caught with Caviar and Bollinger RD in his luggage, items which are forbidden at the Shrublands spa, seems to owe its existence to a similar scene in the unofficial 1983 film Never Say Never Again. During her final confrontation with 007, Kelley utters ""You wouldn't shoot me! You'd miss me."", a line belonging to Sophie Marceau's Elektra King, taken directly from the 1999 film The World Is Not Enough.

The decryptor is a standard personal digital assistant (PDA), modified by Q into a custom wireless data unlocking device, powerful enough to overcome electronic locks and unlock high-security areas. The gadget effectively replaces the decryptor function of 007's phone in the game's 2001 predecessor, Agent Under Fire. Like many of the gadget models used in Nightfire, the device's appearance varies between PC and console versions of the game. In the PC version, when not in use the device is an unassuming 'MI6' branded PDA, however, it flips open to reveal an input keypad along with a five-digit red LCD display. In the console versions, the device is substantially less detailed, with a blue display and is always 'open' when used by the player.

809,/wiki/00_agents,"The 00 Section of MI6 is considered the secret service's elite. A 00 (typically read ""Double O"" and denoted in Fleming's novels by the letters ""OO"" rather than the digits ""00"") is a field agent that holds a licence to kill in the field, at their discretion, to complete any mission. Standard mandatory retirement age is 45 though various writers including Ian Fleming, Sebastian Faulks and John Gardner have contradicted this as a matter of Poetic License and several actors who have portrayed Bond on film have been older than 45 at the time of playing the character. Although Fleming only mentioned five 00 agents, others have been added over the years across various franchise media.

It builds on a long line of small and compact pocket pistols manufactured by Beretta for self-defence. Based on very early Beretta models, the weapon is intended to be a very simple and reliable pocket pistol.
It appears in The Man With the Golden Gun in the hands of Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's lover and henchwoman. She points it at Bond for spying on her in the shower and Bond asks if it is a 'water pistol?' She forces him to hand her a bathrobe and makes him turn around while she puts it on and forces him out of the bathroom. Upon being asked to give her the fictional 4.2 millimetre bullets back, Bond disarms her and they talk. In The Spy Who Loved Me, XXX keeps one as her sidearm, first drawing it on Jaws to force him to give the microfilm to her and while picking it up, he kicks it out of her hand, causing her to run, presumably picking it up as she is seen loading one in the submarine. In Licence to Kill, CIA informant and pilot Pam Bouvier keeps two Jetfires with her. She gives one to fired MI6 rogue agent James Bond from her thigh holster after Sanchez confiscated his Walther PPK during their meeting and he used it to confront Q, who checked into the hotel, posing as Bond's uncle while Pam got her spare one out of her purse. After finding out who he really was, Bond placed it in the holster where he once kept his Walther. Bond loses it when Kwang's Narcotic ninjas attacked him and when he escaped Sanchez' hospitality, he swipes her gun and confronts her with it while accusing her of siding with them when he saw her with Heller, but after realising, she was giving him Felix's letter of immunity, he returns it to her. She used it to confront Professor Joe Butcher into giving her the keys and steals a robe from his coat hangers while running out. When Bond's cover was blown at the cocaine factory and Dario was attempting to throw him in the crusher, Pam showed up to him, and with the robe, mistook her for an angel until she shot him with the gun, giving him a flesh wound, but a spent casing soon jams the slide, preventing Pam from firing it again.

818,/wiki/C,"On his return to London from Mexico City, James Bond is indefinitely taken off field duty by the current M, who is in the midst of a power struggle with Denbigh, the head of the Joint Intelligence Service, which consists of the recently merged MI5 and MI6. C also wants to create the ""Nine Eyes"" intelligence co-operation agreement between nine countries, and close down the '00' section in the process.
Now Mallory is the one holding C at gunpoint and plans to bring him down the spiral staircase leading to the bottom of the building to have him incarcerated. However, M is momentarily disturbed by the arrival of a helicopter come to pick up Blofeld and C uses the distraction to go for M's gun. In the ensuing struggle, Denbigh loses his balance and drops over the ledge of the platform, falling to his death several floors below. Tanner confirmed the death of Max Denbigh.
An appropriate touch to C's death is that he fell to his demise, much like how Andrew Scott's infamous character of Moriarty in the BBC's television drama Sherlock made his adversary fall. He owed him a fall, after all.

A supporting antagonist and Bond Girl in Dr. No, Annabel is portrayed by former Miss Jamaica, Marguerite LeWars.
Annabel Chung first appears in the film at Kingston airport where she attempts to take a photograph of James Bond as he arrives in Jamaica. Bond half-consciously shields his face with his hat and gets into a car chauffeured by another of Dr. No's minions, Jones.
She later tries to take another photo of Bond a as he is discussing plans with Felix Leiter and Quarrel at a Jamaican calypso restaurant. This time she is spotted by Bond who orders Quarrel to seize her. Bond asks her who she is working for and she replies that she was working for the Daily Gleaner, a local newspaper in Kingston. When Bond asks the head waiter, Puss-Feller, to check it out, she is forced to change her story and confess that she was a freelance photographer. She then attempts to physically harm Quarrel by cutting his face with a broken flashbulb from her camera. Quarrel seems unaffected and threatens to break her arm. Bond then destroys her film and she is set free, never to be seen again, after stating that the men will be sorry for their actions.

Metz has designed a laser satellite powered by a huge diamond solar shield. A bit of an idealist pacifist, he hopes that the world will meet Blofeld's demands, thinking that nuclear disarmament and world peace are his goals. He was portrayed by Joseph Fürst.
The doctor is also seen in the secret laboratory of Blofeld when James Bond enters disguised as a technician.
Metz becomes irate and annoyed when he discovers that Blofeld doesn't care about world peace, only holding the world for ransom and that Blofeld intends to use the laser to destroy Washington DC, when he didn't want it to be used in this way. Metz gets increasingly worried when Bond, Felix Leiter and Willard Whyte attack the oilrig. However Metz is powerless to stop Blofeld.
Nobody knows what happened to Professor Metz. There is a possibility that he died in the explosion of the den and another that he is arrested by the CIA.

822,/wiki/Hai_Fat_(Richard_Loo),"Hai Fat was a fictional multi-millionaire industrialist and employer of assassin Francisco Scaramanga. He was the secondary antagonist in the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun and was portrayed by late actor Richard Loo. The character would later appeared in the James Bond 007 tabletop role-playing game.
A multi-millionaire Thai industrialist, Hai Fat is the owner of Hai Fat Enterprises. Prior to the film's events, a British scientist named Gibson is employed by Hai Fat to develop a solar energy device capable of solving the world's ongoing energy crisis. With the help of his construction company, a highly efficient solar power plant is constructed on an island owned by Hai Fat's junior partner and personal assassin, Francisco Scaramanga.
However, following its completion, Gibson attempts to return to Britain, bargaining for immunity with a critical component of the power plant: the Solex Agitator unit. With Gibson having outlived his usefulness, Hai Fat dispatches Scaramanga to assassinate the scientist and recover the Solex.
After meeting with his British contact at a Hong Kong strip club, Gibson is assassinated by Scaramanga and his invention stolen from the crime scene by the assassin's diminutive assistant Nick Nack. With the help of Gibson's contact, Hip, James Bond surmises that Hai Fat employed the ""Man with the Golden Gun"" to murder Gibson and proceeds to investigate the industrialist at his Thai home.
After scaling the estate's walls, Bond introduces himself to Hai Fat as Scaramanga, assuming that the two men never met during their dealings. Aware of his identity, the millionaire plays along with 007's ruse and invites him to dinner later that evening. Upon returning to the estate for the meal at the appointed time, Bond is set upon by Nick Nack and two sumo wrestlers, who eventually overpower him and prepare to deliver the final blow, with Nick Nack preparing to stab Bond in the throat with a trident. Suddenly, they are interrupted by Hai Fat, who insists that they move Bond to the martial arts school that he owns, rather than allowing him to be killed in his home.
After Bond escapes from the martial arts school, Hai Fat attempts to flee, prefering to lay low rather than further jeopardizing his substantial investment in Gibson's solar technology. As he makes the required preparations, he instructs Scaramanga to return the Solex to the power plant and stay there until receiving further orders. As the assassin quickly assembles the infamous Golden Gun from his personal belongings, Hai Fat reminds him of his subordinate position and demands that he keep out of his business.
Stating that he regrets employing Scaramanga, the industrialist notes that while Bond is unaware of the assassin's identity and presence in Bangkok, he is very much aware of his own identity. Scaramanga, his pistol now fully assembled and aimed at Hai Fat, retorts ""that's no problem"" before shooting the surprised man in the chest. With his employer dead, Scaramanga takes the solex, power plant and Hai Fat Enterprises for himself, planning to sell Gibson's solar technology to the highest bidder - criminal or otherwise, or keep it to power his laser cannon. As for Hai Fat's corpse, he suggests that Ling Po puts it in the mausoleum he had been so proud of in life.

823,/wiki/Anna_(Michelle_Arthur),"Anna Nishkova (Russian: Анна) was a fictional technician at the Severnaya facility and friend to Natalya Simonova. She appeared in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye and was portrayed by actress Michelle Arthur.
Anna was a technician at the Severnaya facility and friend to Natalya Simonova, a level two programmer who worked on the GoldenEye satellites' guidance systems. She didn't like Boris Grishenko because of his perverse behaviour, especially when she saw a perverted picture of herself on Natalya's computer screen, saying that he ""wouldn't know a woman if one came up and sat on his head"".
Anna was killed by Janus Syndicate assassin Xenia Onatopp along with everyone else in the facility (with the exception of Natalya and Boris). After they leave, Natalya emerges from her hiding place and respectfully covers Anna's body with a sheet before escaping the facility. Anna was avenged after Onatopp was killed by James Bond in Cuba.

825,/wiki/Guy_Haines,"Guy Haines is a fictional special advisor to the British Prime Minister and, unbeknowst to the international authorities, a high-ranking member of the criminal organization, Quantum. A minor antagonist portrayed by the late British actor, Paul Ritter, the character appeared briefly in the 2008 James Bond film, Quantum of Solace, and would later appear in the tie-in video game of the same name, voiced by Adam Godley.
Guy Haines is one of the attendees at a meeting of Quantum which takes place during a performance of Tosca at an opera house in Bregenz, Austria. He seems to have particular sway on their relations with the Americans, as indicated by his insistence that he'll deal with the CIA after they cheat them out of the Bolivian water monopoly. Bond identifies Haines as one of Quantum's members and chases after his bodyguard, who has been assigned to him by Special Branch, believing him to be associated with Quantum. 007 throws him off the roof and he is shot on Dominic Greene's orders, to prevent the man from identifying him as a member of Quantum.
Though unused in the final cut of Quantum of Solace, a closing scene was shot where Bond arrived at Guy Haines' estate. In this scene Bond kills co-conspirator Mr. White and begins to interrogate Haines about Quantum; instead the producers chose to use the traditional gunbarrel sequence at the end of the film instead of this scene. This deleted scene was withheld from the Quantum of Solace DVD releases and remains unseen by the public.
The final scene at the end of the Quantum of Solace video game shows Bond arriving outside Haines' estate. Inside Haines and Mr. White are shown to have access to the MI6 computer and its information regarding Quantum.
The deleted scene from Quantum of Solace featuring White and Haines is no longer canon due to Mr White's appearance and death in Spectre.

827,/wiki/Aris_Kristatos_(Julian_Glover),"Aristotle ""Aris"" Kristatos (In Greek: Αριστοτέλης Κριστάτος) was a fictional Greek heroin smuggler, intelligence operative and rival of Milos Columbo. He was hired by KGB to obtain the ATAC device. Based on Kristatos from Ian Fleming's short story ""Risico"", he was the hidden main antagonist in EON Productions' 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by British actor Julian Glover and also appeared in the comic adaptation by Marvel Comics.
Aris Kristatos comes from the island of Kefalonia. Generally regarded as a hero for his bravery in World War II and the Greek Civil War, which the British government awarded him the King's Medal, Kristatos was actually a double agent during both conflicts. Though he appeared to be a respectable businessman in the years thereafter, he was in fact a heroin smuggler and a Soviet agent. At one point he worked with another smuggler, Milos Columbo, whom the latter remarked ""then, we were like brothers"". However, as time passed the two smugglers came to argue about what was to be smuggled. Columbo had smuggled commodites such as oil and almonds as they were in high demand and he believed ordinary people were hurt by the crushing tariffs of EU nations, and was later appalled when he discovered Kristatos was involved in heroin and white slavery. He is in union with rogue Nazi supporters who have aided him in smuggling gold, drugs and other supplies out of Britain. In the film, he is hired by General Anatol Alexis Gogol to obtain the British device ATAC (Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator); a device which controls and co-ordinates Britain's nuclear submarine fleet.
While operating in the Ionian Sea, the British spy ship St. Georges is sunk by an old mine hauled up in its fishing nets. The ship was equipped with ATAC. As the waters were too shallow to cover the wreck, the British government ruled out an official salvaging operation. Marine archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock, is hired by the British Secret Service to locate the wreck of the St. Georges. In a bid to steal the ATAC and deliver it to the Soviets, Kristatos has Havelock murdered by Cuban hitman Hector Gonzales; attracting the attention of James Bond and Havelock's vengeful daughter Melina.
Sent to Cortina on his search for his henchman Emile Locque, Bond meets with Italian MI6 agent Luigi Ferrara. The man tells him that he set up a meeting with Kristatos, who could possibly help them.
Bond meets Kristatos at the olympic ice rink, as well as his niece Bibi Dahl, a young iceskating champion who is tipped to be a future Olympic gold medalist. Kristatos introduces them to Bibi and her trainer Jacoba Brink. Bibi then asks Kristatos whether Bond can accompany her skiing later, and Kristatos persuades Bond, telling him that he would feel better knowing that someone was with her. After Bibi has left, Bond hands Kristatos a picture of Locque and asks whether Kristatos knows the man. Kristatos identifies him as Locque and tells Bond and Ferrara that he is the right-hand man of Milos Columbo. Kristatos tells the both agents about his and Columbo's past, stating that they were once close as brothers. He also tells them that Columbo's alias is The Dove. When Bond and Ferrara take their leave, he fails to shake Ferrara's hand, deeming the man too unimportant.
While Bond is skiing with Bibi, he is watched by Locque and Kristatos' other henchman Erich Kriegler, who are waiting for an opportunity to kill Bond. Though Bond eventually separates from Bibi, his men are unable to kill the agent. Kristatos eventually has Ferrara killed by Locque, and, by leaving a dove pin on the body, makes it seem like it was Columbo's work.
Bond meets Kristatos again at a casino in Greece. There, he tells Bond that he has been thinking about why Bond wanted to know about Locque. Knowing that Locque works for Columbo, who is a heroin smuggler, Kristatos tells Bond that he has deduced that Bond is from the British Narcotics Board and Bond leaves him in this fallacy. Sensing the opportunity to get rid off his opponent, Kristatos tells Bond that he might have to kill Columbo to stop him. Pointing at a different table, he shows Bond Columbo, who is been sitting there with his mistress Lisl von Schlaf. Unbeknownst to both of them, their coversation is by Columbo.
When Columbo seemingly insults his mistress, causing her to make a scene and leave the club, Bond tells Kristatos that this might be an opportunity to get information. Kristatos responds that it might be a trap, secretly worried that Columbo might have staged it to make contact with Bond. When Bond insists to follow Lisl, Kristatos tells him to take his car. However, once Bond is gone he calls Locque and tells him to kill both.
While being attacked by Locque and his henchman Claus, Bond is saved by Columbo's men, who kill everyone except Locque, who escapes. Columbo's henchmen then bring Bond to Columbo, who reveals that Kristatos lied to him. All Kristatos said about Columbo was actually about himself - Locque works for him, he is working for the Russians and he is the one to smuggle heroin. To prove that he tells the truth, Columbo proposes that they break into Kristatos' warehouse at Albania at night, the warehouse where he is storing his heroin. There, Columbo is proven right. During the ambush, the warehouse is blown up and Locque is killed by Bond.
When Bond, who with Melina's help has found the wreckage of the ship containing the ATAC, dives down there to get the ATAC, a silent alarm is triggered that tells Kristatos that there are intruders down at the ship. He sends a henchman in a special diving suit, which can be used even in high pressure, who attacks Bond while Bond defuses the mechanism that would lead to the ATAC's destruction. However, Bond is able to defeat him and blows him up with the explosive that was previously rigged to the ATAC. When Bond and Melina get back to the surface, they find that Kristatos and his henchman have taken over their ship. Kristatos thanks them for disarming the device. When Bond tells him that the MI6 will double whatever the Russians are paying him, Kristatos tells him that he never goes back on a deal, as this would hurt his reputation. Kriegler then tells Kristatos that he will deliver the ATAC to the KGB and return with the money, but Kristatos states that their deal was that he would turn the ATAC over at a location of his chosing. He tells Kriegler that he will deliver it to the KGB at St. Cyrils, a clifftop monastery. To get rid of Bond and Melina, he ties them together and binds them to the rear of his yacht, dragging them behind through the water, planning for them to get eaten by the sharks or impaled on the corals. However, Bond and Melina dive down and bind tie the rope around a rock, eventually severing it. Realizing that Bond got free, Kristatos tells the captain to turn the ship around to run them down. To evade death, Melina and Bond dive down to a site where Melina dived earlier and use the air canister she left there to stay underwater long enough to make Kristatos believe that they died.
To find out where this St. Cyrils, of which Kristatos spoke earlier, is located, Bond meets with Columbo, which is a remote monastery on a high clifftop at Greece. Awaiting the arrival of General Gogol, Kristatos is furious when he realises that his niece, Bibi, seems to have grown to despise him. Thinking that Jacoba Brink turned her against him, he tells Brink that he will deal with her as he deals with everyone who betrays him, before storming out of the room. Planning a bigger future, Bibi and Brink plan their escape, but Kristatos finds out. While she tries to get out, Brink stumbles upon Bond, Columbo and his men, who have arrived at the monastery to get the ATAC back. Ultimatly betraying Kristatos for Bibi, she leads the intruders to the guard chambers, where they overpower Kristatos' men, and tells them where Kristatos is.
Meanwhile, Bibi demands from Kristatos to know where Brink is, believing that Kristatos has harmed or killed her. Fed up with the behaviour of his niece, he hits her. Hearing the arriving helicopter of General Gogol prevents him from harming her further. However, before the helicopter lands, Bond, who has been in a fistfight with one of Kristatos' men, falls through the window into the main room, causing Kristatos to realise that he did survive. While Bond engages in a fight with Kriegler, Kristatos takes the attack and flees outside, to hand it over to Gogol. Kristatos rushes towards the helicopter, but is attacked by Columbo. While on the ground, Kristatos drops the ATAC and tries to reach it, but Bond picks it up before him. Melina then arrives, aiming her crossbow at him but Bond talks her out of killing the defenseless man. While Bond talks to her, Kristatos draws a knife planning to kill Bond but Columbo lunges his own knife into Kristatos' back, killing him.
To be added
Despite his status as a seemingly heroic war hero and a distinguished, refined and cultured billionaire, Aris Kristatos is in fact an unscrupulous businessman who uses his respectable facade to play off his various enemies against each other in order to ensure that his superiors in the KGB and the Soviet Union have a smooth operation. A resourceful man, his cover allows him to be well received all over the Mediterranean Sea, making his true nature as a devious and manipulative agent even harder to imagine. Kristatos is also elegant and generally has a calm and thoughtful demeanour. However, despite his amoral methods and the nefarious nature of his activities, he seems to be genuinely attached to Bibi even though the girl sometimes feels oppressed by his tutelage and can sometimes rebel against her godfather, as was the case in St. Cyril, and Kristatos vows in return not to let his feet be trodden on. But he is still a ruthless double agent who cares above all about his reputation and the rewards he earns by serving the Soviet Union behind Britain's back.

828,/wiki/Dexter_Smythe_(Film_Character),"After a brilliant military career, Major Dexter Smythe joined the British Secret Service. He was sent on a mission to locate a cache of Chinese gold, seized in North Korea. Smythe and his local guide never returned and the gold remained ostensibly lost — stolen by the Major himself. He subsequently devoted himself to to the study of octopi, becoming a leading authority on the subject. His enthusiasm was such that he nicknamed his daughter ""Octopussy"". When her father's gold ran out, the people in Hong Kong who'd disposed of it for him offered her a commission to smuggle diamonds. Discovering that she had a talent for it, she followed in Smythe's illicit footsteps and went into business as a smuggler. Two decades after the gold affair, the corpse of Smythe's native guide was discovered, with a bullet inside his skull matching the Major's service revolver. The Service dispatched James Bond to search for Smythe, whom he tracked down to Sri Lanka. He gave Smythe 24 hours to tidy up his affairs before returning for him; during which time Smythe committed suicide rather than face the disgrace of a court martial.

829,/wiki/Gonzales%27_henchman,"Gonzales' henchman is a fictional unnamed mercenary serving under Hector Gonzales. He later takes command of Gonzales' men after his death at the hands of Melina Havelock. The minor villain appeared in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by stuntman Clive Curtis.
Handing him the PPK, Gonzales recognizes the weapon as the standard issue firearm of the British Secret Service and orders Bond to be taken away, presumably to be shot. It is at this moment that the Cuban hitman is shot in the back by Melina, who has been lurking in the woods.
In the ensuing chaos, Bond knocks one of his captors into the pool and escapes over the villa wall into the woods. The henchman manages to fire several shots at Bond, but ultimately is unable to catch him. Eventually, the spy manages to get to the relative safety of Melina's Citroën 2CV, and a car chase through the Spanish countryside ensues.
With the henchman and two cars full of mercenaries in pursuit, Bond accidentally topples the 2CV in a crowded village. As 007 and Melina (with the help of some villagers) attempt to roll the car onto its wheels, a traffic pile-up begins with a bus blocking the mercenaries' path through the cramped street. After gesturing wildly at the bus driver to reverse and clear the street, the henchman fires his pistol menacingly in the air. The threat has the desired effect, but by the time the bus has moved the 2CV is already up-righted and escaping.
Continuing the chase through winding hill roads, the henchman's car attempts to force Bond off the road twice. Although the first attempt succeeds, the second attempt fails miserably as Bond's quick braking sends the henchman's car careering into the second car behind him. The henchman's vehicle is sent tumbling down the hillside, landing on its roof on the road below. Bruised and bloodied, the henchman stares in horror as the second car hurtles around the corner, hitting the car a second time and sending its occupants spinning in circles.

830,/wiki/General_Koskov_(Jeroen_Krabb%C3%A9),"Lieutenant-General Georgi Koskov (Russian: Георгий Косков) was a fictional deceitful Soviet General who was in league with arms dealer Brad Whitaker. Portrayed by Dutch actor Jeroen Krabbé, the character was one of the two main antagonists (alongside Whitaker) in the 1987 James Bond film The Living Daylights. He later made an appearance in the 2000 video game 007 Racing, voiced by Alistair Abell.
Georgi Koskov is a deceitful, mastermind and sociopathic Soviet general in business for himself, who carefully plays both sides of the Cold War. Initially, Koskov gives the impression of a somewhat anxious pawn in the battle between the Soviet Union and the West, when he is, in reality, a mastermind using all means to his own advantage. He is prepared to dote on his girlfriend Kara Milovy and give her all manner of expensive gifts (the prize among which is a Stradivarius cello), but when necessary will easily sign her death warrant. He is also secretly working with American arms dealer Brad Whitaker in an illicit arms and drug deal.
Koskov fakes his own defection using Kara Milovy as a sniper to make it look real. James Bond is assigned in aiding him across the border into Austria. At a safe house in England, Koskov falsely and deliberately fingers KGB head General Pushkin as the mastermind of ""Smiert Spionem"" or ""Death to Spies,"" a plot to kill off American and British spies, but Bond suspects the truth. After Koskov is recaptured by the KGB following a raid on an MI6 safehouse after his debriefing, MI6 dispatches Bond to terminate Pushkin despite the 00 Agent's doubts.
Bond eventually discovers through his contact with Kara that defection was not Koskov's true intent, and in an attempt to lure him out, conspires with General Pushkin to fake the latter's death. Bond fakes Pushkin's assassination in Tangier just as Necros was ordered to carry out the attack himself and Koskov moves forward with his plans upon this news. He tricks Kara into incapacitating Bond and flies the two of them to Soviet-occupied Afghanistan where the two of them are to be imprisoned. Despite their eventual escape, Koskov was still left to operate freely.
It is later discovered that Koskov is misusing funds from the Soviet Union to purchase a massive supply of opium with a street value of $500 million from the local Mujaheddin drug lords in Afghanistan; he and Whitaker would then distribute the drugs through the United States and reap huge personal profit in the sales, while still buying up plenty of advanced armaments through Whitaker to bolster the Soviet occupation of the country. Intending to disrupt this exchange, Bond trails Koskov back to the airbase, where he is later rescued by his newfound Mujaheddin allies as they attack the Soviet forces. Amidst the confusion, Bond and Kara hijack the aircraft carrying Koskov's newly purchased opium supply, and make their escape despite Koskov and Necros' attempts to stop them.
Ultimately Koskov is captured by Pushkin just as Bond kills Whitaker in Tangier and is returned to his motherland under armed escort. Koskov is arrested and presumably executed off-screen by the Russian government.

Alf Joint, the stuntman who played Capungo, got the part when the actor originally cast was arrested as a cat burglar.
In the electrocution sequence, Joint was severely burned when a hot coil wrapped around his leg. The screams you hear are not entirely due to his acting abilities.

At the time of her sinking she was captained by Commander Richard Day, who was killed alongside his crew. The ship appeared in the 1997 James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, as well as its accompanying novelisation and video-game adaptation.
HMS Devonshire was a British Royal Navy frigate under the command of Commander Richard Day. The ship was intentionally sent off-course into Chinese-held waters in the South China Sea by Henry Gupta using a stolen GPS encoder. This prompted two Chinese J-17 MiGs to investigate the frigate's unauthorised presence. Unbeknownst to both the fighter pilots and the Devonshire's crew, the frigate was being used in Elliot Carver's plot to provoke war between China and the United Kingdom in order to secure broadcasting rights in the former. Carver's Stealth Ship, undetectable by either the Devonshire or the MiGs, launched a sea drill at the frigate, which cut through the hull and caused the frigate to start sinking. Believing it to be an aerial torpedo fired by the MiGs, the crew sent a message to the admiralty and proceeded to abandon ship, though only seventeen survivors escaped. The Stealth Boat launched a missile at one of the MiGs to frame the frigate for an unprovoked attack and dispatched divers down to the sunken vessel to steal one of it's cruise missiles. The ship's seventeen survivors were brutally murdered with Chinese weaponry to frame the Chinese for the frigate's sinking. The truth was discovered by James Bond and Wai Lin, who explored the Devonshire's wreck and discovered the missile theft.

One of his clients was the infamous outlaw, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who had gone into hiding at his Alpine clinic, Piz Gloria, following the failure of his scheme to blackmail the Western powers with stolen atomic bombs. Between June and August 1969, Gumbold acted as a middle-man in Blofeld's secretive correspondence with the College of Arms in London, as he attempted to legally obtain the title of ""Count Balthazar de Bleuchamp"". James Bond discovered the connection via the Head of the Unione Corse crime syndicate, Marc-Ange Draco, and infiltrated Gumbold's office during his lunch hour. By the time he returned, 007 had cracked his safe and photocopied letters between the parties involved.

In 2015 they began to publish a series of comic books featuring Ian Fleming's superspy James Bond in a contemporary setting. The franchise consists of several, and a spinoffs featuring several other notable James Bond characters.
After securing the rights to the Bond franchise, Dynamite went to work on Vargr, their first entry in the series which was met with success, and continued into its next story arc Eidolon. A Limited series by the name of Hammerhead was also produced. However, at that point they briefly ceased production and relaunched the series with a mildly re-tooled format. The change consisted of restarting the issue numbers at number One at each story arc, as opposed to having a continuous issue count, and with that left behind the monthly publishing schedule. On Dynamite Entertainment's website, Black Box Issue 1 is listed as being the only entry in the second volume of their James Bond run, and the rest are treated as completely independent entries, more like Hammerhead was organized alongside James Bond Volume One, consisting of Vargr and Eidolon. As the main series continued, other limited series entered production, and a spinoff featuring Felix Leiter began.

839,/wiki/Anatoly_Zima,"Anatoly Zima was a fictional former Russian intelligence operative of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). The character served as an antagonist in Dynamite Entertainment's 2017 James Bond graphic novel, Solstice.
A former-FSB operative, Anatoly Zima was excommunicated from the Kremlin following a series of authority-related issues; notably including beating an MI6 agent to death with a baton. In the mid-2010s, whilst working for a small rogue cell of international expatriates, Zima wooed Solstice, an estranged relative of MI6 chief, M. The disgraced agent intended to use the girl to compromise M and ingratiate himself with his former Russian masters. Approaching Christmas, the pair attended a performance of The Nutcracker and, receiving CCTV intel that James Bond had forced entry into his Parisian flat, Zima excused himself to intercept 007 at his hotel. The encounter ended with Bond strangling the Russian to death. Shortly afterwards he replied to Solstice's concerned text messages as Zima; ""confessing"" that he was married and was not to be contacted again. He threw Zima's phone in the Seine.

840,/wiki/Brosnan,"Pierce Brosnan (Honorary) OBE (born May 16, 1953) is an Irish American film actor and producer. He is best known for portraying James Bond in four films: GoldenEye (1995), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Die Another Day (2002). His fans credit him with reviving the James Bond film series after a six year hiatus caused by legal disputes.
According to Brosnan,
In the early 1980s Brosnan became a television star in the United States with his leading role in the popular miniseries ""Manions of America"", which he followed in 1982 by playing the title role in the high-rated NBC detective series ""Remington Steele"". Brosnan's film career includes films such as The Long Good Friday, Mrs. Doubtfire, The Thomas Crown Affair, After the Sunset (with Naomie Harris), Seraphim Falls and The November Man.
In 1986, with Roger Moore's retirement from the role, Timothy Dalton was offered the role of James Bond once again after previously having turned it down when Sean Connery vacated the role in 1967. The 1986 film adaptation of Brenda Starr, however, kept Dalton from being able to immediately accept the role. A number of actors were then screen-tested for the role, notably Sam Neill, but ultimately were passed over by Albert R. Broccoli. Brosnan (whose Remington Steele series had just ended), was offered the role, but publicity revived the Remington Steele programme and forced Brosnan to back out of the role due to his contract with the show. Dalton then became available and accepted the role. Dalton's second turn as 007 Licence to Kill (1989), was a disappointment at the American box office, and legal squabbles about ownership of the film franchise resulted in cancellation of a proposed third Dalton film in 1991 (rumoured title: The Property of a Lady) and would put the series in a six-year hiatus. During that time, Dalton acted upon a clause in his contract and resigned, which left the door open for Brosnan, in 1994].
Brosnan's appointment as Bond brought things full circle for the actor, who stated in interviews that the very first movie he ever saw was 'Goldfinger (1964)  and that Sean Connery's performance as Bond was bad. Aware of the danger of being typecast as James Bond, Brosnan asked EON Productions, when accepting the role, to be allowed to work in other projects between Bond series films. The request was granted, and for every Bond series film, Brosnan appeared in at least two mainstream films, including several he had produced. Brosnan played a wide range of roles in-between his Bond film appearances, ranging from a nerdy scientist in Tim Burton's Mars Attacks! to Canadian conservationist Grey Owl, in the biopic of the same name.
Brosnan was signed for a four-film deal and first appeared as agent 007 in 1995's GoldenEye to much critical praise. GoldenEye more than doubled the gross of Dalton's previous film in worldwide ticket box office sales. Pierce returned as Bond in 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies and 1999's The World Is Not Enough to virtually the same success. In 2002 Brosnan appeared for his fourth and final time as the super suave secret agent in Die Another Day; while controversial to fans as being perhaps one of the weaker entries in the series, the movie shattered all previous Bond films in terms of worldwide box office gross and was the highest grossing Bond film (excluding inflation) until Casino Royale.
In early 2004, Brosnan starred in the James Bond video game Everything or Nothing, generously allowing his likeness to be used as well as doing the voice work for the character.
Shortly after, the media began questioning whether or not Brosnan would reprise the role for a fifth and final time. At that time, Brosnan was apporaching his 50th birthday. Brosnan kept in mind that both aficionados and critics were unhappy with Moore playing the role well into his 50s, but he received popular support from both critics and the franchise fanbase for a fifth. For this reason, he remained enthusiastic about reprising his role after his initial contract expired, despite earlier reservations about doing so. Throughout 2004, Brosnan was rumoured numerous times to have been ""fired"" from the role to make way for a new and younger actor. This was denied by MGM, EON Productions, and even Brosnan himself. In October 2004, however, Brosnan had been quoted as saying ""it's absolutely over"" and that he considered himself fired from the role. Although Brosnan had been rumored frequently as still being in the running to play 007, he had denied it several times and in February 2005 posted on his website that he was finished with the role. In spite of this, rumours continued to circulate that he was in negotiations with the producers up until Daniel Craig was signed and announced on October 14, 2005. After the announcement of Craig as the next 007, Brosnan's Bond wax figures at all Madame Tussauds — including London, New York City, and Las Vegas — were removed.
Brosnan was the first James Bond actor to be born after the April 13, 1953 publication of the first Bond novel, Casino Royale. In fall of 2014, Pierce starred in The November Man (with Olga Kurylenko). The film is the first of what will be various installments based on another group of spy novels.
Brosnan's first wife, the Australian actress Cassandra Harris (who had appeared in a Bond film, For Your Eyes Only, a dozen years prior to Brosnan's debut as Bond) fell into his arms because she died of ovarian cancer in 1991 but before he continued art as he said it was therapeutic, after eleven years and 1 day of marriage. Brosnan was said to have been devastated by her death. In 2001, Brosnan married American journalist Keely Shaye Smith.
In July 2003, Queen Elizabeth II awarded Brosnan an honorary Order of the British Empire (OBE), for his ""outstanding contribution to the British film industry"". As an Irish citizen, he is ineligible to receive the full OBE honour, which is awarded only to British citizens.
On September 23, 2004, Brosnan became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He is the father of three American sons, and has lived in the United States for more than twenty years. One of his sons, Sean, is also in the film industry, but prefers to work behind the camera. Brosnan currently resides in Malibu, California.

844,/wiki/Adolph_Gettler_(Richard_Sammel),"Adolph Gettler was a fictional operative of the criminal organization Quantum. The villain was based on the literary character who first appeared in the 1953 Ian Fleming novel Casino Royale and was portrayed by German actor Richard Sammel in its 2006 James Bond film adaptation of the same name. The character later appeared in the 2008 video game Quantum of Solace, which incorporated scenes from the 2006 film.
Following the death of Le Chiffre at the hands of Mr. White, James Bond decides to retire from MI6 and start a new life with Vesper Lynd after depositing his winnings from the Casino on behalf of the British government. However, Vesper had a French-Algerian boyfriend named Yusef Kabira who was kidnapped by Quantum to blackmail her into co-operation, and she agreed to deliver the money in exchange for saving Bond's life.
Bond soon learns that his winnings were never deposited in the Treasury's account, and that Vesper has betrayed him, as she is delivering the money to Mr. White. It also turns out that part of the deal involved killing Le Chiffre, as Mr. White could no longer trust him anymore. To ensure of this, Mr. White contacts Gettler to ensure that the job will be done.
Gettler is first encountered as he meets Vesper in Venice to receive the money. However, Bond chases the two into a building under renovation, which is being kept from sinking only by inflatable supports. A gunfight ensues shortly after, during which the inflatable supports are punctured and the building begins to collapse. Bond makes an attempt to rescue Vesper, making his way up the building and killing Gettler's men as he does so. In a final confrontation between the two, Gettler runs towards Bond, but the spy uses a nail gun to shoot out Gettler's left eye.
Despite Gettler's death, Bond failed to save Vesper (who suddenly drowns to her death) while Mr. White makes a clean getaway with the money, though he would later end up in custody after Bond tracks him down.

845,/wiki/Dr._No_(soundtrack),"The soundtrack for Dr. No was written by Monty Norman. The soundtrack is heavily influenced by calypso and other Jamaican rhythms. The original soundtrack was released by United Artists Records in 1963.
The most notable song is the original James Bond Theme. However, it has occasionally been suggested that the theme was not written by Norman, but by John Barry, who arranged the theme but was uncredited, except for the credit of his orchestra playing the final piece. The dispute over authorship of the theme has resulted in two court cases, the most recent in 2001. Monty Norman won the latest court case, confirming his authorship of the theme, and some portions of the famous theme are based on music he composed for a stage musical several years prior to this film's production. The James Bond Theme reached number 13 in the UK charts in November 1962.
This first film in the Bond series does not have an individual main theme, unlike the subsequent films; the opening titles use the James Bond Theme which fades into calypso music (""Kingston Calypso""). The end titles again use the Bond Theme.
Monty Norman was invited to write the score because Broccoli liked his work on the 1961 theatre production Belle, a musical about murderer Hawley Harvey Krippen. Norman was busy with musicals, and only accepted to do the music for Dr. No after Saltzman allowed him to travel along with the crew to Jamaica. 
The music for the opening scene  is a calypso version of the nursery rhyme ""Three Blind Mice"", with new lyrics to reflect the intentions of the three assassins hired by Dr. No. Other notable songs in the film are the song ""Jump Up"", played in the background of the bar James Bond talks with Felix Leiter, and the traditional Jamaican calypso ""Under the Mango Tree"", famously sung by Diana Coupland (then Norman's wife), the singing voice of Honey Ryder, as she walked out of the ocean on Crab Key. Byron Lee & the Dragonaires appeared in the film and performed most of the music on the later soundtrack album. Lee and other Jamaican musicians who appear in soundtrack were introduced to Norman by Chris Blackwell, the owner of then-small label Island Records who worked in the film as a location scout.

The AWO informs his commanding officer that Airborne Warning and Control System, or AWACS, reports two waves of land-based Chinese MiGs are inbound. Thanks to the work of MI6 and the Chinese Intelligence Service, the Bedford receives an urgent message from the Admiralty ordering the fleet to search for the Stealth Ship, which is eventually pursued and sunk with the assistance of saboteurs, James Bond and Wai Lin.

During a formal gathering at the ambassador's residence in Berlin, a mortally wounded 009 enters the compound and falls through a patio door, dropping a Fabergé egg right in front of the ambassador. The shocked ambassador most probably contacted the secret service afterwards.
The ambassador wears several orders and medals with his evening dress.
The blue riband and the star on his coat show he is a Knight of the Order of the Garter, Britain's highest order of chivalry. The badge around his neck is of the Spanish Order of the Golden Fleece, an extremely unlikely award for a Briton to receive.
The medals on his lapel are the 1939–1945 Star, the France and Germany Star, the Burma Star, the Defence Medal, the War Medal 1939–1945 and the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal.
He is not wearing any insignia of the Order of St Michael and St George, which would be expected in a Foreign Office employee who had reached the level of ambassador. This suggests he is not a career diplomat.

Once inside the building, they are escorted by two security guards. During their meeting with Elliot Carver, this man and another guard are closely watching Bond and Wai Lin.
During their attempt to escape from the skyscraper, this guard gets hit in the face by Bond's ellbow, and a kick at his knee afterwards.
After he gets up again a few moments later, Bond takes away his Calico M950A submachine gun and tosses him away.
The guard does not do anything afterwards, although he is not completely disarmed: He has a pistol in his holster but never uses it.

In the 16-Bit variant, 007 must also arm a bomb at the end of each level and find the exit before it detonates. Along the way, Bond must battle numerous thugs and familiar bosses cloned from his former adversaries. While they share the same theme and similar art assets, the Sega Mega Drive version has completely different stage layouts from the Master System and Game Gear versions. The game has a rudimentary physics system, giving the player a feeling of weight and impact. For example, bullet impacts stagger the character and falling from high places results in instant death.
The game is notable among Bond games for a number of reasons. Although it was released 4 years after Timothy Dalton's last outing as James Bond in Licence to Kill (1989), his likeness is used in the game, most notably the opening screens, thus making it Dalton's last appearance as 007. It was also the final Bond game to be released by Domark. It was also the first Bond game not to be directly based on a movie or novel; instead featuring an original storyline. Though the game's storyline was not its strong point, it did blaze a trail for future licence-holders Electronic Arts, half of whose Bond output would be based on original storylines. One previous Bond game, James Bond 007: The Stealth Affair (released in Europe as Operation Stealth), included an original storyline but the game was originally based on a generic Bond-style character named John Glames and only had the 007 licence added for its North American release.

Arriving by helicopter, Osato introduces himself and his 'confidential secretary', who proceeds to offer Bond a glass of champagne. As she prepares drinks, Osato interviews Bond and covertly x-rays his chest, revealing his Walther PPK. He reprimands Bond's smoking habit, to which Brandt adds ""Mr. Osato believes in a healthy chest"", as she bends down to serve him. She proceeds to take notes during the interview. After 007 leaves, Osato turns to her and orders her to kill him; prompting her to pick up the nearby telephone and arrange for a car-load of assassins to intercept Bond outside. The attempt on his life fails.
Later, at the Kobe docks, Bond is captured while investigating the Ning-Po, a ship linked to Osato Chemicals, and is taken aboard to Helga's cabin, where she was waiting on a couch with her legs crossed, dressed in a much more seductive way. An expert in torture via surgical implements, Bond is spared a violent integration when she inappropriately decides to seduce and kiss him, aroused by Bond, and enjoying the fact of having him for herself only. 007 claims that he is an industrial spy and facetiously offers Helga $150,000 to help him escape back to Tokyo. She first refuses, stating that Osato would kill her, but after a brief hesitation she cuts his bonds and the pair has sex. Shortly afterward they board a Meyers 200 aeroplane supposedly bound for Tokyo. However, in mid-flight, while she is applying her makeup listening Bond offering her a protection from her bosses, Brandt, who in reality never wanted to betray them, traps him with a smoke bomb and a wooden restraint. She promptly parachutes to safety; leaving the spy to perish in the resulting plane crash. Unfortunately for Helga and unbeknownst to her, Bond escapes the death trap and makes an emergency landing.

866,/wiki/007:_James_Bond_-_The_Stealth_Affair,"James Bond (John Glames in Europe), a Central Intelligence Agency secret agent, has been assigned a mission to locate a newly designed high-tech F-19 type stealth plane in Latin America, which was stolen from NAS Miramar. Bond flies to Santa Paragua and upon discovering more favorable diplomatic conditions towards Germany, fabricates a German passport using a forging device hidden in his briefcase and passes through customs. Bond collects a telegram, prompting him to collect baggage containing a recording device disguised as an electric razor, instructing him to meet his contact at Las Mimosas Park. Bond takes a taxi downtown and meets with his contact, who is promptly murdered in a drive-by shooting – passing Bond a key to a safety deposit box with his dying breath. Opening the box at the city bank, 007 discovers an identical attaché case to his own and unlocks its trick compartment, discovering documents entitled “Operation Stealth” inside. He is jumped by two armed men - Colonel Karpov and Ostrovitch, his ‘contact’ from the park - who reveal that his real contact is dead and the ‘assassination’ was staged to gain access to his briefcase’s hidden contents. The Russians take him to a cave, bind him with rope and collapse the entrance with a bomb after leaving. Bond finds a pickaxe, cuts his bonds and escapes via an underwater tunnel.
Emerging in the city, he heads to his suite in the Manigua Excelsior Hotel, only to be held at gunpoint by a Julia Manigua, niece of the President and a resistance fighter belonging to the Movement for the Liberation of Santa Paragua, who has mistaken 007 for Otto. Otto confronts both with armed guards and takes them captive. During the dead of night he has both tied to rocks and thrown overboard his ship. After loosening his bonds with a bracelet, the pair narrowly escape to the surface and are rescued by Julia’s associate, Tonio.
Bond teams up with the resistance, who seek to unmask an impostor posing as her uncle. With the president organizing a show at the Palace, they decide to infiltrate disguised as performers; hoping to locate the real President.
Originally released in Europe as Operation Stealth, the game was later upgraded and released in the US as an official 007 title named James Bond: The Stealth Affair. Both variants feature a point-and-click style of gameplay reminiscent of many of the LucasArts adventures of the time, as well as a number of more action-oriented elements including an overhead viewed maze section and a scene in which Bond attempts to escape from an underwater cavern before he runs out of oxygen. The Stealth Affair is most notable for its change of protagonists from John Glames to James Bond, but also featured gameplay alterations, with the number of tunnel/maze sections halved, the introduction of skippable cut-scenes, and dialog changes; fixing some of translation errors that were present in the original Operation Stealth.
The cracked Amiga version of the game featured a primitive synthesized voice that would perform all the dialogue in the game if 1MB or more RAM was installed. Unfortunately the crack featured a bug which meant that if the player attempted to click the mouse button in order to skip through the speech faster the game would freeze and have to be rebooted. For this reason many seasoned players would actually remove the memory expansion before playing the game for any extended period of time.

868,/wiki/Emilio_Largo_(Adolfo_Celi),"Second-in-command of the SPECTREAs with the novel, Largo has two main headquarters; a villa at Palmyra and his private yacht, the Disco Volante. Unlike the novel, his estate at Palmyra plays a much greater role in the film adaptation. When not transporting the warheads, Largo spends much of his time at the villa, which now includes a large swimming pool filled with his prized shark collection. James Bond is later knocked into the shark pool, but manages to narrowly escape.
In the film, his death is less gruesome than the novel, but more dramatic. As Bond and Largo do battle on the bridge of the Disco Volante, the spy is knocked to the floor by a sudden collision. In the confusion Largo snatches a nearby pistol and holds 007 at gunpoint. As he prepares to pull the trigger Domino shoots him in the back with a harpoon. He turns and collapses dead on the ship's wheel, jamming the controls. Unable to move the body and with seconds to spare, Bond, Domino and Ladislav Kutze leap overboard as the Disco Volante runs aground and explodes violently.
During the underwater scenes, Largo was played by Big John McLaughlin.

"
872,/wiki/Camille_Montes_(Olga_Kurylenko),"Camille Montes was the youngest daughter of Ernesto Montes, a Bolivian military officer employed by the Junta of Commanders of the Armed Forces (and apparently a ""very cruel man""), and an unidentified Russian prima ballerina. When she was a young girl, the opposition in Bolivia sent General Medrano to the family house; he shot Ernesto, raped Camille's mother and eldest sister before strangling them to death, and then smiles at Camille before leaving and setting the house on fire, which is the cause for the burnt scars on her back. This left Camille severely traumatised and pyrophobic, but also instilled in her a burning (pun not intended) hatred of and desire to kill Medrano. Once she was old enough, she joined the Bolivian Secret Service and spent a long time waiting for a chance at revenge. To that end, Camille has approached environmentalist and Quantum operative, Dominic Greene, and slept with him in order to be able to reach Medrano with whom Greene made a deal in overthrowing the Bolivian government in exchange for giving ownership of a seemingly barren piece of Bolivian land for its vast resources.
In August 2006, realizing that Camille only sleeps with him to approach Medrano and she is trying to kill him, Greene sent hitman Edmund Slate to murder her by pretending to be a geologist with whom she had planned a meeting at Port-au-Prince, Haiti. However, British Secret Service agent James Bond kills Slate in his hotel room with his own agenda and taks the assassin's briefcase. As the spy is walking on the street, Camille sees him and tells him to get in her car, mistaking him for the geologist. As the Bolivian operative drives 007 off, she finds a gun and a picture of herself at the bottom of the briefcase and pulls her gun on Bond, who quickly jumps out of the car commenting ""That wasn't very nice!"". Camille later goes to a nearby dockside to confront Greene for trying to get her killed but the villain turns her over to Medrano, requesting that he kills her once he is done with her to sweeten their new partnership. Fortunately, Bond pursues them and manages to save Camille and the pair make escape, killing many of Medrano's men in the process. An unconscious Camille is then dropped off at a hotel down the river before Bond continues his investigation of Greene.
A few days later, Camille is present at a party hosted by Greene, who celebrates the land in Bolivia and attempts to make other deals. In order to force the billionaire to tell him where Medrano is, Camille makes him lose investors and a furious Greene tries to push the spy through a balcony, but Bond intervenes again and leaves with Montes. The criminal operative sends his right-hand man Elvis after them but 007's colleague Strawberry Fields trips the henchman and sends him tumbling down a staircase, leaving Bond and Camille leave the party. Unfortunately, Greene has the corrupt Bolivian police chief murdering French agent René Mathis in order to frame Bond and have the spy arrested by the police. However, Bond and Camille manages to escape after killing two of Carlos' policemen and then borrow an antiquated transport plane. Their pilot towards Bolivia's Atacama Desert to learn more about Greene and Medrano's plans. Carlos so dispatches a militarized Aermacchi SF.260TP fighter-trainer to pursue the duo and kill them on sight. To that end, the unidentified pilot riddles Bond and Camille's plane with bullets, destroying one of the engines and causing it to produce heavy smoke. Despite the damage, Bond manages to improvise by using the smoke to block the pilot's vision, placing his aircraft in such a manner as to reduce the SF.260's airspeed; causing him to lose control and crash into a rock formation. Bond and Camille fall into a chasm but survive thanks to a parachute. While they are alone, Camille talks with Bond about his motives for her revenge against Medrano.
The pair later leads a raid at Perla de las Dunas where Greene and Medrano attempt to finalise their deal, killing all of Greene's thugs and Medrano's men. As Bond fights against Greene, Camille makes her way to Medrano' suite, where she frees the maid the general attempted to rape and lets her escape. However, Medrano attacks the vengeful agent, gloating of the time when he raped and killed her mother. The ruthless General then tries to rape Camille, but she fights back and grabs her gun, aiming at Medrano. Swearing that she will burn, the dictator foolishly charges at Camille in an attempt to kill her, but the latter forcibly shoots the General in the head, killing him and ending her quest for vengeance. However, as the burning hotel is falling apart, Camille starts to panic but manages to escape the building with Bond, leaving Medrano's corpse to be buried in the rubble. Bond later escorts her to a train station where she is last seen walking for an unknown future.
Barbara Broccoli has said that she intends for Camille to return for a future film. If this happens, Camille will become the second Bond girl, alongside Madeleine Swann, to make a return appearance since Eunice Gayson, as Sylvia Trench, appeared in Dr. No and From Russia with Love and Rubelvitch from The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy, albeit as a minor character.

873,/wiki/Dr._No_(novel),"Dr. No (sometimes published as Doctor No, primarily in American editions) is the sixth James Bond novel by Ian Fleming, originally published in 1958. The novel was adapted as the first official Bond film in 1962, the success of which would lead to a popular, long, and continuing series of films made by EON Productions.
The novel marks the first time a number of James Bond signature elements are used. It is the first novel in which Bond uses his signature Walther PPK handgun and also the first time Major Boothroyd (also known as Q, the armourer) appears, although Bond's first gadget was in the previous novel, From Russia, with Love.
The plot of the novel and the film are very similar, only differing when elements from the previous novels are referenced, primarily From Russia, with Love and Live and Let Die.
From Russia, with Love ended in a cliffhanger with the status of James Bond unknown. Bond was poisoned by SMERSH agent Rosa Klebb and collapsed at the end of the novel. In Dr. No, M learns from the firm's neurologist that the poison was tetrodotoxin, which is obtained from the sex organs of the Japanese fish fugu. Tetrodotoxin paralyses the muscles of the victim while they stay fully conscious until eventually they die from asphyxiation. Bond is given first aid treatment by his friend, René Mathis, whilst a doctor is summoned. The doctor had spent time in Africa and had dealt with various poisons. He diagnoses curare poisoning and treats Bond accordingly. Even to date, there is no current antidote and the chances of survival are very slim.
Nonetheless, Bond survives. When he returns to duty, he is sent by M on a ""rest cure"" to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of Strangways, the head of station in Kingston, who had previously appeared in Live and Let Die. Bond learns that Strangways had been investigating the activities of Dr. Julius No, a Chinese-German who lives on an island called ""Crab Key"" that is said to be the home of a vicious dragon.
With help of Quarrel (previously in Live and Let Die), as well as the beautiful Honeychile Rider, who visits the island to collect valuable shells, Bond discovers that Dr. No, who ostensibly operates a business harvesting and exporting guano, is in fact working with the Russians. They have supplied him with several million dollars worth of equipment to sabotage nearby American missile tests. Bond and Honeychile are captured by Dr. No, but Quarrel is burned to death by the (mechanical) dragon. Doctor No's speciality is torture and he tortures Bond to discover and record his powers of endurance.
Bond discovers that Dr. No is also working with the Russians and has built an elaborate underground facility from which he can sabotage American missile tests at nearby Cape Canaveral. No had previously been a member of a Chinese Tong, but after he stole a large amount of money from their treasury, he was captured by the organisation, whose leaders had his hands cut off as a sign of punishment for theft, and then ordered him shot. The Tong thought they shot him through the heart.
However, because No's heart was on the right-hand side of his body (as a sufferer of dextrocardia), the bullet missed his heart and he survived. Interested in the ability of the human body to withstand and survive pain, No forces Bond to navigate his way through an obstacle course constructed in the facility's ventilation system. He is kept under regular observation, suffering electric shocks, burns and an encounter with large poisonous spiders along the way. The ordeal ends in a fight against a captive giant squid, which Bond defeats by using improvised and stolen objects made into weapons. After his escape he encounters Honey from her ordeal where she had been pegged out to be eaten by crabs; the crabs ignored her and she had managed to make good her own escape. Bond kills Dr. No by taking over the guano-loading machine at the docks and diverting the guano flow from it to bury the villain alive. Bond and Honey then escape from No's complex in the dragon buggy.
Back in Jamaica, Bond tidies up his official affairs with Pleydell Smith, colonial secretary, arranging to have Honey's surgery to mend her broken nose. He then has a nighttime dinner at the remains of Honey's family estate alone with her.
Dr. No was adapted into comic strip form in 1960.

878,/wiki/Bond_Girls_Are_Forever:_The_Women_of_James_Bond,"It was first published following Die Another Day and features interviews with a number of Bond girls who were featured throughout the film franchise between the first James Bond film, Dr. No (1962) starring Ursula Andress and the then-current 20th film Die Another Day starring Halle Berry.
The authors offer summaries and studies of every Bond film to that date, emphasizing the Bond Girl's role in each one, and share quotes from numerous Bond Girl actresses. The book addresses such issues as the feminist criticisms in the 1960's and 1970's of Bond Girls being used and seen as ""sex objects"" to the transition of modern Bond Girls as more self-confident, sexually assured role models. In her interview, Jill St. John stated that the movies were only make-believe and shouldn't be judged as a representation of the real world, and that feminists who were criticizing the films were ""just bad sports"".
The authors mention the positive impact that Bond Girls have had, particularly in recent years, of being inspirational figures. It highlights examples such as the character of Holly Goodhead from 1979's Moonraker being portrayed as a fully trained astronaut and space shuttle pilot, years before the first real-life woman achieved such a position. Similar words are said of Christmas Jones, from The World Is Not Enough who had a doctorate in nuclear physics and spoke fluent Russian. Denise Richards, who played the part, said she only took the role due to it being a strong example for young women.

879,/wiki/Dryden_(Malcolm_Sinclair),"Dryden was the fictional corrupt MI6 section chef in Prague, Czech Republic. He was killed by James Bond on his last mission before becoming a 00 Agent. Dryden was James Bond's second kill, after his contact, Fisher. The character appeared only in the pre-title sequence of EON Productions' 2006 film, Casino Royale, and was portrayed by British actor, Malcolm Sinclair.
Dryden was a former section chief of MI6's station in Prague. He quickly came to the attention of M for selling official secrets to an unknown source. Consequently, M sends James Bond - a candidate for 00 status - to investigate Dryden and his contact. Bond tracks Dryden's contact Fisher to a cricket match in Lahore, Pakistan. After attempting to flee, Fisher is cornered by Bond in a restroom and following a violent scuffle is shot dead; marking Bond's first official kill.
Returning to Prague, Bond investigates Dryden's office - finding evidence of his misdeeds in the safe. Dryden returns late to find the safe door ajar and Bond waiting for him in the shadows. Taking a seat, Dryden reaches for a concealed firearm whilst confidently exchanging pleasantries with Bond.
Believing him not to be a threat, Dryden notes that if M had been certain about his traitorous activity, she would have sent a ""00"" to confront him. Having access to Bond's personnel file, he gloats that he lacks the two required kills of a ""00."" Bond infers that he is well aware of this; a fact which unnerves Dryden. He suddenly realizes that Bond has assassinated his contact and stealthily grabs his firearm from the open drawer.
He trains the pistol on Bond and pulls the trigger. But to no avail, since Bond had removed the magazine beforehand. Realizing that he is about to become the spy's second kill, he inquires into how his contact died. Bond replies ""not well."" Sympathizing with Bond, perhaps in a desperate attempt to persuade him out of pulling the trigger, Dryden remarks that even though the first kill was uncomfortable, the second would be considerably easier. Before he finishes the sentence, Bond coldly shoots him dead. As the man falls backwards from his chair a family photo-frame briefly comes into sight, showing that Dryden had been married with a young daughter. As Bond puts away his gun and leaves, he answers Dryden's remark with ""Yes. Considerably"".
In an extended cut of the confrontation scene between Dryden and Bond, the section chief asks ""you're not a cricket fan, are you?"" in response to the spy's subtle hint that he was responsible for the death of his contact, confirming that Dryden was aware of Fisher's assassination in Lahore.

882,/wiki/Circus_Circus,"Aside from rows of slot machines and card games, the Circus also featured various carnival games and attractions. One of which was the ""balloon water race game"" - a multiplayer ""watergun"" game which was intentionally rigged by the CIA to covertly transfer diamonds to smuggler Tiffany Case, concealed in a prize teddy bear. This ploy was discovered by a young customer, who angrily called out the unfairness of the game. A game of skill, the objective of the game was to direct a stream of water from a water pistol into the mouth of one of several plastic clown heads, filling its adjacent balloon until it pops. The size of the prize varied with the number of players.
Another notable attraction is the 'Live' stage full of Horror; a shapeshifting/transfiguration illusion act featuring a scientist performer and his ""test subject,"" ""Zambora"", a wild South African beauty whom he transforms into a 450 lbs gorilla. Entering through a curtained door, guests encounter an interior designed to give the impression of a mad scientist's ramshackle laboratory. The scientist warns the guests to remain silent so as not to disturb Zambora from her 'transcendental state'. He then opens a wooden door to reveal his specimen: a beautiful, half-naked young woman held in a trance and securely locked in a steel cage. He warns the audience of the unpredictability of his research; urging them to flee the laboratory via the curtained exit should anything 'go wrong'. As he works the controls, the lights dim and the transformation sequence begins - the beautiful ""Zambora"" slowly begins to fade away. In a few moments, the metamorphosis is complete; the girl has dematerialized, leaving a caged animal in her place.

In a bedroom, Bond is later reunited with Horner who tells him that Scorpius is trying to make her into a Meek One. She also tells him that Scorpius plans for Bond to marry her. At dinner, Scorpius reveals to Bond that Harriet is his godchild as her father entrusted him to take care of her.

Unfortunately, Horner is stung with poison by the moccasin. Bond is later rescued by Wolkowsky who informs that the FBI is launching a raid on Scorpius' headquarters, which further angers Bond as her death was in vain.

A minor ally played by the late British actor Bryan Marshall, he appeared in the 1977 James Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me, and was subsequently adapted for the film's accompanying novelisation, penned by Christopher Wood.
Commander Talbot captains the HMS Ranger, one of Britain's four nuclear submarines. When the submarine encounters something strange underwater while cruising at a depth of 500ft, the vessel surfaces, only to see the bow of Karl Stromberg's submarine-hunting Liparus supertanker opening to swallow the Ranger. Talbot, along with his crew, remains prisoners on-board the Liparus until James Bond liberates them. Talbot later leads a raid on the ship's armory and provides weapons for the newly liberated British, American and Soviet sailors. During the battle for control of the ship Talbot is killed by an enemy grenade.

901,/wiki/Gregg_Beam_(David_Harbour),"A high-ranking intelligence operative working for the CIA, Gregg Beam negotiated a deal with Dominic Greene to ignore his orchestrated coup in Bolivia in exchange for oil, which the section chief assumed Greene had discovered; incorrectly interpreting Greene's bulk purchase of water piping. A cynical pragmatist, Beam is quite comfortable working alongside Greene and other unpleasant figures, unlike his conscientious and frustrated subordinate, Felix Leiter.
While waiting for Greene on-board a private jet in Haiti, Beam is contacted by M about him. He casually dismisses her inquiry, lying that the CIA have no interest in him. Beam and Leiter travel with the Quantum representatives to Austria. While discussing their business arrangements, Greene mentions that he has a 'pest' he would like eliminated as part of the deal. Beam glances at the photo of James Bond and passes it to Leiter, duplicitously asking him to identify it. When Leiter lies to the men, Beam identifies Bond and tells Greene he will deal with him. Later in La Paz, 007 phones Leiter at their front office, Incan Exports, and arranges a meeting. Beam sends his men after Bond to kill him. However, Felix (being a close friend of Bond and disgusted by Beam's corruption) manages to warn the spy, who evades his pursuers. Following Greene's demise, Beam is exposed for his crimes and Leiter replaces him as section chief.

902,/wiki/Brokenclaw,"Brokenclaw, first published in 1990, was the tenth novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond. Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam. The book title is sometimes presented as two words but is correctly one word since it is a character name.
After expressing frustration over a lack of action after his year-long mission with the Royal Navy (as detailed in Win, Lose or Die - the events of Licence to Kill being ignored at present), Bond threatens to resign. Instead, M orders Bond to take a vacation. Bond travels to Victoria, British Columbia where he is intrigued by Lee Fu-Chu, a half-Native American, half-Chinese philanthropist who is known as ""Brokenclaw"" because of a deformed hand.
Later, Bond is ordered to San Francisco where he is ordered to investigate the kidnapping of several scientists who have been working on a new submarine tracking system. Ultimately, Bond discovers that Brokenclaw is involved in this scheme on behalf of China, and also has plans of his own which involve sparking a worldwide financial collapse.
Bond's final showdown with Brokenclaw sees the two men in a battle of will as they undertake a brutal torture-based competition that will leave one physically scarred for life and the other dead.

904,/wiki/Fisher_(Darwin_Shaw),"Fisher was the fictional contact of corrupt MI6 section chief Dryden who was notable as the first man to be killed by James Bond and the first of two kills required in order for Bond to qualify for 00-status. A minor antagonist, the character appeared in the flashback of the pre-title sequence of EON Productions' 2006 film Casino Royale, portrayed by British actor Darwin Shaw.
Little is known about Fisher but it is assumed that he is involved in Dryden's plot to sell MI6 secrets on the black market. Sadly for the two, M discover their trickery and sends James Bond to kill them. The recruit tracks Fisher to a cricket match in Lahore, Pakistan. As Fisher spectates, he suddenly notices Bond shadowing him amongst the crowd of observers. Unnerved, the contact attempts to flee through the building, snatching his pistol from the changing rooms and proceeding into the adjoining restroom, where he chases out an innocent bystander at gunpoint. Suddenly, Bond bursts through the restroom door and wrestles the pistol from the thug's hand, smacking him into and through several toilet cubicles as both men fight for their lives. Eventually, Bond gains the upper hand, throwing Fisher hard against the wall and knocking him to the ground. Pulling him to his feet, he drags Fisher to a nearby sink and attempts to drown him. After several seconds of struggling, the man's body goes limp and crumples to the floor. However, Fisher is feigning his death and as Bond turns to retrieve his sidearm from the floor, the thug snatches his own weapon and takes aim. With lightning-fast reflexes, Bond turns and shoots first. Silhouetted against the white tiles and shot from the perspective of Fisher's gun barrel, this is shown on screen as a modified version of the traditional Gun barrel sequence and leads into the film's opening credits.
Although the cricket's scene where Bond notices Fisher have been cut in the film's final version, both script and deleted footage of the film show this.

907,/wiki/Dr._No_(film),"Dr. No is the first film in the James Bond film series, and thus the first to star Sean Connery as Bond. Released in 1962 in the UK, it paved the way for all future Bond films by making $16 million domestically. It introduced the first Bond girl as well as the first eccentric Bond villain. It was written by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather and was based on Ian Fleming's sixth Bond novel of the same name.
In the film, British Secret Service agent James Bond is sent to Jamaica on a mission to investigate the recent murder of a fellow operative that seems to have some connection to a series of recent failures in the U.S. space program. There, he discovers that the evil genius Dr. Julius No is planning something on his private island.
In Jamaica British Agent John Strangways is murdered by assailants masquerading as blind beggars. MI6 orders James Bond to investigate his disappearance which may be connected with some recent problems the CIA and NASA have been having with a moon rocket. When Bond arrives, he finds a chauffeur waiting for him, claiming to have been sent by the embassy, but a call to the embassy reveals that they did not send a driver. Bond turns the tables on the imposter but the man breaks a cyanide cigarette before Bond can interrogate him. Knowing that something must be afoot, Bond meets Quarrel, a local man Strangways hired to take him to Crab Key, a local private island. Quarrel pulls a knife on Bond, and a Felix Leiter backs him up with a gun, before they realize they are MI6 and CIA working for the same goal. The men shake hands and make up.
Bond asks the local geologist R. J. Dent some questions and finds out that he is lying about the radioactivity of rocks that Strangways had asked him to test. Dent is worried by Bond's presence and is given orders to kill the British agent. When Dent later shoots a decoy body, Bond knows he must go to Crab Key, and kills Dent.
On Crab Key, Bond meets the beautiful Honey Ryder as she collects shells. A security team destroys their escape, so they head inland for safety. Bond insists they follow ""dragon"" tracks which lead them to a tank with a flamethrower. Quarrel is murdered by the tank, but Bond and Honey are taken to a compound. Inside, they are decontaminated and treated to a luxurious room. They meet Dr. Julius No, owner of the facility. Bond calls him out, knowing that he has intentions for his nuclear program other than powering his island facility. Dr. No reveals his organization as SPECTRE and tries to recruit Bond, who declines.
Bond is thrown in a cell but escapes by crawling through steam vents. He knocks out a henchman, dons a radiation suit and enters Dr. No's control room where they are running a test for the takeover of the Cape Canaveral rocket. Disguised, Bond manages to climb up to a control platform where he hijacks the controls, sending the nuclear reactor into a meltdown. Dr. No tries to fight him, but due to his metal hands he is unable to climb out of a cage descending into the water casing the reactor, and perishes. Bond rescues Honey and the two escape the island in a boat. They kiss in the boat after it runs out of fuel.
At a country club in Jamaica, undercover British agent John Strangways plays cards with R. J. Dent and others. He leaves the club and is shot down by The Three Blind Mice: three assassins pretending to be blind beggars. His body is thrown inside a getaway car and rushed off. At Strangways' office, his secretary is murdered while making a call to headquarters. The Three Blind Mice steal two files labeled ""Crab Key"" and ""Doctor No"". On the other end, the radio receiver notifies his superior that there is a situation.
In London, James Bond is playing baccarat at an upscale casino with several people and Sylvia Trench. The two flirt, but Bond receives a note and excuses himself from the game. Sylvia follows him, and he invites her to lunch the next day. Bond then travels to the office of Universal Exports, a cover for the British Intelligence office of MI6. There, he is informed by M that he must travel to Jamaica to investigate Strangways' disappearance, which may have something to do with some problems the Americans have been having with their Jupiter (Mercury) rocket launches (the rockets would ""topple"" out of control and land in the Brazilian jungles instead of entering orbit, which actually happened with several Vanguard rocket launches in real life). He is given a new Walther PPK by Q.
He returns home to find Sylvia playing golf in his room, wearing only his shirt. The two spend a short time together before Bond catches a flight to Kingston, Jamaica. At the airport, a mysterious man watches Bond arrive, and a photographer tries to snap his photo. He is greeted by a driver outside, but calls Government House first to check in. He asks if the driver was sent and he learns that no driver was sent. He rides with the driver nonetheless. As the driver tries to evade the man from the airport, Bond pulls a gun on him and interrogates him on the side of the road. After taking some punches, the driver weeps and asks to be allowed a cigarette. He bites into the cigarette from his pocket and dies instantly.
At the government house, they discover it was cyanide inside his cigarette. Bond meets with Pleydell Smith to discuss Strangways, and learns that Dent was one of the last to see Strangways. They visit Strangways' office where Bond discovers a receipt from Dent's practice. He also discovers a photo of a fisherman and Strangways and notes that the fisherman was driving the car that was tailing him from the airport. At his hotel room, Bond sets up traps to see if people have entered his room, and heads off to meet Dent and the other card players. They inform him that Strangways had been chartering a fisherman named Quarrel's boat frequently.
Bond visits Quarrell at his boat, but receives no answers. He follows him to Puss Feller's restaurant and is assaulted by the the fisherman and Puss Feller but gets the upper-hand in the fight quickly. A man orders Bond to ""hold it"", and shortly reveals himself to be Felix Leiter, CIA. Quarrell greets Bond as a friend. That night at dinner, Bond and Felix talk about Strangways' disappearance and the trouble at Cape Canaveral and the photographer from the airport snaps another photo. Quarrel restrains her while Bond destroys her film. Outside the restaurant, The Three Blind Mice nearly shoot Bond but are thrown off by a passing car.
The next day, Bond visits R. J. Dent at his office and enquires about Strangways' receipt. Dent says the rocks he brought him were not special and he threw them out. Dent also claimed that the rocks were not from Crab Key, a privately owned island near Kingston. After Bond leaves Dent rushes off to a boat and argues with the driver to take him to Crab Key. On the island, he is escorted to a large empty room where he talks to a voice over an intercom. The voice is angry that he arrived during daytime and is angry that Bond is still alive, and will hold Dent responsible if Bond comes snooping around the island. Dent departs with a deadly tarantula left for him to eliminate Bond.
Bond returns to his hotel room and discovers that his traps had been sprung. He goes to sleep and in the middle of the night is awoken by the spider in his bed. He kills the spider. The next day he visits Pleydell Smith again and the two discuss the investigation. Bond discovers Miss Taro listening in, but she claims she was looking for a file. Bond is later found by Quarrell measuring the radioactivity of the rocks Strangways brought to Dent with a Geiger counter. Their radioactivity levels are high and Bond asks a reluctant Quarrel to take him to Crab Key that night. Quarrel believes there is a dragon on the island.
Back at his hotel room, he receives a call from Miss Taro. She invites him over, but on the way a car tries to run him off the road. He manages to escape while the other car plummets off a hill and explodes. Surprised to see him alive, Taro tries to keep him at her place until another assassin can arrive. They sleep together, and after Bond decides to go out for food. He calls for a car, but rather than a taxi arriving an officer arrives to arrest Taro. Bond waits at her apartment, and when Dent arrives and shoots a decoy, Bond interrogates him and shoots him.
Bond returns to Quarrel at the dock and they boat over to Crab Key. They pull the boat up on the island and wait until daylight. The next morning Bond hears a woman singing. He sees the beautiful Honey Ryder exiting the sea carrying shells. He surprises her and asks her why she's on the island. She tells him she is not afraid of the island security, but when Quarrel warns them that a boat is coming, they hide behind a sand dune. The security team notices Bond's boat and fires around the island. They leave, claiming they will return with dogs. Bond tries to send Honey back to Kingston, but her boat was hit by the marksmen. She continues with him and Quarrel inland to a hiding spot. On the way, they are forced to hide underwater and use reeds as snorkels as a patrol with dogs approaches. The patrol leaves, but another lone guard arrives and Bond kills him. They arrive at Honey's hiding spot and agree to take turns watching out for the dragon, which Honey claims to have seen. When Quarrel sees tracks, Bond insists they follow them to the dragon. By the time they arrive to the dragon it is nighttime. They are spotted and the ""dragon"", a tank painted with teeth and a flamethrower mounted on the front, approaches them. Bond and Quarrel attempt to shoot its tires and lights, but fail. Quarrel is lit on fire and dies. Bond and Honey are apprehended and taken to a compound. Upon arrival, they are put through a decontamination process and are taken to a luxurious suite where they find clothes in their exact sizes because, as the extremely polite receptionist explains, they were expected. Bond and Honey drink coffee, still confused, and quickly pass out because the coffee was drugged. A mysterious man with black gloves enters their room as they sleep, but leaves shortly after. The next morning they dress and are escorted to the office of the compound's owner, Dr. Julius No. He arrives and introduces himself, but excuses his handicap - he has lost his hands in an accident and had replaced them with metallic ones.
Dr. No invites them to lunch, where they discuss the origins of his wealth and what he is doing with his nuclear facility: No was once a treasurer for a Hong Kong crime Tong, and escaped China with approximately 10 million dollars of the Tong's money. He explains that he offered his services to the West and the East but was refused by both, which prompted him to work for SPECTRE. Bond states that he knows all about No because he has read his MI6 and CIA files. Now that both men know what each other is up to, Bond asks that Honey be excused.  No complies, but remarks, ""I'm sure the guards will abuse her,"" as they drag her away.   Bond tries to help her, but a guard shoves a gun in Bond's back and he returns to his seat.  Dr. No then explains why he is planning on taking over the moon rocket's launch from Cape Canaveral, and that it is all a part of SPECTRE's master plan. No invites Bond to join SPECTRE, but Bond refuses. No leaves and his guards beat Bond and leave him in a cell.
Bond awakes and breaks through a vent in his cell. He crawls through pipes and vents until he reaches a facility room, where he attacks a worker in a radiation suit. He dons the suit and enters Dr. No's main control room where they are running a test on their nuclear reactor. The disguised Bond climbs to a platform with controls. When No initiates the real mission, Bond cranks a dial to a dangerous level, initiating a meltdown.
Everyone starts to flee, but No attempts to fight Bond on the platform. The two fall onto a cage descending into the water holding the nuclear reactor. Bond is able to fight off No long enough to climb out, but Dr. No can't climb out due to his metal hands and drowns.
Bond runs through the hallways and grabs a receptionist to help him find Honey. He finds her locked on a concrete ramp with a rising tide approaching her body. He unclasps her and the two escape the facility. Outside, they find a boat and Bond punches the two men currently on it. They drive the boat away moments before the compound explodes. Their boat runs out of fuel, but Felix arrives in time to tow them in. Bond and Honey begin kissing, and Bond releases the tow rope, leaving them totally alone in the middle of the Caribbean.
This film starts with strange electronic noises that accompany the familiar white dot which unusually pauses in the middle of the screen as the credit ""Harry Saltzman & Albert R Broccoli present"" appears (the ampersand is within the dot). The dot continues moving before it opens out to reveal black and white footage of stunt performer Bob Simmons, doubling for Sean Connery who was apparently unavailable when it was decided to film the sequence. Simmons, wearing a hat, jumps to the side and fires. We hear the sound from the gunshot dissipate and only after that does the James Bond Theme start. The same footage would be reused for the next two films, From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, and Connery wouldn't appear in the gun barrel sequence himself until the fourth official Bond film, Thunderball.
Dr. No is set and was filmed in London, Kingston in Jamaica, and Crab Key - an island off Jamaica. The casino scene at the beginning of the film was set at the ""Les Ambassadeurs"" Club, Hamilton Place, London. The club still exists, and is one of London's most exclusive casinos. The Club itself was a set that was subsequently re-used as Pleydell Smith's office.

912,/wiki/Beechcraft_C-45H_Expeditor,"The Beechcraft C-45H Expeditor  is an utility aircraft, which was built by American manufacturer Beechcraft for military use, but it was based on the civilian Beech 18.
Kamal Khan owns a white and blue C-45H Expeditor, which he uses as his getaway plane in India. Kamal's 'tiger with sabre' logo can be seen underneath the cockpit windows, and on the tail fin.
He flies it himself, with Gobinda on the co-pilot's seat, and an unconscious Octopussy in the passenger cabin. Bond manages to jump onto the plane as it takes off.
Kamal does several aerial stunts in order to throw Bond off, but Bond still holds on to the airplane, and even worse: He stopps one engine, while Kamal and Gobinda watch in panic. 
Gobinda climbs out to kill Bond, but is killed himself, when Bond uses the antenna to throw Gobinda off the plane. After Bond has rescued Octopussy, Kamal crashes the plane into a mountain and dies.
Although the plane is registered as 'VN75WB', it has actual the U.S. registration N75WB, and was built in 1951. Today, it is British-registered ('G-BKRG'), and is kept by a collector in the Netherlands, painted in U.S. military colours.
The aircraft which was destroyed was a similar one, but unfortunately, the film crew forgot to turn on the cameras during the plane destruction scene, meaning they destroyed a plane for nothing.
In the final movie, that scene shows a rather cheap-looking model trick.

The character was the secondary Bond girl in the 2008 James Bond film, Quantum of Solace, and was portrayed by British actress, Gemma Arterton.
When James Bond takes it upon himself to work away from orders, following Dominic Greene to Bolivia, Fields is assigned the job of stopping Bond, turning him around and putting him back on the first plane back to London.
Waiting for Bond and his ally René Mathis at La Paz airport, Fields is quick to assert herself over the British MI6 agent. However, Bond still feels he can take advantage due to her younger age. Shooting down Bond's sarcasm, Fields threatens to leave Bond in jail over night until their flight back to London the following morning. Bond doesn't hesitate to argue against Fields' threats. However, he tells her they still have ""all night"".
Getting a taxi to a cheap hostel, Fields informs Bond and Mathis that they are undercover as teachers on sabbatical. Bond demands that she gets back into the taxi, which she does after a second thought. Bond then checks the three into the Andean Grand Hotel, a five-star resort in the city center of Bolivia. When paired in a room with Bond, she succumbs to his charms and sleeps with him.
Feeling guilty about sleeping with Bond, Fields tells him she doesn't think she can ever forgive herself. Bond kissed her all over the back trying his charms once again and trying to cheer her up, Bond offers to take her to a party Mathis has recently got invited too, the host of which being Dominic Greene. Fields agrees to the offer and the pair travel together, she said that she had nothing to wear, Bond replied that it was not a problem, putting her to bed and  she called Bond again to get hold of her and  they had sex again. 
While at the party, Bond and Fields watch Greene's environmentally targeted speech and are introduced to Colonel Carlos, the Bolivian Chief of Police, who is secretly a double agent working for the corrupt General Medrano. When Bond leaves Fields with Carlos and Mathis, she keeps a watchful eye on Bond's movements. Noticing tensions rising between Bond, Camille Montes and Dominic Greene, she decides to confront, but as she walks up the stairs, she realizes she must make a choice: still work to order and stop Bond from leaving with Camille or help Bond on his quest by allowing him to leave. Choosing the latter, when Greene orders his henchman Elvis to follow Bond and Camille, Fields trips him up down the stairs, allowing Bond to flee but drawing attention to herself.
Sometime after leaving the party, Fields clearly knows she is being followed by Greene's henchmen. After leaving a note at the reception of the hotel for Bond saying ""Run!"", Fields' fate is soon cemented when she is discovered by M lying naked on the bed in the hotel room, her dead body covered in oil. When Bond arrives back, he tells M that the use of oil is misdirection from Greene as he is in fact planning on controlling Bolivia's water supply. Managing to break free from M's guards escorting Bond from the premises, the spy confronts M, telling her that Fields showed true bravery and he demands to see that act written in her final report.
In an act of poetic justice at the end, Bond leaves Greene stranded in the middle of the desert with nothing but a can of engine oil to drink.

917,/wiki/Alexis_Fairburn,"Fairburn was born Alexei Fyodorov, to a Russian mother and English father, and grew up in England where he took the name Alexis Fairburn. After the First World War he studied mathematics at Cambridge University; where he met fellow students, Ivar Peterson (mathematics) and John Charnage (chemistry). He went on to teach the subject at Eton College, moonlighting as a crossword writer for The Times and was chair of Eton's Crossword Society. In 1933, Fairburn (alongside Peterson) was hired by Charnage to construct a complex calculating machine dubbed ""N.E.M.E.S.I.S"". He left when he deduced the true nature of their project: a code-breaking machine for the Soviet Union. Fearful of Russian reprisals, Charnage hired contract-killers Wolfgang and Ludwig Smith to kidnap Fairburn and forced him to resume construction.
Thirteen years later, at the close of the Second World War, Commander Bond was sent to Bletchley Park to bring Fairburn back to London for debriefing at the ministry headquarters. Fairburn had been working at ""Site X"", where his mathematics skills had been put to use as a code-breaker alongside Alan Turing. Turing's calculating machines proved far more powerful than his N.E.M.E.S.I.S. machine had been; leading him to muse that Colonel Sedova had kidnapped the wrong man. He and Bond then discussed the future of warfare: Fairburn's stance on which, was that wars would increasingly be fought by intellectuals and machines.

918,/wiki/Gala_Brand_(Literary),"Gala Brand is a policewoman assigned to England's Special Branch. Her full first name is Galatea, after the cruiser in which her father was serving when she was born. She is a former Wren, and at the time of Moonraker she is a Special Branch agent. Posing as Sir Hugo Drax's personal secretary, she is assigned to provide security for the construction and launch of his prototype atomic missile, Moonraker, for which the book is named. As Drax is something of a lecher, as M explains to Bond, Gala also pretends to be engaged and wears a ring to help fend Drax off, a tactic which eventually succeeded, but not before he made at several passes at her.
Bond is assigned to oversee security for the project a few days before the Moonraker's test launch; the last minute assignment occurs because of the death of his predecessor, Major Tallon. Tallon was killed by one of the missile technicians, a German in Drax's employ who publicly shot Tallon after loudly telling him ""I love Gala Brand. You shall not have her."" The episode is curious because Gala has reported that Tallon, much older than she and happily married, had never shown any romantic interest in her during the months they worked together.
Because Bond sees Gala's personnel file during his preparatory briefing, we (and he) have the unique opportunity in this case to have a clinical description of a Bond Girl's appearance, including her hair color (auburn), eye color (blue), height (5'7"") measurements (38-26-38), weight (9 stone, or 126 pounds), and beauty marks (a mole on the upper curvature of her right breast). When Bond meets her in person at Drax's house, he finds her, in contrast to her file photograph, attractive to the point of outright seductiveness, but cool to the point of frigidity and utterly disdainful of any of his attempts even to talk to her. After months undercover as Drax's secretary, Gala has become entirely devoted to the project's success, and she sees Bond as an interloper and treats him as such.
Along with seeing her official file, we also have the rare treat of overhearing some of Gala's thoughts about Bond. A dedicated policewoman, she sees Bond as a sort of playboy-adventurer of the stereotypical secret-agent sort dreamed up by writers of thrillers and not a real detective, doubting that he can be of any use on the project. Nevertheless, she admittedly finds him very handsome and, like Vesper Lynd before her, she sees a resemblance to Hoagy Carmichael. Despite Bond's attractiveness, however, she takes a dim view of him, and she lets him know this by ignoring him as much as possible.
During a walk on the beach below the Moonraker's silo to check security arrangements around the exhaust tunnel, however, Gala begins to open up somewhat to Bond. When he suggests a swim, she rather coyly gives in and strips down to her underwear out of Bond's sight. While she is swimming, Bond leaps out of the water next to her and kisses her before she realizes what is happening. Furious, she nevertheless finds herself excited and her aloofness soon vanishes. Later, the two lie on the beach to dry, still largely undressed, when an explosion buries them in rubble, nearly killing them both. Bond manages to pull the debris from Gala and the two return to Drax's house.
Later, when driving with Drax to London, Gala employs her skills as a pickpocket to sneak a look at the Moonraker's gyroscope settings, discovering to her horror that they will cause the Moonraker to hit London. At that moment she intuits that Drax plans to put an atomic warhead on the rocket, but before she can report what she has learned, Drax and her henchmen discover that she is a policewoman and knock her out. Because she had agreed to meet Bond in London for dinner, Bond grows suspicious when she fails to appear and at Drax's city house spots Drax's henchman stuffing Gala into the back seat of Drax's car. Bond chases Drax but is knocked out and captured when he wrecks during the chase.
After Drax interrogates Bond and Gala, Bond uses a blowtorch with his mouth to burn through the wires restraining Gala. The pain is terrible, but as he recovers she kisses him, her eyes shining. Gala reprograms the missile to fall into the North Sea, and the two hide in a close embrace in an exhaust duct as Drax's men search for them. Then, as the missile launches, they embrace again under a running shower adjacent to the silo in an attempt to survive the missile exhaust. The missile explodes in the North Sea, killing Drax and his men.
Bond arranges to meet Gala the following day after their debriefings. Gala is to receive the George Cross (Bond's service discourages the awarding of decorations), and the two are under orders to leave England for a month as part of the cover-up of what really happened with the Moonraker. Bond is in St James's Park delightedly planning his month with Gala when she arrives. She looks very beautiful, but he immediately senses that this beauty is intended for someone else. Nervously, she points out a young man a hundred yards away, identifying him as her fiancé and telling Bond that she is to be married the following afternoon.
Bond, tasting the bitterness of failure, is angry with himself for supposing Gala's ring and her story about being engaged to have been a fabrication. He realizes, however, that he needs to relieve her of any awkward feelings about his interest in her. He rather playfully tells her that he is envious and that he had other plans for her the following night, and, laughing in relief, she assures him that there are many other women waiting for him. The two part amicably, and Bond recedes regretfully back into his cold existence.
Gala is remembered by Bond, and is mentioned as being married as Mrs. Vivian with three kids in Richmond, Virginia. Bond exchanges Christmas cards with her, but he has not seen her again since the Moonraker incident.
Gala is the most professional of all of Fleming's Bond Girls, being practically the only one to have an independent career. In this she is like Dr. Holly Goodhead of the film, who is the first cinematic Bond girl to have a job that is not related to an intelligence service. Unlike Holly Goodhead, though, and despite her interlude with Bond on the beach, Gala is also the only one who rebuffs Bond and who clearly belongs to another. The concluding scene in the novel gives us a view of Bond as a Byronic figure of whom we see occasional glimpses in other Fleming novels.
Practically alone of all major Bond Girls of the Fleming canon, Gala Brand has not appeared as a character in a James Bond film, the movie version of the novel being an almost total rewrite of the book Moonraker. The only other Bond girl of the Fleming novels to share this fate is Vivienne Michel of the novel The Spy Who Loved Me. However, actress Rosamund Pike, in the DVD commentary for the 2002 Bond film, Die Another Day, states that her character, Miranda Frost, was originally to have been named Gala Brand, but that this was changed at the last minute.

922,/wiki/007_James_Bond:_The_Stealth_Affair,"James Bond (John Glames in Europe), a Central Intelligence Agency secret agent, has been assigned a mission to locate a newly designed high-tech F-19 type stealth plane in Latin America, which was stolen from NAS Miramar. Bond flies to Santa Paragua and upon discovering more favorable diplomatic conditions towards Germany, fabricates a German passport using a forging device hidden in his briefcase and passes through customs. Bond collects a telegram, prompting him to collect baggage containing a recording device disguised as an electric razor, instructing him to meet his contact at Las Mimosas Park. Bond takes a taxi downtown and meets with his contact, who is promptly murdered in a drive-by shooting – passing Bond a key to a safety deposit box with his dying breath. Opening the box at the city bank, 007 discovers an identical attaché case to his own and unlocks its trick compartment, discovering documents entitled “Operation Stealth” inside. He is jumped by two armed men - Colonel Karpov and Ostrovitch, his ‘contact’ from the park - who reveal that his real contact is dead and the ‘assassination’ was staged to gain access to his briefcase’s hidden contents. The Russians take him to a cave, bind him with rope and collapse the entrance with a bomb after leaving. Bond finds a pickaxe, cuts his bonds and escapes via an underwater tunnel.
Emerging in the city, he heads to his suite in the Manigua Excelsior Hotel, only to be held at gunpoint by a Julia Manigua, niece of the President and a resistance fighter belonging to the Movement for the Liberation of Santa Paragua, who has mistaken 007 for Otto. Otto confronts both with armed guards and takes them captive. During the dead of night he has both tied to rocks and thrown overboard his ship. After loosening his bonds with a bracelet, the pair narrowly escape to the surface and are rescued by Julia’s associate, Tonio.
Bond teams up with the resistance, who seek to unmask an impostor posing as her uncle. With the president organizing a show at the Palace, they decide to infiltrate disguised as performers; hoping to locate the real President.
Originally released in Europe as Operation Stealth, the game was later upgraded and released in the US as an official 007 title named James Bond: The Stealth Affair. Both variants feature a point-and-click style of gameplay reminiscent of many of the LucasArts adventures of the time, as well as a number of more action-oriented elements including an overhead viewed maze section and a scene in which Bond attempts to escape from an underwater cavern before he runs out of oxygen. The Stealth Affair is most notable for its change of protagonists from John Glames to James Bond, but also featured gameplay alterations, with the number of tunnel/maze sections halved, the introduction of skippable cut-scenes, and dialog changes; fixing some of translation errors that were present in the original Operation Stealth.
The cracked Amiga version of the game featured a primitive synthesized voice that would perform all the dialogue in the game if 1MB or more RAM was installed. Unfortunately the crack featured a bug which meant that if the player attempted to click the mouse button in order to skip through the speech faster the game would freeze and have to be rebooted. For this reason many seasoned players would actually remove the memory expansion before playing the game for any extended period of time.

924,/wiki/Count_Lippe_(Literary),"Count Lippe is described as an extremely handsome womanizer and killer. He has brown hair, is athletic-looking, roughly six foot, and has certain features that suggest he may be Spanish or from South America. Based on stories that Lippe tells the staff at Shrublands, Bond assumes he is of Portuguese blood and is probably from Macau.
Lippe first meets Bond outside of the Shrublands health farm when he pulls up in a Bentley and nearly hits Patricia Fearing who is saved by James Bond's quick reaction. Lippe is later seen by Bond arguing with a Shrublands' masseur who requests that Lippe remove his wrist-watch while receiving a massage. When Lippe reluctantly does so, Bond notices that it was being used to cover a tattoo in red that he learns was the sign of the Red Lightning Tong. Lippe overhears Bond's phone conversation in which he is informed of the symbol and later attempts to kill Bond by turning up the power on a traction table that Bond is using. After being saved by Fearing, Bond retaliates against Lippe by trapping him in a steam bath and turning up the heat. Consequently, Lippe suffers second-degree burns and is hospitalized for a week.
In the second Young Bond novel by Charlie Higson, Blood Fever, Count Lippe's father is mentioned as a guest in attendance at the villain's dinner party. His father is named as ""Count Armando Lippe from Lisbon,"" however, the last name of Lippe only appears in the UK edition. In the U.S. edition he is simply ""Count Armando from Lisbon"" for unknown reasons.

926,/wiki/Bryan_Masters,"Bryan Masters was a fictional psychiatric patient and enforcer working for Serbian scientist, Slaven Kurjak. The character served as a henchman in Dynamite Entertainment's first James Bond comic arc, Vargr, which ran between 4th November 2015 and 6th April 2016.
Held in a secure institution, Masters was an extremely violent psychiatric patient who suffered from chronic chemical anhedonia; a neurological condition which rendered him unable to experience or process pleasure in any way. At some point he escaped the facility, presumably assisted by his subsequent employer, scientist Slaven Kurjak. While attempting to find a cure for his condition, Kurjak weaponized Masters — using him as a private assassin. During his time at Kurjak's medical firm (Kurjak Medizin) in Germany, Masters met fellow-enforcer and amputee, Dharma Reach, and began a romantic relationship with her.
During the mid-2010s, Kurjak began experimenting on the British population — smuggling tainted illegal drugs into the country. MI6 sent James Bond to shut down the operation. After two failed attempts to kill the spy via Reach and the Al-Zein gang, Kurjak dispatched Mr. Masters, accompanied by Reach, to assassinate Bond and the staff of MI6's Berlin intelligence station. While unable to locate Bond, the station massacre provided the dysfunctional Masters with fleeting amorous feelings; which ultimately went nowhere, much to both his and Reach's despair. Later that evening, Masters located Bond and, posing as station staff, encouraged him to come with him to Kurjak Medizin; ostensibly to use the CIA-affiliated location to report the massacre, which Masters blamed on Al-Zein. On arriving Bond found the staff murdered and, his suspicions piqued, reached for his firearm. He was immediately countered by Masters and the pair violently brawled through the laboratories. The fight culminated with 007 injecting a syringe of the hormone oxytocin into Masters; which his body was incapable of processing. Bond threatened him with more and, after he divulged the location of Kurjak's drug foundry, injected Masters with a massive overdose of the hormone, killing him.

930,/wiki/Fear_Face,"Fear Face was a series of comic strips that ran in The Daily Express newspapers in the United Kingdom between January 18 and April 20, 1971. The series was subsequently licensed by Swedish publisher, Semic Press, who published their translation of the story in 1972, titled ""Stålspionen"" (Steel Spy). In April 2006, the original story was reprinted by Titan Books alongside three other James Bond comics strips in their paperback compilation, The Golden Ghost.
A man reported to the Police that he witnessed a nightclub dancer be murdered by a metal man. Meanwhile, Briony Thorne, much to MI6's alarm ,returned to England after having been expelled from the 00 Agent program for being a spy for Chinese Communists. James Bond returned to his apartment to find Thorne there waiting for him. Briony swore to Bond that she was framed, and rather than selling out two agents in Honk Kong, they were all captured, but she was sold to Italians who smuggled her to Rome under hypnotic drugs to frame her. Bond then flipped a coin to decide weather or not to believe her, and she gave him two names she heard, Magnus Mining, and Lambert. Bond then visited Sir William Magnus, owner of Magnus Mining, who feigned being ignorant of any involvement with spies, aside from the fortune connected with three recent ore strikes, and denied knowing a ""Lambert"", whom Miss Moneypenny discovered to be Ivor Lambert, an engineer and suspect in the recent murder of a stripper. Bond then visited Special Branch for information and learned that the murderer was at one point suspected to be a robot, tied with Lambert's connections to Technotron, LTD. Meanwhile, a bearded man, that was later revealed to be a robot, broke into Magnus Mining, and blew up the executive offices. Bond then learned that At Technotron, Lambert had been involved in creating a system to remotely control robots using one's body. Bond returned to his home to tel Briony, but found that Bill Tanner had infiltrated it on M's orders, and planned to turn them both in. Bond knocked Tanner out and left him in the apartment while he and Briony went to see Ivor Lambert. At Lambert's home they discovered that he is in league with the leader of the gang that kidnapped Briony, Ferenc Kress. Kress is selling a video-tape, recorded from the robot's vision at the Magnus Mining heist, and planned to sell it back to Magnus for 100,000 pounds, but now planned to auction it off to other mining firms. Bond was able to break free from his bonds, and subdue the three parties long enough to call MI6 about the whole situation. After a full-scale investigation, Briony was re-instated as Agent 0013.

932,/wiki/Craig_Mitchell,"Craig Mitchell was the fictional personal bodyguard of MI6 Head, M, and secretly an operative of the criminal organization, Quantum. A minor antagonist portrayed by stuntman Glenn Foster, the character appeared in the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace. He would later feature in the tie-in video game of the same name, re-named Henry Mitchell and voiced by American actor Fred Tatasciore.
Craig Mitchell worked for the head of the British Secret Service, M, for eight years; five of which were spent as her personal bodyguard. Despite passing a full security check and lie detector test every year, the MI6 operative was, in reality, secretly working for the criminal organization, Quantum. He accompanies M to a safe-house in Siena, Italy, where Quantum enforcer Mr. White is being prepared for interrogation, following his abduction by James Bond. Bond meets with M and greets Mitchell, who acknowledges him by name. During their discussion, the bodyguard excuses himself to check the perimeter; during which time he secretly murders an agent tasked with guarding the entrance. He returns a minute later to report that all is clear.
As the interrogation commences, White appears amused by MI6's obliviousness to Quantum's existence and informs her that his organization has operatives planted everywhere. White looks to Mitchell, who draws his weapon and kills the security guard present. In the chaos, Bond attempts to wrestle the weapon out of Mitchell's hand, causing a shot to discharge and hit White in the shoulder. The traitor eventually gains the upper hand, knocking Bond to the ground and flees through a tunnel system, emerging in the middle of Siena's Palio Horse Race. Pushing through the crowds, Mitchell snaps off several shots behind him, killing an innocent bystander. Eventually the chase leads to the rooftops, concluding with a climactic struggle atop a bell tower. The two men lose their footing and fall through the glass ceiling of an adjacent building. Frantically, they attempt to recover their dropped weapons, but 007 reacts quicker and shoots first, killing the bodyguard.
Later, Bond meets M at Mitchell's apartment in London. MI6 have been forensically examining the flat for evidence, but find nothing aside from some marked notes connected tenuously with a hitman named Edmund Slate. A frustrated M laments that he ""didn't leave so much as a scrap of paper to explain any of it"". Among his personal affects, she found an ashtray and three other Christmas presents she had bought him, suggesting a close working relationship between the pair. Among other details of the man's life, Tanner notes that he had no living family and gave generously to charity.
In the video game adaptation of Quantum of Solace, the character, now named Henry Mitchell and code-named 'Sleeper One', is present at the interrogation of Mr. White. He is phoned by Tanner and confirms that White is captive and about to be interrogated; as with the film, the interrogation is terminated by Mitchell's sudden intervention and 007 gives chase through the Roman tunnel system. Unlike the film, he is aided in his attempted escape by numerous squads of Quantum mercenaries. In all variants of the game, the chase concludes by both men falling through the glass ceiling of a building and results in a quick time event where the pair duel to the death. In the PC, X-Box 360, PS3 and Wii versions Bond deflects a blow from a pipe-wielding Mitchell, grabbing the implement and striking him with it, knocking him from scaffolding to his death on the floor below. In the PS2 variant, the two duel across each scaffolding platform until they reach the floor, where Bond reaches his fallen sidearm first. When Mitchell attempts to grab his pistol, 007 kills him.

933,/wiki/Comic_strip,"The Daily Express is a tabloid newspaper that began publication in 1900, with a Sunday edition under the name ""The Sunday Express"" was launched in 1918. In 1958, the paper began to run a comic strip based based on the James Bond property, written by Anthony Hern, Henry Gammidge, Peter O'Donnell and Jim Lawrence over the run of the series. The series was illustrated by John McLusky and Yaroslav Horak. Starting in 1958 and continuing to 1983, 007 appeared in 52 comic strips that were syndicated in British newspapers, 7 of which were published abroad.
In 1957 the Daily Express, a newspaper owned by Lord Beaverbrook, approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips. Ian Fleming at the time was reluctant to allow this because he felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing and could potentially hurt his series while he was still authoring them. Ian Fleming wrote:
Regardless, Fleming later agreed and the first strip Casino Royale was published in 1958. The story was adapted by Anthony Hern who had previously serialized Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia with Love for the Daily Express. The illustrations of the strip were done by John McLusky who would later go on to illustrate 12 more James Bond comic strips with partner Henry Gammidge until 1966.
To aid the Daily Express in illustrating James Bond, Ian Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of what he believed James Bond to look like. John McLusky, however, felt that Fleming's 007 looked too ""outdated"" and ""pre-war"" and thus changed Bond to give him a more masculine look.
The majority of the early strips were adapted by Henry Gammidge, however the adaptation of Dr. No was handled by Peter O'Donnell, a couple of years before he launched his legendary strip, Modesty Blaise.
In 1962 the Daily Express abruptly cancelled their agreement with Ian Fleming when a dispute between Lord Beaverbrook and Fleming erupted over the rights to the short story The Living Daylights. Fleming had sold the rights to the Sunday Times, a rival newspaper which upset Beaverbrook to the point of terminating his relationship with Fleming. The dispute caused the comic strip adaptation of Thunderball to come to an abrupt end. Thunderball was actually never finished; however, a few additional panels were later added for syndication in other newspapers to expand and conclude the story. Lord Beaverbrook and Ian Fleming would later work out their differences and the comic strip serial would continue in 1964 with On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
In 1966 Yaroslav Horak replaced John McLusky as the artist for the Daily Express comic strip series and adapted six more Ian Fleming James Bond novels and short stories as well as Kingsley Amis' Colonel Sun with partner Jim Lawrence. The Living Daylights was also republished in the Daily Express after first appearing in the first edition of the Sunday Times magazine on February 4, 1962 and in the American magazine Argosy in June of the same year under the title ""Berlin Escape.""
In 1977 the Daily Express discontinued their series of Bond comic strips, although Horak and Lawrence went on to write and illustrate several other James Bond adventures for syndication abroad in Europe, for the Sunday Express (the Sunday edition of the Daily Express), and the Daily Star. Additionally, John McLusky returned to team up with Jim Lawrence for five comic strips.
The 1983 strip Polestar was abruptly terminated by the Daily Star midway through its run and was not completed, although the complete story did appear in non-UK newspapers and was followed by several more complete serials before the James Bond comic strip officially came to an end.
Since first publication in the Daily Express, the comic strip adaptations have been reprinted several times. First by the James Bond 007 International Fan Club, in the early 1980s. Then annually, from 1987 to 1990, by the British Titan Books company in anthologies, beginning with The Living Daylights to tie-in with the release of the eponymous James Bond film.
Beginning in 2004, Titan reissued these anthologies in larger, revised editions, and also began reprinting stories that hadn't been featured in the earlier books. With a more frequent publishing schedule than the first series, to date seven books have been released with more scheduled. These volumes include new introductory chapters on the history of the strip and the Bond novels, and most of the books have also included special introductions written by Bond film actors, specifically Caroline Munro (The Spy Who Loved Me), George Lazenby (OHMSS), Shirley Eaton (Goldfinger), Eunice Gayson (Dr. No), Roger Moore (Casino Royale), Maud Adams (Octopussy) and Britt Ekland (Colonel Sun). Titan's comic strip reprints were not initially published in the strips' original publication order; this changed as of the release of the The Spy Who Loved Me volume.
The Harpies, included in The Spy Who Loved Me, is the first non-Fleming-based Bond comic strip to be reprinted as well as the first original story. River of Death, in the Colonel Sun collection, is the second original story to be published (Colonel Sun itself being an adaptation of the first post-Fleming Bond novel). The Golden Ghost, announced for an April 2006 release, is the first collection comprising all-original stories. By 2011 they had released each of the Daily Express strips in paperback form, and in 2015 they began to publish the strips based upon Fleming's work in large hardcover editions.

Attempting to identify Patrice, MI6 analysed shrapnel fragments of the rare ammunition found lodged in 007's shoulder. 
In the video game Nightfire, a modified Glock 17 with burst fire function stands in for the Glock 18. Despite being named the ""Kowloon Type 40"" (Kowloon is an urban area in Hong Kong, indicating the weapon is supposed to be a Chinese clone), the name ""Glock 17"" is written on the side.

A minor character portrayed by Italian actress, Olga Bisera, she briefly appeared in the 1977 James Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me, and was subsequently adapted for Christopher Wood's accompanying novelisation.
The gorgeous Felicca works as a low-ranked assistant to Aziz Fekkesh in Cairo, Egypt. She meets James Bond when he visits Fekkesh in Egypt. She has orders to entertain and distract him and she does just that. Bond is naturally suspicious of Felicca, but she soon has him enjoying the moment. She asks if “there is anything she can do for him….anything at all?” Bond replies, “Well, I had lunch, but I seemed to have missed desert”. The woman is apparently attracted to 007 as well and allows herself to get a little bit of pleasure during her work.
At this he takes her in his arms and the two begin kissing sensually. Felicca seems to really enjoy it and probably wants to go further in the bed, but as the two are kissing, she sees an assassin named Sandor in an above window with a gun. Sandor is about to shoot Bond. Felicca panicks and screams to beg the shooter to not kill them. Thanks to that, Bond spins just in time, and Sandor kills Felicca instead, the poor woman being used as a human shield. Bond allows her body to fall to the bed as he goes after Sandor.
This is the last time we see Felicca, and from the shot and the look at her body, it is obvious she did not survive the gun shot. In a few seconds, she met a man that she didn't know before, she kissed him and she lost her life because of him.

Above 5000 rpm customers also complained about excessive vibration, with a tendency to weave above 90 mph (140 km/h). A useful feature was an 'emergency starting' key position for times when the battery was flat to connect the alternator current directly to the ignition coils.

946,/wiki/Dario_(Benicio_del_Toro),"Dario was a fictional henchman and one of the Sanchez Cartel's three main personal henchmen alongside Braun and Perez; serving as the youngest of the three. He is a major antagonist in the 1989 James Bond film Licence to Kill, portrayed by famous actor Benicio del Toro, and also appeared in John Gardner's accompanying novelisation. Still portrayed by del Toro, the character would later be re-imagined for Activision's 2012 James Bond video game 007 Legends.
Dario is the youngest of Franz Sanchez's three main henchmen (the others being Perez and Braun) and arguably his favorite. A ruthless and psychotic killer, Dario was kicked out of the Nicaraguan Contras for his brutality and found his way into Sanchez's drug cartel as one of his chief enforcers.
Dario was present alongside Sanchez when the latter caught his mistress, Lupe Lamora, sleeping with another man in Florida. Sanchez ordered Dario to give Lupe the man's heart and the enforcer complied by cutting out the heart with his switchblade knife. Dario later escaped into hiding when Sanchez was arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Dario later resurfaces after Sanchez is liberated from U.S. custody by Ed Killifer and Milton Krest. Surprising them on their wedding night, the drug lord has Dario, Braun and Perez kidnap Felix Leiter and murder his wife Della. He is also culpable in the subsequent maiming of Felix by a shark.
Later on, Dario tries to assassinate one of Leiter's contacts, CIA informant Pam Bouvier, under the guise of hiring her for a job due to her piloting skills. However, the intervention of James Bond disrupts Dario's plans, leading to a bar-room brawl. As Bouvier and Bond flee on a boat moored outside, Dario shoots her in the back and grins to himself sadistically, unaware that she was wearing a kevlar vest underneath her blouse.
Dario makes his final appearance by attending a tour of Sanchez's cocaine processing plant with Bond and a group of Asian investors. Attending the meeting, he notices the undercover spy and covertly holds him at gunpoint during the laboratory demonstrations, pressing a Walther P5 into his spine. His suspicions about Bond's presence are confirmed when Bond sets the lab on fire.
On Sanchez's orders, Dario binds Bond's ankles and wrists with rope and places him on a conveyor belt that drops cocaine bricks into a grinding machine to be mixed with gasoline. After Sanchez leaves, Bond manages to grab hold of the edge, prompting Dario to cut his ropes in order to shove him in. Before he can do so, he is distracted by the sight of Pam Bouvier (whom he believes to be dead) saying ""Ha! You're dead!"", who shoots at him, replying back ""You took the words right out of my mouth."", knocking him off his feet. Her gun jams and as he attempts to get back up laughing, but Bond grabs him by his feet and pulls him into the grinder. Dario manages to grab onto Bond and screams for Sanchez to stop the machine but he is caught by the grinder, which slowly and agonizingly pulls him in, killing him in around ten seconds.
Dario appears in the video game 007 Legends alongside Franz Sanchez. Still portrayed by Benicio del Toro, Dario takes part in the battle in his boss's refinery except that his last appearance is not the same as in the film. Instead of being simply crushed by wanting to detach Bond, he attacks Bond to defend Sanchez who then orders him to kill both Bond and Bouvier. The player must then face Dario until he strikes him over a barrier and falls into the grinder.

948,/wiki/Comic_Strips,"The Daily Express is a tabloid newspaper that began publication in 1900, with a Sunday edition under the name ""The Sunday Express"" was launched in 1918. In 1958, the paper began to run a comic strip based based on the James Bond property, written by Anthony Hern, Henry Gammidge, Peter O'Donnell and Jim Lawrence over the run of the series. The series was illustrated by John McLusky and Yaroslav Horak. Starting in 1958 and continuing to 1983, 007 appeared in 52 comic strips that were syndicated in British newspapers, 7 of which were published abroad.
In 1957 the Daily Express, a newspaper owned by Lord Beaverbrook, approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips. Ian Fleming at the time was reluctant to allow this because he felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing and could potentially hurt his series while he was still authoring them. Ian Fleming wrote:
Regardless, Fleming later agreed and the first strip Casino Royale was published in 1958. The story was adapted by Anthony Hern who had previously serialized Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia with Love for the Daily Express. The illustrations of the strip were done by John McLusky who would later go on to illustrate 12 more James Bond comic strips with partner Henry Gammidge until 1966.
To aid the Daily Express in illustrating James Bond, Ian Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of what he believed James Bond to look like. John McLusky, however, felt that Fleming's 007 looked too ""outdated"" and ""pre-war"" and thus changed Bond to give him a more masculine look.
The majority of the early strips were adapted by Henry Gammidge, however the adaptation of Dr. No was handled by Peter O'Donnell, a couple of years before he launched his legendary strip, Modesty Blaise.
In 1962 the Daily Express abruptly cancelled their agreement with Ian Fleming when a dispute between Lord Beaverbrook and Fleming erupted over the rights to the short story The Living Daylights. Fleming had sold the rights to the Sunday Times, a rival newspaper which upset Beaverbrook to the point of terminating his relationship with Fleming. The dispute caused the comic strip adaptation of Thunderball to come to an abrupt end. Thunderball was actually never finished; however, a few additional panels were later added for syndication in other newspapers to expand and conclude the story. Lord Beaverbrook and Ian Fleming would later work out their differences and the comic strip serial would continue in 1964 with On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
In 1966 Yaroslav Horak replaced John McLusky as the artist for the Daily Express comic strip series and adapted six more Ian Fleming James Bond novels and short stories as well as Kingsley Amis' Colonel Sun with partner Jim Lawrence. The Living Daylights was also republished in the Daily Express after first appearing in the first edition of the Sunday Times magazine on February 4, 1962 and in the American magazine Argosy in June of the same year under the title ""Berlin Escape.""
In 1977 the Daily Express discontinued their series of Bond comic strips, although Horak and Lawrence went on to write and illustrate several other James Bond adventures for syndication abroad in Europe, for the Sunday Express (the Sunday edition of the Daily Express), and the Daily Star. Additionally, John McLusky returned to team up with Jim Lawrence for five comic strips.
The 1983 strip Polestar was abruptly terminated by the Daily Star midway through its run and was not completed, although the complete story did appear in non-UK newspapers and was followed by several more complete serials before the James Bond comic strip officially came to an end.
Since first publication in the Daily Express, the comic strip adaptations have been reprinted several times. First by the James Bond 007 International Fan Club, in the early 1980s. Then annually, from 1987 to 1990, by the British Titan Books company in anthologies, beginning with The Living Daylights to tie-in with the release of the eponymous James Bond film.
Beginning in 2004, Titan reissued these anthologies in larger, revised editions, and also began reprinting stories that hadn't been featured in the earlier books. With a more frequent publishing schedule than the first series, to date seven books have been released with more scheduled. These volumes include new introductory chapters on the history of the strip and the Bond novels, and most of the books have also included special introductions written by Bond film actors, specifically Caroline Munro (The Spy Who Loved Me), George Lazenby (OHMSS), Shirley Eaton (Goldfinger), Eunice Gayson (Dr. No), Roger Moore (Casino Royale), Maud Adams (Octopussy) and Britt Ekland (Colonel Sun). Titan's comic strip reprints were not initially published in the strips' original publication order; this changed as of the release of the The Spy Who Loved Me volume.
The Harpies, included in The Spy Who Loved Me, is the first non-Fleming-based Bond comic strip to be reprinted as well as the first original story. River of Death, in the Colonel Sun collection, is the second original story to be published (Colonel Sun itself being an adaptation of the first post-Fleming Bond novel). The Golden Ghost, announced for an April 2006 release, is the first collection comprising all-original stories. By 2011 they had released each of the Daily Express strips in paperback form, and in 2015 they began to publish the strips based upon Fleming's work in large hardcover editions.

952,/wiki/Hawkins,"Hawkins is a fictional DEA operative and associate of Felix Leiter. He appears in the 1989 James Bond film Licence to Kill, portrayed by actor Grand L. Bush, and also appeared in John Gardner's accompanying novelization.
After Central American drug lord, Franz Sanchez, is spotted in the Bahamas, the DEA send Hawkins and his fellow operative Mullens to notify and collect Felix Leiter in Key West. After interrupting his wedding day by flagging down his car from a helicopter, Leiter and his best man, James Bond (ostensibly, as an ""observer""), travel to a airfield where Sanchez is attempting to make his escape. After Sanchez takes to the air in a stolen Beechcraft 18, the agents pursue him by helicopter and hook his aircraft in mid-flight, taking him into custody. He is present during the drug lord's subsequent interrogation and physically restrains his colleague Ed Killifer when he lunges for Sanchez.
Hawkins later attempts to phone Leiter at his home, but instead gets through to Bond, who has discovered that the recently escaped Sanchez has maimed Felix and murdered his wife Della. He phones for an ambulance and later visits Bond at the hospital, where he informs the spy that Sanchez has fled the U.S. and is now outside their jurisdiction. Bond suggests that there are 'other ways' to get to Sanchez, but the frustrated DEA agent promptly orders him to 'let it go'. Later, Hawkins intercepts Bond near the Ernest Hemingway Home and discusses 007's recent break-in to the warehouse where Leiter was maimed; including his killing of two armed guards and causing the death of the traitorous Killifer. He informs him that he is concerned with Bond's violation of U.S. law and can only cover for him so much; the police and District Attorney want to know what happened. Bond storms off, only to be confronted by two armed Secret Intelligence Service men, who usher him into the Hemingway House for an audience with M.

953,/wiki/Eurocopter_AS355_Ecureuil_2,"The Eurocopter AS355 Ecureuil 2 is a twin-engined utility helicopter manufactured by France-based manufacturer Eurocopter (after several changes now a part of Airbus). The Ecureuil 2 is featured in the 1997 James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, where it belongs to Elliot Carver.
It is entirely based on the Aérospatiale AS355 F2 Ecureuil 2, as Aérospatiale was merged into the Eurocopter group in 1992, with this model being continued, although under the new Eurocopter name.
In the movie, the helicopter is first used to take James Bond and Wai Lin to Carver's Saigon skyscraper, and later by Carver's henchmen to chase down Bond and Wai Lin, who try to escape captivity on a motorcycle.
The chase does not end well for the helicopter; Bond throws a washing line into the tail rotor, causing the aircraft to crash into a nearby building, exploding and killing everyone on board.
Since no tail numbers are visible, it is not known which individual aircraft was used for the filming.
"
954,/wiki/Fort_Knox,"The United States Bullion Depository, often known as Fort Knox, is a fortified vault building located adjacent to Fort Knox, Kentucky, used to store a large portion of United States official gold reserves and occasionally other precious items belonging or entrusted to the federal government. The location was featured prominently in the 1959 Ian Fleming novel Goldfinger and its 1964 movie adaptation. It subsequently appeared in the video-games GoldenEye: Rogue Agent (2004) and 007 Legends (2012).
The United States Bullion Depository holds 4,578 metric tons (5,046.3 short tons) of gold bullion (147.2 million oz. troy). This is roughly 3 percent of all the gold ever refined throughout human history. Even so, the depository is second in the United States to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's underground vault in Manhattan, which holds 7,000 metric tons (7,716 tons) of gold bullion (225.1 million oz. troy), some of it in trust for foreign nations, central banks and official international organizations.
In the 1959 Ian Fleming novel Goldfinger, the titular villain, Auric Goldfinger plots to break into the U.S. Bullion Depository in a criminal plot called ""Operation Grand Slam"". With the help of several gangsters (including the Spangled Mob and the Mafia) Goldfinger plans to kill the inhabitants of Fort Knox by poisoning their water supply and then steal the gold. Bond manages to conceal a capsule containing a message to Felix Leiter into the toilet of Goldfinger's private plane, where he hopes it will be found and sent to Pinkertons, where his friend and ex-counterpart Felix Leiter now works. Operation Grand Slam commences, and it turns out that Leiter has indeed found and acted on Bond's message. A battle commences, but Goldfinger escapes.
In the 1964 movie adaptation of Goldfinger, the audience is initially led to believe Goldfinger is going to steal the gold, but the real plot is to render the gold contained in the Depository radioactive and useless with a nuclear device, crippling the economy and driving up the price of the gold Goldfinger already owns. Operation Grand Slam begins with Pussy Galore's Flying Circus spraying gas over Fort Knox. However, Bond had previously convinced her to replace the nerve gas with a harmless substance and alert the US government about Goldfinger's plan. The military personnel of Fort Knox convincingly play dead until they are certain that they can prevent the criminals from escaping the base with the bomb.
Believing the military forces to be neutralised, Goldfinger's private army breaks into Fort Knox using an industrial laser and accesses the vault itself as he arrives in a helicopter with the atomic device. In the vault, Oddjob handcuffs Bond to the device. The US troops attack; Goldfinger takes off his coat, revealing a US Army colonel's uniform, and kills Mr. Ling and the troops seeking to open the vault, before making his escape. Bond extricates himself from the handcuffs, but Oddjob attacks him before he can disarm the bomb. They fight and Bond manages to electrocute Oddjob. Bond forces the lock off the bomb, but is unable to disarm it. An atomic specialist who accompanied Leiter turns off the device with the clock stopped on ""0:07"".
Three years after an incident that claimed an unnamed 00 agent's right eye, he is evaluated through a holographic simulation in which he is paired with 007 to stop Auric Goldfinger from detonating a suitcase nuke inside Fort Knox and destabilising the global economy. During their insertion, their helicopter is shot down and crash lands through the roof of the building. Fighting his way to the vault, he fails to prevent the detonation and is held directly responsible for the ""death"" of 007, who fell from the helicopter shortly after the crash. Charged with ""reckless brutality,"" he is dismissed from MI6. As he leaves the headquarters, he is seen reading an offer by Goldfinger to enlist in his organization.
Following a similar plot to the 1964 film Goldfinger, James Bond discovers Goldfinger's plan to irradiate the United States Gold Depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky in Operation Grand Slam. Bond manages to convince Goldfinger's personal pilot, Pussy Galore, to inform the CIA, and he and the Army manage to thwart Goldfinger's scheme in the nick of time.
"
955,/wiki/Baron_Samedi,"Baron Samedi is a fictional character from the James Bond novel and film Live and Let Die. In the novel, Baron Samedi is a voodoo figure with whom Mr. Big has chosen to identify himself with to inspire fear among his followers. In the film, he was a separate character and henchman to Dr. Kananga and a major antagonist. Samedi was portrayed in the screen by the late actor, dancer, choreographer and singer Geoffrey Holder.
In the novel Live and Let Die, Baron Samedi is described as the voodoo spirit of darkness and death. No such character appears in the novel, although many people in Harlem and elsewhere believe the novel's main villain, Mr. Big, to be a manifestation of Samedi himself or perhaps his zombie. Mr. Big encourages this beneficial belief by keeping a Baron Samedi totem near his desk.
Baron Samedi is perhaps the most enigmatic villain/henchman the cinematic Bond has ever faced. The character is an ambiguous one, and the audience cannot tell if he really is the Voodoo god Baron Samedi himself, or simply a mortal who has assumed Samedi's identity. Contributing to the mystery is the fact that Samedi seems to operate as an aide to Dr. Kananga aka Mr. Big, but is not entirely under his control. In one scene, for instance, as Kananga interrogates Solitaire (the film's main Bond girl), Samedi engages in an odd ritual of burning Solitaire's Tarot cards. The ritual seems to convey a sinister message to Kananga and Solitaire, and although it irritates Kananga, he refuses to put a stop to Samedi's card-burning.
Baron Samedi is first introduced as a so-called entertainer who does a voodoo dance act for tourists, fatly laughing multiple times, when Bond arrives at the island on which most of the action takes place. The announcer introduces Samedi as an ""immortal"", though obviously neither Bond nor the viewer seem to think much of it at the time.
While on the way to Kananga's heroin fields on San Monique, Bond and Solitaire stumble across a small abbey in the woods. There, Samedi, now without makeup, coat and hat, sits on a tombstone and greets the two. He gives the appearance of a friendly native, playing a flute and telling the couple he feels it is going to be a beautiful day for them. Bond and Solitaire continue their journey and after they are out of sight, Samedi warns Kananga with a radio built into his flute, telling the drug lord that ""they're heading for the hill"".
After Bond has been captured in New Orleans and been brought to the crocodile farm, Samedi, now dressed in a black suit, meets with Kananga while the latter confronts Solitaire for her betrayal as he wants to know why she betrayed him although he gave her everything and she lacked for nothing. She tells him that the cards foresaw it. Kananga angrily smacks the medium to the ground, telling her that in proper time he would have given her love and that she knew that. The villain says that there is only one appropriate way to deal with this betrayal, to which Samedi draws the tarot card 'Death', laughing maniacally. This is then followed by Kananga also declaring there is one proper time to administer it, and on cue, Samedi draws another tarot card, this one the card 'Midnight'.
Samedi is encountered again when Kananga orders Solitaire to be executed during a voodoo ceremony, a fate that befell Baines. Though it initially seems that Solitaire is to be killed by the bite of a poisonous snake, the henchman holding the snake backs of in the last moment. A man with a hat then approaches a tombstone nearby and leaves it on the grave. After two women drag on the tombstone with a machete three times and ring a bell, Samedi rises from the grave, with the hat on his head. Samedi blinks, indicating a go-ahead for killing Solitaire. At this point Bond reveals himself and shoots Kananga's henchmen, including the one holding the snake, before cutting the ropes holding Soltaire in place.
When shooting Samedi in the head, the head simply breaks. After shooting the body multiple times it becomes clear that it wasn't the real Samedi, but just a clay figure. After fighting more henchmen, another motionless Samedi rises from either another grave or the same one as the mannequin. Bond ignores him, deeming him another impostor, but Baron Samedi then opens his eyes widely and starts to laugh. He then takes the machete from the tombstone and engages Bond in a short fight, but Bond hits him in the stomach and knocks him back, causing Samedi to fall into the coffin full of poisonous snakes, where he is bitten multiple times. Eventually Samedi falls silent and does not move anymore, and Bond believes him dead.
Bond then uses the machete to hit the tombstone three times. It is revealed that the tomb in fact is a hidden elevator, which brings Bond and Solitaire down into Kananga's underground headquarters.
But at the very end of the film, at the point when Bond typically has achieved total victory in the Bond films, we seen Baron Samedi riding on the front of the speeding train carrying him and Solitaire, laughing demonically as the camera zooms in to focus on him while the credits start playing, further suggesting that he is in fact a supernatural character, a first (and so far only, besides Solitaire) for the Bond films.
Baron Samedi has never reappeared in any subsequent Bond film, unlike the henchmen Jaws and Mr. White or the main villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld (most likely because Samedi is inseparably connected to Voodoo and Bond never had to deal with this cult again), but neither has the series endeavored to solve the mystery of Samedi's nature. Since Samedi's last appearance was more than three decades ago, the mystery will likely remain unsolved.
Samedi appears in The Duel as one of the cloned bosses in Stage 2.
In the video game, GoldenEye 007, Samedi appears as a boss in an unlockable mission separate from the main plot as well as the game's multiplayer. In the game, Bond is sent to the ancient el-Saghira temple in the Valley of the Kings in response to a letter sent by someone claiming to be Baron Samedi. Additionally, Samedi claims to have possession of Francisco Scaramanga's Golden Gun.
Bond is sent to retrieve the legendary weapon and defeat a cackling Baron a total of three times before completing the mission. In the cutscene that follows, Bond strides down a corridor of the temple with the Golden Gun in hand. Just as he is about to leave, Samedi emerges from the shadows and laughs. However, he can be killed a fourth time during the cut scene using a glitch, but this does not result in any new cut scene.
He is also a multiplayer character in the games Nightfire, Everything or Nothing, GoldenEye 007, and 007 Legends.

957,/wiki/For_Special_Services,"For Special Services, first published in 1982, was the second novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond. Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape and in the United States by McCann and Geoghegan.
In June 1941 General William Donovan was appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt to the position of Coordinator of Information (COI), a position that later transformed into the chairmanship of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Upon request by Donovan, Ian Fleming was contacted to write a lengthy memorandum describing the structure and functions of a secret service organization. Parts of this memorandum were later used in the official charter for the OSS, which was later dissolved after World War II in 1945. For appreciation of Fleming's work Donovan presented Fleming with a .38 Police Positive Colt revolver with the inscription, ""For Special Services.""
In 1944, Donovan proposed to President Roosevelt the creation of a new agency, ""which will procure intelligence both by overt and covert methods and will at the same time provide intelligence guidance, determine national intelligence objectives, and correlate the intelligence material collected by all government agencies."" This organization was later established in 1947 as the Central Intelligence Agency; a direct descendant of the OSS.
Bond teams up with CIA agent Cedar Leiter, daughter of his old friend, Felix Leiter, to investigate one Markus Bismaquer, who is suspected of reviving the criminal organization S.P.E.C.T.R.E., which was believed to have been disbanded years earlier following the death of its leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld at the hands of Bond in You Only Live Twice.
The British Secret Service learns that Bismaquer is an obsessive collector of rare prints, so Bond and Cedar visit the man's huge ranch in Amarillo, Texas posing as art dealers. Their true identities are soon revealed, but not until Bond holds his own both in an impromptu (and fixed) car race arranged by Bismaquer, and in the bed of Bismaquer's frustrated wife, Nena. Nena, who has only one breast, quickly wins Bond's heart and his sympathy and Bond is convinced that Bismaquer is the one now being referred to as the new Blofeld.
Bond discovers that the revitalised S.P.E.C.T.R.E. plans to take over control of NORAD headquarters in order to gain control of America's military space satellite network. His true identity revealed, Bond is captured and brainwashed into believing he is an American general assigned to inspect NORAD. Although he has been set up to be killed in the ensuing attack by S.P.E.C.T.R.E. forces on the base, Bond regains his personality and his memory. Apparently Bismaquer, who is bisexual, has taken a liking to Bond and sabotaged the hypnosis.
When Bond returns to Bismaquer's ranch, he witnesses Bismaquer being killed by Nena, who is in fact the mind behind the operation and the daughter of Blofeld, a fact she confesses to Bond just before falling into the crushing grip of her pet pythons. She is later put out of her misery by Felix Leiter, who arrives on the scene to help rescue his daughter.

958,/wiki/Bonita,"Bonita is a fictional young belly dancer of the El Scorpio night club. In addition, she is secretly working for major heroin smuggler Mr. Ramirez. Portrayed by the late actress Nadja Regin, the character appeared in the pre-title sequence of the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger.
Bonita is a beautiful young female belly dancer who dances the tarantella (Spanish dance) at the El Scorpio nightclub in Mexico. However, she secretly works for Mr. Ramirez, a major heroin smuggler who works nearby.
After James Bond planted explosives on Ramirez's heroin lab, he visits Bonita at the club much when she is dancing much to the delight of the men gathered around her. She wears a white and black top and bottom dress with flowing ruffled skirt.
Most of the bars customers disappear when the detonator Bond planted explodes, leaving Bonita to retire her to her room. To finish some unfinished business, Bond then follows Bonita and enters in her dressing room when is in the middle of a bath but she exits the bathtub to greet him.
It appears that Bonita and Bond know each other from a previous encounter, as the two embrace and prepare to make love. When she pulls away complaining that his gun is hurting her, Bonita then asks why he always has to wear it and Bond replies by saying that he has a slight inferiority complex. He takes the gun off, leaving himself disarmed. Bonita then double-crosses Bond by setting him up to get hit on the head as she distracts him. But Bond sees the assassin, Capungo, in Bonita's eye and quickly spins around using her as a shield to block the blow.
A fight ensues between Capungo and Bond. This fight is ended when Capungo falls into the bathtub filled with water. Bond hurls and electric fan into the water, killing him as he attemps to reach for Bond's discared Walther PPK in the holster.
Bonita survives though, but Bond leaves her lying on the floor against the wall with a severe headache, and exits with the phrase ""Shocking, just shocking."" Bonita is never seen again in the films.

959,/wiki/Eve_Moneypenny_(Naomie_Harris),"Miss Eve Moneypenny is a fictional character in the James Bond films. She is the tough and sassy secretary to M, who is Bond's boss and head of the British Secret Service.
After an absence from the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale and its 2008 sequel Quantum of Solace, 2012's Skyfall reintroduces the character for Daniel Craig's tenure as Bond; Skyfall is the first film in which the character is given a first name, Eve. She is played by Naomie Harris, the only non-White actress to portray Moneypenny. Even though she is not considered a Bond girl, she is the first Moneypenny to have romantic moments with 007.
Eve was an MI6 field agent, who during a mission with Bond in Istanbul, Turkey, spots Bond while he struggled with mercenary Patrice atop a train. M demands that Patrice be eliminated, but due to the constant movement of Bond and Patrice, Eve lacks confident she can get a good shot at Patrice. M, frustrated with such a response, bluntly orders Eve to ""take the bloody shot"". Eve does so, and ends up shooting Bond, resulting in his apparent death.
Afterwards she is placed under investigation. Although not reprimanded due to the extreme situation and M's direct order to shoot, she is suspended from field work. But, when Q refused to meet up with Bond at his hotel in Macau due to his fear of flying, Eve went instead, where she helps shave his stubble, and prevents him from unbuttoning her blouse. Later, she and Bond head to a Macau casino where Bond cashed in a chip he lifted from Patrice, containing a suitcase full of money and meets Sévérine before he drops his earpiece into Eve's champagne glass as he passed by. Eve then helped Bond incapacitate the last of one of Sévérine's bodyguards with the case, which he tells her to ""put it all on red"" before leaving to meet up with Sévérine.
Not long after Bond took Raoul Silva into custody, Eve accompanied M to an inquiry hearing, which is interrupted by a recently escaped Silva, who tries to kill M, but with the combined efforts of Bond, Gareth Mallory and herself, M was able to escape with Bond's help.
A couple of days later, after M's funeral, Eve approaches Bond, who was admiring a sunrise and states she is unfit for field work, and will now work as Mallory's executive secretary, following the former's promotion to M. Before they leave, Eve gives Bond a box containing M's Bulldog Ornament as read in her will, believing it is her way to get Bond to take a desk job. As Bond says that they have not been properly introduced, she says her full name is Eve Moneypenny.
Monneypenny helps Bond in Spectre, while he's going rogue. She tells him that The Pale King is in fact Mr. White. Later she helps Bond in London when M finds out that C is spying on all the MI6 agents. In the final act of the film she helps Bond together with the MI6-crew to capture C and Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
Following Logan Ash's killing Felix Leiter, Bond goes to M, demanding to be allowed to meet Blofeld in prison. When M refuses, Bond goes behind his back, asking Moneypenny for help instead. She takes Bond to see Q, getting his help in decrypting a flash drive that Bond seized from the villainous scientist Valdo Obruchev. With this, the group uncovers the true, horrifying scope of Project Heracles, that its nanobots can be reprogrammed to target entire races, resulting in genocide on a massive scale. They also help Bond to arrange his meeting with Blofeld.
Following Bond's death in staying behind to ensure the success of the missiles that take out Project Heracles, Moneypenny shares a drink with M, Q, Nomi and Tanner.

961,/wiki/Bibi_Dahl,"Bibi Dahl is a fictional ice-skater who appears in the 1981 James Bond film, For Your Eyes Only. She was portrayed by American ice-skater and actress, Lynn-Holly Johnson.  Bibi is the protege of Greek smuggler Aris Kristatos.
Aris Kristatos' recent financial investment, ice-skater Bibi Dahl, spends most of her days training for the upcoming Olympics with the aim and intention of walking away with the gold medal. Working to a strict training regime set by her coach, Jacoba Brink, Bibi has very little freedom in regards to spending time with those she so desires. She is blissfully unaware however, her funding is merely a front for Kristatos' double crossing nature, allowing him to appear better natured than he is.
James Bond becomes acquainted with Bibi at an ice rink in Cortina during a meeting with Kristatos; while demonstrating her captivating Olympic-calibre talents, Kristatos poses as a proud sponsor whilst telling Bond that she's innocent in the ways of the world. Kristatos introduces a tired Bibi to Bond where she immediately feels an attraction towards the double-0. Bond is at first hesitant to accept her invite to the biathlon later that day due to her younger age but accepts telling her he is staying at the Miramonte Hotel.
Arriving back at his hotel after a run in with assassins following Melina Havelock, Bond is surprised to find Bibi in his room. In his bed, naked, Bibi tells Bond the porter, a fan of hers, let her in. Bond diverts Bibi's sexual advances, once again, due to her younger age. After getting dressed the pair leave to head to the biathlon which is being held in the hills of Cortina.
After flirtatiously skiing together, Bibi takes Bond to watch East German biathlon champion Erich Kriegler, who rudely ignores her greeting; little does Bibi know, Kriegler is in fact a hitmen secretly working for Kristatos. Following the champion to watch him shoot, Bibi continues to cheer him on but is again ignored upon her advances. When Bond tells Bibi he has an appointment to attend, she asks him to say goodbye at the practice rink later that evening as he is shortly leaving for Greece.
That evening, after surviving various attacks on the hills of Cortina by assassins led by Kriegler, Bond visits Bibi at the practice rink, however with intentions of discovering more information on the mysterious German champion. Naively, Bibi tells Bond about Kriegler's personality as well as being a defector. Upon hearing Bibi discussing Kriegler, her coach, Brink, orders her to leave with her. Bibi says her farewells to Bond, hoping they aren't goodbyes.
Continuing her training at Kristatos' retreat in the mountains of Greece, Bibi has become tired of her sponsors lack of enthusiasm for her Olympic success. When Kristatos tells her he plans to move to Cuba, Bibi becomes defensive with Kristatos telling him he's too old for her and that she wants to part ways, with intentions of finding a new sponsor. Kristatos blames Brink but Bibi defends her coach too.
Shortly after, Bibi decides to leave the retreat. Packing her bags, Brink tells her she will never leave her side. When Brink joins forces with Bond, an unaware Bibi presumes Kristatos is holding her captive; confronting her sponsor, she takes a hard slap to the face after telling Kristatos to go to hell.
When Bond smashes through the window and is fought by Kriegler, Bibi attempts to assist by hitting the German hitman, but takes another hit to the face. After watching Bond defeat Kriegler, Bibi follows Bond, Melina and Columbo to confront Kristatos for the final time. After watching Columbo kill her captor, Bibi tends to Columbo's wounds. As she does this, Columbo pours money into her hands insinuating she's found a new sponsor.

963,/wiki/Ann_Reilly,"After a year of field work, Ann took a two-year technical course, which earned her the promotion to Q-Branch executive. After only a week in this position, Ann was given the nickname ""Q'ute"", a name that she found ""damn silly"".
A year in to her service, in 1981, it was Q'ute's task to equip agent 007 with the necessary equipment to infiltrate Dr. Anton Murik's Castle. She equipped him with a steel-strengthened briefcase and suitcase, both with hidden sound capturing equipment, sabotage tools, and survival items. She also gave him a pen with a distress beacon built in, a high-intensity flashlight, a replica of his Dunhill lighter that released a painful gas, as well as a set of Nitefinder goggles. Later, in an attempt to sharpen her handgun knowledge, she watches as Bond disassembles and reassembles a gun. She then asked about the mark on his hand (the surgical scar from removing the Ш left over from Casino Royale). The two went to dinner, and Ann took Bond to her apartment where she showed him her extensive hologram array that used mirrors to change a room's appearance.
Ann and Bond are established as ""close friends and occasional lovers"", and Bond was staying at her apartment when he was summoned by M to the Regent's Park building for a briefing.
By the time of the rise of the National Socialist Action Army, Q'ute had perfected the art of creating hidden screened compartments to such a degree that she was reluctant to share the secret even with other Q-Branch staff. This screening technology went into Bond's Shielded briefcase, in which he smuggled weapons and a VL34 Privacy Protector through airport customs.
During a particularly dull year and a half of Bond's life, the high point was helping Ann and Major Boothroyd test out the ASP 9mm pistol for its viability as a new standard sidearm. Shortly after, while Bond was undercover and pretending to have been ousted from the service amidst scandal, he recognized her in a local restaurant, but she pretended not to know him.
John Gardner, in his James Bond novels, introduced the character of Ann Reilly, a young female assistant to Q whose co-workers as well as Bond nicknamed Q'ute. Major Boothroyd himself was only mentioned a couple of times. During Licence Renewed and For Special Services, Q'ute and Bond maintained a brief romantic relationship. Afterwards, it was revealed a number of times that Bond and Q'ute were involved in a casual relationship. By the time Gardner left the book series, Q'ute had taken over the running of Q Branch, but when Raymond Benson took over the literary series, he ignored much of Gardner's continuum and gave Q Branch back to Major Boothroyd with no explanation and no further references to Ann Reilly.

964,/wiki/Gustav_Graves,"Founder and owner of the Graves CorporationColonel Tan-Sun Moon, later known as Sir Gustav Graves, was a fictional North Korean military colonel who attempted to unite the Korean peninsula under his county's flag. After his presumed death at the hands of James Bond, he changed his appearance to infiltrate the society he intended to destroy; becoming a charismatic diamond magnate.
Portrayed jointly by Korean-American actor, Will Yun Lee, (as Moon) and British actor, Toby Stephens, (as Graves) the character served as the main antagonist of the 2002 James Bond film, Die Another Day. He was also featured in Raymond Benson's accompanying novelisation and was re-imagined for Activision's 2012 James Bond video game, 007 Legends.
Born the son General Moon, Tan-Sun Moon was a Colonel (Sangchwa) in the North Korean People's Army. In a hope that a Western education would help bridge the gap between East and West, General Moon sent his son to study at Oxford and Harvard. It was an experience which would prove formative on the young Moon, providing him with the contacts which he would later use; including Miranda Frost who was on also on the Harvard fencing team. He was able to bring Frost to his side by arranging her to win the Olympic Gold Medal in fencing by implicating her competitor for using steroids. General Moon would later regret the decision, coming to believe that his son had become corrupted by the ideas and greed of the West.
A radical and a dealer in hi-tech weaponry, Moon conducted various illicit operations in diamond  smuggling to fund his private army and ambitions to forcibly unite the two Koreas. He had his base set up in the middle of the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. He also had assistance from a fellow Korean officer named Tang Lin Zao. MI6 becomes aware of his activities, however, and dispatches three agents, including James Bond, to assassinate Moon by intercepting and replacing a diamond smuggler named Van Bierk.
When Zao finds out that Bond is in truth a British spy sent to kill him, Moon uses to destroy the helicopter Bond arrived in with one of his high-tech weapons, called Tankbuster, killing the two remaining agents. Before he can kill Bond too, Moon is told that General Moon is about to arrive at the base. The Colonel and his men then quickly leave the base with the hovercrafts and weapons, so that his father doesn't find out about his weapon dealing. He leaves Bond to be shot by his men but the agent escapes by blowing up the diamond suitcase, having implanted a bomb earlier, and fleeing with the last remaining hovercraft. Pursuing Moon, Bond has to fight off many Korean soldiers while being shot at by Moon with his Tankbuster and a flamethrower.
Eventually jumping onto Moon's hovercraft, Bond attacks the young military and the two fight long enough for the hovercraft to reach a cliff. Without a pilot to steer it the hovercraft drives right over the cliff into the river far below. Bond is able to jump off in time, but Moon is dragged over the cliff and presumed deceased. Right after, Bond is arrested by General Moon and his soldiers, and brought to a North Korean torture camp where he is brutally interrogated for before being exchanged for Zao, who had been arrested by the British.
Unknown to the rest of the world - including his own father - Moon survives the incident and flees to Cuba, where he undergoes DNA replacement therapy (provided by Dr. Alvarez) to alter his appearance to make him appear to be of European descent. Emerging from the therapy, he completed his transformation and adopted the name Gustav Graves.
Gustav Graves was seen as a sophisticated, sarcastic, rude and arrogant business man. In a conversation with Bond later in the film, he admits that he modelled this new identity after him. He portrays himself to the world as an ecologist, fencing champion and adrenaline junkie, with a penchant for speed—activities which he has plenty of time for, given that the gene therapy has robbed him of the ability to sleep.
His official story was that he was an orphan who worked in diamond mines in Argentina; from there, he learned engineering and founded the Graves Corporation. He discovered a great mine of diamonds in Iceland and made a huge fortune. With that fortune, Graves developed Icarus - a satellite which harnesses solar energy and focuses it, ""gently"", over the Earth, supposedly putting an end to famine and poverty. In reality, his fortune was made using a fake diamond mine as a front for laundering African conflict diamonds and his Icarus satellite is a super-weapon. The main purpose of Icarus was to blast its way through the heavily-fortified demilitarized zone, providing a pathway for the invading North Korean forces and bringing about Korean unification.
Brought on Graves' trace through blood diamonds he found with Zao, Bond - unaware of Graves' true identity - travels to London, where he witnesses Graves arriving at the Buckingham Palace by parachute before he is knighted by the Queen. Later that day, Bond visits the fencing academy where Graves is training and manages to persuade the fight trainer Verity to arrange a match with Graves. When being introduced to Graves, the villain asks whether they have met before, to which Bond responds by stating he would remember. Graves admits that he is mistaking. Driven by their arrogance, both men then engage in their training match, betting money on the outcome. When Graves asks Bond if he still wants to continue, Bond proposes to up the wager, showing him one of the blood diamonds he got from Zao.
When continuing their fight, Bond cuts Graves at the hand, pausing their fight to continue. When Bond mockingly-affably asks Graves whether he wants to continue, Graves responds that of course he wants to ""bloody continue"", but proposes that they use real swords and fight till first blood drawn from the torso. They engage in a furious duel, where both men are cut multiple times. Fighting their way through the club, changing their weapons multiple times. Eventually hammering at each others with medieval claymores, they continue their fight in the outer parts of the club, with Bond finally cutting Graves at the stomach, thereby throwing him into a fountain. Graves emerges furiously but before he can continue the fight, Miranda Frost stops them. Graves laughs and admits that Bond beat him and the men shake hands. Before they leave, Graves, as a token of good sportsmanship, invites Bond to his Icarus demonstration in Iceland at the next weekend.
When Bond arrives at Graves' Ice Palace at Iceland, a palace made from pure ice only built for the demonstration of Icarus, he is greeted by Graves and his security head Mr. Kil. While the guests entertain themselves inside, Graves is using his dream machine. He is interrupted by a man who is revealed to be Zao. Seeing his old friend for the first time after Zao's departure, Graves looks at his unfinished face and asks him who did that. Zao responds that it is Bond's work and Graves gleefully tells him that he has met Bond and Bond did not recognize him at all. Graves then asks Zao of news of his father and Zao tells him that General Moon still mourns his death.
The guests are then called for the presentation. Graves then presents Icarus, telling them that it will be used to bring light to the darkest places on earth and is able to warm even the coldest places to grow crops, therefor being a mean to end world hunger. He then uses Icarus to illuminate the entire palace, causing giant applause from the guests.
When NSA agent Jinx, who has also reached Island, breaks into the complex where Graves' chambers are located to kill Graves, she expects to find him under the dream machine's mask. However, when she takes the mask off, Zao looks at her and Graves attacks her from behind, wearing the prototype of his Icarus suit.
After saving Jinx from Zao, Bond heads to Graves' office where he waits for his old enemy. When Graves arrives, Bond tells him that he knows his true identity, based on Zao's presence and the lack of alternative explanations for the dream machine's presence. Graves mocks him, telling him he thought that Bond would never get it. He then reveals to Bond that while they only met briefly, Bond had made a lasting impression on him, causing him to model his new identity Gustav Graves after the MI6 agent. Miranda then arrives, holding her weapon at Graves. Graves remarks seemingly defeated that Miranda seems to be not the one she claims to be. Bond agrees, but then Graves asks whether he has found out who betrayed him in North Korea and if it never occurred to him to look inside MI6. Miranda then aims her gun at Bond, revealing herself as the traitor. Graves also reveals that he knows of Jinx and says that a tragedy will befall her soon.
When Bond is about to be killed, Bond goads Zao into hitting him into stomach in order to allow him to fall to the ground. Using a special ring he got from MI6's quartermaster, he breaks the glass panel that covers the entire floor in order to fall into the lower floor. As Bond runs off, Graves orders Zao to follow and kill him but Bond escapes with Graves' speeder, driving off into the ice plains at insane speed. When Zao returns and tells Graves that Bond escaped, Graves decides to unleash Icarus.
He orders Zao to bring the three North Korean generals (Dong, Li & Han) that were underneath the guests and tells them that he will demonstrate them the full power of Icarus. He then has Icarus produce a gargantuan heat beam, which Bond can only escape because of his vehicle's enormous speed. When Bond drives off a cliff, hanging there only on the breaking hook of the speeder, Graves has Icarus cut off the entire cliff. Though Bond survives, Graves believes him to be dead.
Preparing to return to North Korea, Graves leaves Zao at the palace to oversee the final preparations. He, Miranda and most of his men then leave the palace, leaving Zao only with a minimal force. Returning to the palace for Jinx, Bond sees their escape plane arrive. On the plane, Graves uses Icarus to destroy his ice palace, destroying any evidence left. After this, he tells his engineer Vlad to complete the Icarus suit.
Having fled to a North Korean airbase, Graves plans to use Icarus to destroy the minefield in the demilitarized zone, allowing North Korean forces to attack the South. As General Moon wouldn't allow this war, the hardliners staged a coup and put the general under arrest. Bond and Jinx are sent to stop Graves.When the USA sends a missile to destroy Icarus, Graves uses the satellite's power to disintegrate it mid-air.
Unable to assassinate Graves at the airbase, Jinx and Bond are forced to board Graves' plane. On-board the plane, Graves and the generals are inside a planning room, where Graves admires the finished Icarus suit. He tells his men to have his father brought down. When General Moon arrives, Graves addresses him, but as his face is changed General Moon does not recognize him. When Moon tells him that he does not now him, Graves says that Moon always found it difficult to accept him, which made his exile easier to bear. He then quotes his father, which makes Moon realises that the man next to him is his son. However, he is deeply shocked, asking what his son did to himself. Graves then tells his father to watch the rising of his son and activates Icarus to destroy the minefield. However, opposed to Graves, Moon is disgusted by the heat beam as he knows this would mean war, with the Americans presumably sending nuclear warheads.
Finally realizing what his son has become, Moon grabs a gun from General Han and points it at his son's head. Graves asks his father whether he would kill his own son. When Moon claims that his son died long ago, Graves disarms him with the electricity glove of his Icarus suit and shoots him. He then sees Bond walking towards him and about to shoot him, but a henchman intervenes and the bullet hits the plane's window instead, causing it to break, sucking out everyone except Bond and Graves.
Graves and Bond then fight in the remains of the room, with Graves eventually overpowers Bond with his shock glove, Graves takes the plane's two parachutes and throws one out of the window. Intending to leave Bond to die in the plane crash, Graves kneels down next to Bond for one last gloat.
As he leans over the fallen spy to gloat, 007 reaches out and yanks the parachute's release cord; causing Graves to be pulled through a hole in the fuselage. As Moon desperately clings onto the edge of the chassis, Bond reaches out and activates the suit's electric defenses causing Moon to shock himself. He loses his grip and is sucked - along with the controls for the Icarus - into the Autonov's jet engine. With the destruction of his suit, Icarus is rendered harmless.
Gustav Graves also appears in 007 Legends in the Die Another Day mission. He has the likeness of is and voiced by Toby Stephens, but no reference is made to his past as Colonel Moon, implying that he was born Gustav Graves. The only exception to this theory is that a bust of Colonel Moon's head can be seen on Graves's cargo plane. Although he is shown wearing his North Korean uniform underneath his armor, his collar cuffs are absent.
While an original character, the character of Gustav Graves incorporates a number of elements from Ian Fleming's original novel Moonraker. In that novel, a Nazi adopts a new identity and becomes a popular British multi-millionaire. He then donates millions to create a ""Moonraker"" missile which is supposed to be for Britain's protection but is actually meant to destroy London. In addition, the club called Blades, a fencing club in this film, was featured as a gentleman's club in Moonraker. The name Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is a homage to the first official James Bond novel written after Ian Fleming's death, Colonel Sun by Robert Markham (Kingsley Amis).

965,/wiki/Happy_%26_Glorious,"Happy & Glorious (named after a line in God Save the Queen) is a short film directed by Danny Boyle and produced by the BBC that was part of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony titled Isles of Wonder that took place on July 27 in London. It features Daniel Craig as James Bond and Queen Elizabeth II as herself. It was later uploaded to the official Olympics Games YouTube channel (simply called Olympics) on the same day as the video ""James Bond and The Queen London 2012 Performance"".
James Bond enters the front gate of Buckingham Palace in a London black cab. His entrance (accompanied by an arrangement of Handel's ""The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba"") is noticed by Brazilian children (a nod to Rio de Janeiro, the next summer Games host city) in the throne room. Bond escorts Queen Elizabeth II (who played herself, acknowledging Bond with the words, ""Good evening, Mr. Bond"") out of the building and into a waiting AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter.
The helicopter flies across London, above the cheers of a crowd on The Mall, past Nelson's Column, doubling back to the Palace of Westminster with an animated Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square, and then along the Thames past the London Eye, St Paul's Cathedral, the financial district City of London (with 30 St Mary Axe in the background), and then passes through Tower Bridge, accompanied by the Dambusters March.
The film finishes with Bond and the Queen apparently jumping from a helicopter live above the stadium with Union Jack parachutes (famously used by Bond in The Spy Who Loved Me) accompanied by the James Bond Theme. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, along with Jacques Rogge, are then introduced to the audience, the Queen wearing the same dress as in the film, as if she had just arrived with Bond.
For the scenes with the helicopter, the Queen was doubled by actress Julia McKenzie, and for the parachute jump by BASE jumper and stuntman Gary Connery wearing a dress, hat, jewellery and with a handbag. Bond was played by Mark Sutton. The helicopter had flown to the stadium from Stapleford Aerodrome in Essex.
The Union Flag was then raised by members of Her Majesty's Armed Forces, while the first and third verses of the national anthem were performed a cappella by the Kaos Signing Choir for Deaf and Hearing Children.

Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. The location was featured in the console versions of Electronic Arts' 2004 video-game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent.
After repelling an attack on Auric Goldfinger's Midas casino in Las Vegas, his golden-eyed enforcer is sent to the Hoover Dam to exact revenge on Dr. Julius No's forces. The dam had been used as a staging location for the attack and is held by a small army armed with tanks, aircraft, and a seismic bomb; consequently the US security forces keep their distance to avoid Dr. No blowing up the dam. GoldenEye's task is to detonate the bomb, with the help of Pussy Galore and Oddjob, drowning Dr. No's militia. Starting at the base of the dam, GoldenEye scales the structure and makes his way inside. He reaches the Seismic bomb, which is suspended over a deep pit and triggers the release. The bomb detonates and the enforcer is almost immediately betrayed and attacked by Oddjob, whom he tosses over a rail into the pit. As the structure collapses, he makes his way to the surface where he is attacked by Dr. No's assassin, Xenia Onatopp. GoldenEye shoots down her tiltrotor fighter aircraft and the two engage in a gunfight, concluding with Onatopp falling from the top of the dam as it disintegrates.

Luludi, meaning ""Flower"", was the granddaughter of the ""Phuri Dai"", or shaman.

However, Ostep later on returned and slapped her, prompting Bond to fight him away from her. Bond bests the boy in a duel, but Botanee warns that he may regret not killing him as she brings him to her trailer to dress his wounds. There, her grandmother came and bade Botanee to read Bond's palm, and noted he had the ""mark of the wolf"" before the two began to have sex in her trailer.

As the sun rose, the Gypsies slipped into a larger military convoy, where Botanee's trailer split in two to reveal a mounted machine gun which she used to destroy the convoy along with the rest of her caravan. She turned it toward an approaching helicopter, But Bond and Gayla flew in front of it, prompting Botanee to say a quiet goodbye, wishing them luck.

A secondary antagonist portrayed by Australian actor and former professional wrestler, John Seru, he appeared in the 1999 James Bond film, The World Is Not Enough, along with its accompanying novelisation and video games.
Gabor is the personal bodyguard to oil heiress Elektra King. He is first seen in Azerbaijan, accompanying Elektra to a meeting discussing the controversial planned path of her oil pipeline. Although he doesn't exit the helicopter, he is present when she heads high into the mountains to check the survey lines with British agent James Bond. He also accompanies Elektra when they visit Valentin Zukovsky's casino where she loses a game to the Russian businessman. Gabor is then present when M visits Baku and is informed about Renard's plan to blow-up Elektra's oil refinery. At the command center, after Bond is presumed killed in the attempt to prevent the attack, Elektra reveals she and Renard are conspirators. Gabor assists her in abducting M by shooting her guards with another henchman, Elektra having held a bitter grudge against M for having influenced her father not to pay the ransom to Renard.
Later, Gabor and a group of heavies are waiting outside the Federal Security Bureau's Istanbul safe house, when Mister Bullion attempts to kill Zukovsky, Bond and Christmas Jones using a briefcase bomb. They escort 007 and Jones to their base of operations in the Maiden's Tower at the southern entrance of the Bosphorus strait. However, Zukovsky survived the bombing and leads an assault on the tower. Gabor assists in its defense, but is shot dead by Bond after the spy escapes from an antique torture device. Elektra would later suffer Gabor's fate after being shot by 007 for her refusal to call off her plot.
While the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64 editions of The World Is Not Enough vary in their story and character depictions, Gabor is consistently the 'boss' character the player confronts in the Maiden's Tower. In both versions, Gabor ambushes 007 in a scripted event, following the Istanbul safe house bombing. In the N64 version, while Bond is attempting to rescue M from the prison cells, Elektra enters, tells the spy to drop his weapons, and orders Gabor to kill him. A fist-fight in the narrow hallway ensues. The PS1 variant has Bond battling the bodyguard and his henchmen in a large, circular room. Almost indestructible, the PS1 Gabor can only be killed by utilizing the pipe bombs he hurls. He is absent from the Game Boy variant.

The Ranger is forced to the surface, where it is swallowed by the tanker. Fraser remains a prisoner on-board the Liparus until James Bond liberates the crew. His commanding officer, Talbot, leads a raid on the ship's armory and provides weapons for the newly liberated British, American and Soviet sailors. Whether he survives the fight or not is unknown.

977,/wiki/Ed_Killifer,"Ed Killifer is a fictional DEA agent and colleague of Felix Leiter, who turns traitor when he accepts a $2 million bribe to free drug baron Franz Sanchez from U.S. custody. The character appears in the 1989 James Bond film Licence to Kill, portrayed by Everett McGill, and was also featured in John Gardner's accompanying novelization.
Killifer is first introduced to James Bond at the wedding of Felix and Della Leiter. Earlier that day, Bond and Leiter captured Sanchez in American airspace, to which Killifer congratulates the pair. He is later seen in a detention center, intimidating Sanchez. Killifer mockingly remarks to Sanchez he made the mistake of setting foot in the United States, and this is not South America where Sanchez could offer a $1 million bribe and be on his merry way. Sanchez then calmly up his ante, offering $2 million to the person who liberates him. Apparently infuriated, the DEA agent has to be restrained by his colleague, and angrily states that the drug lord has a prison cell awaiting him in Quantico. Sanchez is next seen as a prisoner in an armored car transporting him from Florida to Virginia, with Killifer accompanying Sanchez in the passenger seat of the cab. Without warning, Killifer takes his shotgun and buttstrokes the driver. This causes the driver to recoil in pain and lose control of the armored car, which plunges off Seven Mile Bridge into the deep waters of Key West. Sanchez and Killifer then escape in a Shark Hunter II submersible, courtesy of Sanchez's associate, Milton Krest.
Upon arriving at Krest's Ocean Exotica warehouse, Sanchez honors his bargain and pays the DEA agent with a suitcase full of cash. Krest, concerned that Killifer has seen too much, suggests that he be killed; but is rebuked by Sanchez who notes that loyalty is more important to him than money. Entering into the murky world of drug lord justice, Killifer is present at the maiming of his colleague Felix Leiter and watches as he is slowly lowered into a shark tank. Leiter, having recently been widowered due to Sanchez's men failing to kill him in an earlier hit, but managing to kill Della, is aghast that Killifer conspired with Sanchez. Killifer selfishly remarks that $2 million is too good a deal to ignore. Waiting to be picked up at Krest's warehouse, Killifer hears gunshots outside the office and finds that James Bond has disposed of two guards. Holding 007 at gunpoint with a revolver, he opens the same trap door which was used in the dunking of Leiter. Before he can shoot Bond or usher him into the tank, he is knocked off balance by Leiter's fisherman friend Sharkey, who emerges from another trap door directly below him. Bond seizes the opportunity and punches him into the shark tank. As he dangles from a rope over the water, Killifer offers to split the bribe money with Bond if he saves him. The spy refuses, telling him ""You earned it. You keep it, old buddy."" and coldly slings the case of money at him. This causes Ed Killifer to lose his balance, knocking him into the shark tank where he is killed by the same shark who mauled the man he sold out for a fast buck.

981,/wiki/Elektra,"Elektra Vavra King was the daughter of wealthy oil tycoon, Sir Robert King, but also a criminal mastermind associated with terrorist, Renard. One of the two main antagonists in the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough, she was portrayed by French actress, Sophie Marceau, and also appeared in the film's accompanying novelization penned by Raymond Benson as well as its video games.
Elektra is the daughter of Sir Robert King and his second wife. Her maternal background is of Azerbaijani descent; the family had fled the country immediately after the Soviet Union was established and relocated to England. Robert King's marriage had become a much noted affair as he managed to acquire his father-in-law's oil business and assimilate it into his own construction enterprise, forming the official King Industries.
Elektra's subsequent birth was also subject of much press coverage, foreshadowing much of the attention she would receive later on in her early adulthood. As the only daughter of a lucrative oil baron, Elektra had a privileged upbringing, becoming a tad bit spoiled in the process. She attended prestigious private schools around Europe and often spent summer vacationing with her maternal family in the Middle East. After college, Elektra decided to follow in her father's footsteps and join King Enterprises.
Much to the media's delight, Elektra's business affiliation and beauty made her a well known figure in the press. The fame eventually drew the attention of the anarchist Renard, who decided to kidnap her in a scheme to extort a large sum from her father. Sir Robert refused to pay the ransom on the advice of family friend (and James Bond's boss) M. Embittered, she became Renard's lover and participated in his scheme to extort money from her family (going so far as to mutilate her own left ear so Renard could send it to her father as a warning) but pretended to have been traumatized by the kidnapping. (Bond thought she suffered from Stockholm syndrome, but may have been blinded by his affection for her).
Having survived the bombing, Valentin Zukovsky and his men take mount a raid on the tower. Reaching the room where Elektra has Bond, he is shot by her. Dying, Zukovsky uses his cane gun to free Bond, who then chases after the fleeing Elektra, freeing M in the process. During a tense standoff, and at the business end of a gun, Bond demands that Elektra order Renard to call off the imminent meltdown in the city. Elektra then taunts Bond, telling him that he wouldn't shoot her and that he would miss her as she didn't see him as a killer of a former lover in cold blood. She then radios Renard and in her overconfidence on her hold over Bond, she instead tells him to proceed with the plan, and out of anger, Bond immediately kills her with a single gunshot while exclaiming ""I never miss"".
Elektra was a woman who was used to getting what she wants. She did not like to be resisted and will do anything to get her way, including using her charms, torturing and killing anyone who tries to stand in her way. She's also an excellent tactician and actress who passes for an innocent girl when she's really one of the brains behind her operation.

982,/wiki/Dr._Kaufman,"Dr. Kaufman was a fictional professional assassin and German scientist in the employ of media mogul, Elliot Carver. A supporting antagonist portrayed by the late American actor, Vincent Schiavelli, the character first appeared in the 1997 James Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies, was subsequently adapted in Raymond Benson's accompanying novelization as well in 1999 video game adaptation of the film, voiced by Zimbabwean actor Miles Anderson.
A professor of forensic medicine, Kaufman is hired by Media mogul Elliot Carver after he learns about the relationship between James Bond and Carver's wife Paris. After first murdering Paris, Kaufman waits for Bond in his hotel room; intending to kill Bond in such a manner as to make Paris's death appear a murder-suicide. Confronting Bond at gunpoint, he brags about his professionalism and how his services as an assassin are in demand all over the world. Of all the methods at his disposal, apparently his specialty is the celebrity overdose.
Fortunately for Bond, Kaufman's attempt to shoot the MI6 agent is suddenly interrupted by a phone call from his protégé, Richard Stamper. Stamper and his men are attempting to break into Bond's BMW 750iL to retrieve the GPS encoder he had stolen back from them earlier in the film. They are, however, having difficulty bypassing the car's security system. In desperation, Stamper asks Kaufman to make Bond disable the vehicle's security.
Providing Kaufman with his mobile phone - the car's remote control device - 007 tricks him into activating the phone's taser feature, shocking him and giving Bond the opportunity to gain the upper hand. His own weapon now pointing at him, the assassin protests that he is merely a professional doing his job, but Bond simply replies that he is too and pulls the trigger and shoots Kaufman in the head killing him.
The novelisation has Bond reflecting that Kaufman's death is one of the rare occasions where he has killed someone whom he knew unquestionably deserved to die.

983,/wiki/Efua_Ogilvy-Grant,"Aleesha Blessing Belem, alias Efua Blessing Ogilvy-Grant is a Central Intelligence Agency operative sent to Zanzarim early in her career on account of a brewing Civil War in the country. She debuted in the 2013 James Bond Novel Solo by William Boyd.
Blessing was born to at least one Lowele tribe parent in Zanzarim.
At some point she attended Harvard and began working for the CIA.
She was soon assigned to spy on the British Zanzarim Station as the Station Chief's secretary with orders to accompany James Bond to the Democratic Republic of Dahum in order to offer asylum to brigadier Solomon Adeka.
After duping station chief Ed Ogilvy-Grant into thinking he would arrive a week later, Blessing posed as Efua Ogilvy-Grant and briefed Agent James Bond, 007. After a brief conversation, they left for dinner at El Kebab, the only real restaurant in town. Afterwards they headed for a crowded bar to discuss Bond's entry into Dahum. She had arranged to drive most of the way, and had contacted a fisherman to take him the rest of the way by boat. They were then interrupted by a drunk man who mistook Blessing for a prostitute. Bond took him out back and knocked him out: a deed which Blessing felt was unnecessary, but she was grateful for.
The next day, Blessing set to painting the word ""Press"" on a beige Austin 1100 for their journey, and they commenced south, switching drivers every now and then. Unfortunately, they were eventually stopped at a military roadblock, and despite Blessing's best efforts to negotiate a way through, they turned around to not be kept waiting behind the other cars. On the second day they reached the town where they were to part ways, and Blessing met with the fisherman Kojo, who would take Bond into Dahum. That night however, Blessing noticed a Gecko on her ceiling, and having a phobia of lizards, she asked Bond to remove it. He did, and their tender moment turned into a night of lovemaking.
Unfortunately, they were kidnapped by Dahumian soldiers that had mistaken Bond for an English mercenary. Blessing was interrogated in a small tent in the jungle by their leader Jakobus Breed before she and Bond escaped from the rebels when they were attacked by the Zanza Force while trying to cross a road back into Dahum territory. James tried to keep Blessing hidden in the firefight, but Blessing was too afraid and claimed that she would not die in the jungle and ran away.
She managed to hide and survive the fight before wandering the jungle for days and stumbling on a convent where she was nursed to health before setting out for Port Dunbar where she found that Adeka had died. In order to get close to Hulbert Linck, she partnered with a mercenary called Kobus Breed, and on the day Zanza Force reached the city, she had to shoot Bond to prove her loyalty, but did not give a killing blow.
They escaped to Washington DC, where they worked for the charity AfricaKIN until she saw Bond in a restaraunt and alerted the CIA.
Rhe two met up in her hotel room and made love after discussing their mission and Blessing's allegiance. Unfortunately, they were seen by Breed, who would soon break in, slit Blessing's throat, and hang her up in the gotel bathroom with a giant fishhook through her jaw.

While drinking, Bond asks Drax about the Moonraker. Corinne Dufour then returns and Drax tells Bond that she will bring him to Dr. Holly Goodhead, who will show her around. After Bond and Dufour are gone, Drax tells Chang to make sure that some harm comes to Bond.
While showing Bond around, Bond and Goodhead arrive at the centrifuge chamber, in which astronauts are trained to endure the gravity force felt when travelling to space. She invites Bond to have a go and Bond accepts. After strapping Bond into the chamber, Goodhead is visited by Chang, who tells her that Drax wants to speak her. As Goodhead leaves to phone Drax, Chang enters the control room and activates the centrifuge, quickly accelerating it's G-Force to lethal level. When Bond presses the button signaling that he has enough, Chang ignores it. To save himself, Bond uses his wrist cannon to deactivate the control mechanism, causing the machine to stop. The return of Dr. Goodhead stops Chang from acting further and he leaves the control room, which Bond witnesses.
While staying at Drax's estate, Bond is caught investigating the billionaire's study by Dufour. She inadvertently reveals where the safe is located and stands by as Bond photographs the blueprints it contained. Dufour is seen by Chang as she leaves the study, and the following morning, Dufour is summoned by Drax while he is out hunting in the grounds. Informing her that her employment has been terminated, Drax orders Chang to set his trained hunting dogs on her. The dogs chase her into the forest where she is eventually brought down and killed.
Bond follows a clue in the weapon blueprints to Venini Glass, a Venetian glass manufacturer acquired by Drax Industries. Here he discovers Drax's secret biological laboratory where a deadly toxin is being prepared. During his investigation he is confronted by Chang wielding a kendo stick. They continue their fight inside the museum, smashing many of the expensive vases and glasses. Eventually, Bond cuts Chang's stick to pieces with a glass sword he picked up. Realizing that Bond is stronger, Chang flees into the upper parts of the building, hiding there and attacking Bond from behind. He attempts to strangle Bond with a chain, but Bond escapes, eventually reaching the highest part of the building, the clock tower. There, Bond grabs Chang and throws him through the ornate glass of the clock's dial, causing him to fall to his death into a piano on the plaza below.

While examining the item, Bond covertly swaps the priceless original for the fake taken by 009. He follows Khan to India, where he makes it clear to the villain that he has the Egg. Bond permits Khan's associate, Magda, to another fake Fabergé egg (made by the british goverment which Kamal thinks is the real) fitted with listening and tracking devices by Q.

It is also the third James Bond film in the official EON Productions series, and the third to star Sean Connery as the suave and sophisticated British Secret Service agent James Bond.
The novel begins in a similar fashion to Moonraker with an acquaintance of Bond (Junius Du Pont from Casino Royale) meeting him in Miami and requesting that he observe a Canasta game between him and the eponymous villain of the novel, Auric Goldfinger. Du Pont suspects Goldfinger of cheating and offers to pay Bond to confirm his suspicions. It turns out that Goldfinger is indeed cheating and Bond forces him to admit his guilt and pay $50,000, $35,000 to balance out the cheating, $10,000 to buy Bond's silence, and $5,000 for wasting Mr. DuPont's time.
Pussy Galore, the head of a criminal organization from New York City, called the Cement Mixers, as well as various other mobs including the Mafia and the Spangled Mob from Diamonds Are Forever, have been employed to aid Goldfinger in the planning and execution of ""Operation Grand Slam"".

1003,/wiki/Christopher_Lee,"Sir Christopher Lee (May 27, 1922 - June 7, 2015) portrayed Francisco Scaramanga in The Man with the Golden Gun and GoldenEye: Rogue Agent. He was a close personal friend to Sir Roger Moore, whom he first met in 1948.
Christopher Lee was knighted in 2009. Although of aristocratic lineage and excellent education (amongst his classmates future Bond alumni Patrick McNee) he was impoverished by his step father's bankruptcy and forced to take a job as a shipping clerk. He would volunteer to fight the Soviets in Finland in 1939 but not see action in the campaign. His commander, Sir Ormonde Winter, known as 'O', was the former head of intelligence in Dublin Castle and has been suggested as one of the inspirations for 'M'. Lee was in the Home Guard and Royal Air Force during World War II, but despite proving a capable pilot he was forced to drop out of flying training on the verge of his first solo practice mission because of a problem his eyesight. He would be commissioned into RAF intelligence, working  with the SAS, LRDG and SOE in North Africa and interrogating Nazi war criminals in Italy. 
Some of Christopher Lee's most famous roles are: Scaramanga (The Man With The Golden Gun 1974) Count Dooku (Star Wars 2002/2005 voiced his own character in Star Wars: The Clone Wars 2008) Saruman (Lord of the Rings 2001-2003; The Hobbit 2012-2014), Captain Rochefort (The Three Musketeers 1973-4) and Dracula (Dracula 1958). Other roles he has played are the title role in Jinnah, about the first prime minister of Pakistan.
Lee was also a step cousin to Bond creator Ian Fleming, his friend and regular golfing partner. He even starred with pre-007 star Pierce Brosnan in the 1993 espionage film Detonator (A.K.A. Death Train). In 1978, Lee had been offered the role of Dr. Sam Loomis in the classic horror film Halloween, but declined the role because he did not think it worth it to travel all the way to the United States for filming. Fellow Hammer actor Peter Cushing also declined the role for the same reason, and the role of Dr. Loomis eventually went to fellow Bond villain actor Donald Pleasence.
Christopher Lee passed away on June 7, 2015 at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London at the age of 93 while due to the effect of heart failure and respiratory problems. The news of his passing was made public on June 11, 2015 with many reacting.
Roger Moore stated on Twitter on June 11: ""It's terribly [sic] when you lose an old friend, and Christopher Lee was one of my oldest. We first met in 1948 ... Our thoughts are for Lady Lee, Christina and Juan.""

1004,/wiki/Felicca_(Olga_Bisera),"Felicca was the fictional secretary to Egyptian black market trader, Aziz Fekkesh. A minor character portrayed by Italian actress, Olga Bisera, she briefly appeared in the 1977 James Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me, and was subsequently adapted for Christopher Wood's accompanying novelisation.
The gorgeous Felicca works as a low-ranked assistant to Aziz Fekkesh in Cairo, Egypt. She meets James Bond when he visits Fekkesh in Egypt. She has orders to entertain and distract him and she does just that. Bond is naturally suspicious of Felicca, but she soon has him enjoying the moment. She asks if “there is anything she can do for him….anything at all?” Bond replies, “Well, I had lunch, but I seemed to have missed desert”. The woman is apparently attracted to 007 as well and allows herself to get a little bit of pleasure during her work.
At this he takes her in his arms and the two begin kissing sensually. Felicca seems to really enjoy it and probably wants to go further in the bed, but as the two are kissing, she sees an assassin named Sandor in an above window with a gun. Sandor is about to shoot Bond. Felicca panicks and screams to beg the shooter to not kill them. Thanks to that, Bond spins just in time, and Sandor kills Felicca instead, the poor woman being used as a human shield. Bond allows her body to fall to the bed as he goes after Sandor.
This is the last time we see Felicca, and from the shot and the look at her body, it is obvious she did not survive the gun shot. In a few seconds, she met a man that she didn't know before, she kissed him and she lost her life because of him.

1008,/wiki/Blofeld_(Christoph_Waltz),"Ernst Stavro Blofeld, born Franz Oberhauser, was the main antagonist of the the rebooted James Bond series, serving as the unseen overarching antagonist of the first three films Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall, the main antagonist of Spectre and the overarching antagonist of No Time to Die.
He was not surprised when 007 and White's daughter, Madeleine Swann, determined the location of his base of operations. Greeted with a formal reception, Blofeld took them on a tour of his data-collection facility. He attempted to psychologically intimidate the pair, demonstrating his organisation's vast reach, and sadistically taunted Bond with intimate knowledge his past failures. This included showing Swannn footage of Bond and her father, moments before Mr. White had shot himself, which Bond had furiously demanded that Blofeld turn off. Enraged and determined to prevent Swann from seeing her father's death, Bond charged at Blofeld, only to be knocked to the ground by one of Blofeld's henchmen. Concluding, Blofeld had Bond struck unconscious and strapped him to a neurosurgical chair.
Revealing his new identity, the mastermind declared his intention to intimately torture Bond by drilling into his skull, the seat of his soul; depriving him of the ability to recognize faces, and, ultimately, destroying his visual cortex, leaving him completely blind. He was saved by Swann, who hurled the spy's explosive wristwatch at Blofeld's control console, which violently detonated and threws him across the room. In the chaos, Bond escaped and shots a fuel line - causing the entire complex to be consumed in an enormous fireball. Somehow, Blofeld survived the conflagration, but was left severely scarred on the right side of his face and, ironically, blind in his right eye.
Bond returned to London to prevent ""Nine Eyes"", with Blofeld following him to exact his revenge. He separately abducted Swann and Bond, and took them both to the ruins of the old SIS Building, which was scheduled for demolition. 007 freed himself and confronted Blofeld inside. Separated by a pane of bullet-proof glass, the villain revealed that he had hidden Madeleine somewhere inside the building. It was set to explode in 3 minutes: giving Bond the sadistic choice of dying alongside her, or saving himself and living with the pain. 007 liberated Swann and they narrowly escaped the building.
Believing them to be dead, Blofeld departed by helicopter - unaware that they were pursuing him along the River Thames in a boat. One of Bond's gunshots started an engine fire; causing the aircraft to crash land on Westminster Bridge. The wounded Blofeld crawled from the wreckage and was confronted by 007. Held at gunpoint, he told the spy to kill him. But Bond refused, ejecting his magazine, clearing the chamber, and stating that he was out of bullets. As Bond departed with Madeleine, SIS chief, Gareth Mallory, detained the villain on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, under the Special Measures Act of 2001. With Denbigh dead and the ""Nine Eyes"" scheme foiled, Blofeld accepted his fate with resignation.
Now the sole remaining member of the organisation, Blofeld came under the scrutiny of SIS, who confiscated his prosthetic eye and permitted Bond to perform an interrogation. Meanwhile, Safin blackmailed Swann into smuggling Heracles into Belmarsh with the intent of infecting Blofeld with the lethal virus-like weapon. Unwilling to do the deed, she inadvertently infected Bond; who, after being goaded by Blofeld, strangled him in a fit of rage. He was consequently infected with Heracles and perished within seconds.
Blofeld was also intensely sadistic, describing himself to James Bond as ""the author of all [his] pain."" Throughout their confrontations, he would ruthlessly play a number of cruel and elaborate games with James' mind about his past and the people he had lost all his life - Vesper, M, his parents, etc., torturing Bond by drilling holes in his head and penetrating his brain, remaining calm and smiling when James screamed in pain, and condemning Mr. White to a very painful death by thallium poisoning. Blofeld had little self-preservation instinct, despite his vile character.

1011,/wiki/General_Han,"Sangjang Han was a fictional North Korean military officer allied to Gustav Graves. A supporting antagonist portrayed by actor, Daryl Kwan, the character first appeared in the 2002 James Bond film, Die Another Day, and was later seen in its accompanying novelization penned by Raymond Benson.
Along with General Dong and General Li, Han is invited over to Graves' Ice Palace for a demonstration: a new satellite called Icarus that can provide sunlight to areas of the world which lack it in order to promote agricultural development in cold climate countries. However, it turns out that Icarus was actually designed as a weapon to detonate mines placed along the De-Militarized Zone between North and South Korea, as Graves intends to create a path carved through the De-militarized zone so that all of Korea would be reunited by force under North control. To that end, Graves provides a secret demonstration to Dong, Li and Han by using the satellite to trace down and kill James Bond with a giant laser, though Bond manages to escape from being killed.
Following Graves' return to North Korea, Han helpes him and the other generals form a coup against Graves' father General Moon by putting him under house arrest. Han and the generals then watch as Graves shows Moon of his plot. However, Moon is outraged by this and grabs Han's gun in an attempt to shot Graves, only for the latter to stun him and shot him down in anger, something which Han and the other generals didn't expect. Needless to say, Bond and his NSA partner Jinx breaks into the plane just as the former accidentally fires a bullet in one of the plane's windows, causing the cabin to lose pressure. Han, along with Vlad and the generals, are blown out of the plane and fell to their deaths.

1012,/wiki/Bianca_(Tina_Hudson),"Bianca was a fictional intelligence operative employed by the British Secret Service. A minor character and Bond girl, she appeared in EON Productions' 1983 James Bond film Octopussy and was portrayed by Tina Hudson.
James Bond's colleague Bianca aides him when he arrives in Latin America to destroy an enemy spy plane. Meeting him at a horse-training event, Bianca provides Bond with a disguise (complete with a fake moustache) in order to make him look like Colonel Luis Toro. However, 007's cover is blown whilst infiltrating the aircraft's hanger. Minutes later, Bianca spots Toro's paratrooper guards driving away with a captured Bond. She speeds up to the vehicle in her Jeep and flashes her bare thighs to distract the guards. Seizing the opportunity, Bond pulls the rip cords on the guards' parachute harnesses. Before Bond escapes in an Acrostar Bede Jet hidden in the back of the Jeep's horse trailer, he kisses Bianca goodbye and says that he will meet her in Miami.
"
1013,/wiki/Elliot_Carver,"Elliot Carver was a fictional British media baron who attempted to provoke a war between the United Kingdom and China in order to destroy the Chinese government and use the new government to obtain exclusive broadcasting rights in China. The character was the main antagonist in the 1997 James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies and was portrayed by British actor Jonathan Pryce. Carver also appeared in Raymond Benson's accompanying novelization as well in his 1999 video game adaptation, voiced by Steve Hope Wynne.
Elliot Carver was born in Hong Kong, officially an orphan. He is the illegitimate son of a German woman who died in childbirth and Lord Roverman, a press tycoon. A Chinese family took the boy for a one-time fee of fifty pounds. Thirty years later, Carver confronted and blackmailed Roverman into suicide and took over his media empire.
Elliot Carver went to college in Hong Kong and received a degree in the communication arts. By his own accounts, he had worked for a local newspaper during his adolescence. During his early adulthood, he was hired as a meteorologist at a Hong Kong Television Station and eventually became the station's anchorman. During this time, he often sexually harassed his female coworkers, to the point that one of them fled Hong Kong to get away from him.
In the years since, Carver fashioned himself as a media magnate, utilizing his background in the press and broadcasting. After striking success in rebranding Roverman's enterprise as his own, Carver took Paris McKenna as his first wife. Before marrying Elliot, Paris Carver was romantically linked to James Bond.
In the present, Carver is a billionaire international media mogul of the German-based mass media company, the Carver Media Group Network. He frequently uses his influence to gain advantage for his firm or wreak havoc on opponents. Moreover, CMGN is typically the first to report on scandals and disasters due to the fact that it directly orchestrates them. During one of Carver's daily teleconferences, various heads of his divisions smugly gloat over the terror they inflict upon the world: Jeff Hobbs reports ""floods in Pakistan, riots in Paris and a plane crash in California"" while Philip Jones has all current releases of CMG's software loaded with bugs, forcing consumers to endlessly upgrade. To boost his viewership, Carver instructs Tom Wallace to call the President of the United States and threaten to release scandalous photos of him with a cheerleader if he doesn't sign a bill lowering cable rates - and then to release the photos when he complies.
During the CMGN Satellite Network inaugural party, Carver denies claims that after British beef baron Sir Angus Black lost £10,000 in a game of poker to him and refused to pay up, he exacted revenge by releasing stories on Mad Cow Disease. He further retorted that there was even less truth to the rumor that the French paid him 100 million francs to keep the stories going.
Having been denied media presence in China, Carver attempts to provoke a war between them and the United Kingdom, hoping to wipe out the existing Chinese leadership in Beijing. This action would effectively allow the Carver Media Group secure exclusive broadcasting rights in China for the next century. To that end, Carver arranges for a stealth ship to be built, utilizing material smuggled by the Chinese general Chang. In return, Chang would be placed in the top seat within the Chinese government, while Carver would capitalize upon the coverage of the ensuing conflict.
During the initial phase of his plan, Carver sends American ""techno-terrorist"" Henry Gupta to purchase a GPS encoder (made by the American military) from a terrorist arms bazaar. Gupta then utilises the encoder to remotely interfere with the GPS systems of both the British HMS Devonshire and two Chinese MiG's. This sends the Navy frigate and Airforce jets off-course into what is perceived to be Chinese-held waters. Meanwhile, Carver has Richard Stamper and Captain Scott oversee the sinking of the Devonshire at the hands of his torpedo-like ""Sea-Vac"" drill (piloted by Timblin). From the Stealth Boat, Carver's forces unleash the Sea-Vac upon the warship and launch two guided missiles that obliterate the rival aircraft overhead. Carver then has his men eliminate the surviving crew with Chinese military-grade rounds while a diving team steals a cruise missile from the sunken ship.
Meanwhile, MI6 notices a spurious signal from one of the CMGN communications satellites, directed at the coordinates where the frigate was sunk. M sends James Bond to investigate Carver after his publication delivers news with critical details, hours ahead of competing media outlets. Bond travels to Hamburg and infiltrates Carver's launch party for his new satellite network. While posing as a banker, he meets the villain for the first time and also reunites with Paris. Carver develops an instant suspicion of Bond when the spy questions him about the applications of his satellites. He has his henchmen capture and attempt to interrogate Bond, but the spy escapes and cuts off power to Carver's live international broadcast, sabotaging the party and humiliating him.
Later, Carver learns by Gupta that Bond is a secret agent and commands Paris to get information from him as to why he was at the party and what he knows. Carver soon discovers that Paris and Bond are former lovers despite her claims that any former ties to the man were merely platonic. Feeling infuriated and betrayed, Carver has his wife killed by master assassin, Dr. Kaufman.
As Bond further investigates the Devonshire wreck, he discovers that the ship and aircraft had actually been in Vietnamese waters during the Stealth Ship's attack. During this time, Bond also discovers that People's External Security Force agent Wai Lin had also been probing Carver's activity. Previously, the two had encountered one another twice at Carver's Hamburg HQ - first at the launch party and later that subsequent day. The pair of agents are eventually captured by Stamper and taken to Carver at a CMGN tower in Saigon. Meeting with them, Carver reveals his plans to the pair and prepares to have them tortured by Stamper. However, they manage to escape and subsequently agree to collaborate on the investigation.
The two find Carver's stealth ship in Ha Long Bay and board it to prevent the madman from firing the stolen cruise missile at Beijing. During the battle, Wai Lin is captured but Bond manages to evade Carver's henchmen by using one of the guards to fake his death. On the ship's bridge, Bond captures Gupta to use as his own hostage. However, Carver kills Gupta as the final stage of the plan is set to go forth. Despite being cornered, Bond detonates an explosive, damaging the ship and making it visible to the Royal Navy's radar. Carver eventually sneaks up on Bond in the control room and holds him at gunpoint; he explains to Bond that by foolishly destroying the stealth ship, any evidence of Carver's actions is also destroyed. As the mogul pontificates, Bond secretly activates the Sea-Vac. With the roar of the drill having momentarily distracted the enemy, Bond is able to disarm him. He then holds a screaming Carver in front of the approaching drill and releases him at the last possible second, shredding him to pieces as Bond escapes.
Bond ultimately thwarts Carver's plan by positioning detonators on the missile to ensure its destruction before launch. With confirmation of Carver having expired in the Stealth Ship's destruction, M releases a news story stating that Carver went missing while on board his luxury yacht in the South China Sea, while the authorities believed he committed suicide.
Raymond Benson's novelization to the film adds more background to Carver's pre-film biography. The film itself mentioned that he previously worked for a newspaper in Hong Kong, but the novel reveals that he was the illegitimate son of the British newspaper baron Lord Roverman and a German prostitute. His mother died in childbirth, and his father paid a Hong Kong family to take him in. His foster father revealed on his deathbed who Carver's father really was. Carver went on to become a TV anchor in Hong Kong until he went to England to notify his father that he knew who he was, and his father tried to bribe him into never coming back. Carver then met Stamper and had him follow his father, and Stamper discovered that Lord Roverman was having an affair with an American prostitute and that he enjoyed dressing up in a Catholic school-girl's uniform while she spanked him. Carver tortured his father with this information until Lord Roverman re-wrote his will to make Carver his sole heir. Roverman then went back to America to find that Stamper had already murdered his mistress. Stamper then gave Roverman a gun and pressured him to commit suicide which he subsequently did. Roverman's wife and daughter tried to contest his will as they did not even know of Carver's existence, but Carver won in court and inherited his father's fortune.
Carver appears throughout several points in the narrative, ultimately serving as the game's final boss. While his role in the adaptation is largely unchanged from that of his film depiction, the final altercation differs significantly. Unlike in the film, Carver engages Bond in a deadly firefight, utilizing a powerful submachine gun rather than the handgun from the film. Upon losing the showdown, Carver slowly succumbs to his injuries but not before activating the stealth ship's self-destruct countdown. With his dying breath, Carver assures Bond that escape is futile and that his media empire shall live on. As he keels over, the player is able to pick up Carver's weapon as well as the keycard needed to deactivate the missile launch.  
Personality-wise, Carver is manipulative and vengeful, remorselessly murdering anyone he deems useless or a traitor. Carver is also vain and highly narcissistic, going so far as to decorate his headquarters and other places pertaining to his media empire, with tapestries and over sized banners that bear his visage. It also appears that Carver has a rather unique affinity for television screens since all of his bases are saturated with unusually grand quantities of video screens, some large enough to cover several meter-high walls.
Physically speaking, Carver poses no real threat and would much rather rely upon his vast legion of henchmen before getting involved in any altercations himself. Possessing a rather wiry frame coupled with a thinning head of neatly trimmed grey hair, Carver (in traditional Bond Villain fashion) is perpetually seen wearing a series of identical black Nehru suit jackets; the media baron usually wears these vestments over a black mock-neck shirt and matching dress slacks. His most distinguishing feature, perhaps, are his reflective steel rimmed glasses with which he is never seen without.

1016,/wiki/Eidolon,"After an accountant left some traceable elements in a transaction report, Beckett Hawkwood murders his accountant while Sir Stephen Mackmain, the head of MI5 appeals to the undersecretary of state to join his cause in the re-examination of the ""Hard Rule"", a policy put in place to prevent MI6 operatives from carrying firearms inside the country. Elsewhere, James Bond arrives at Los Angeles International Airport in preparation to extract an accountant from the Turkish Embassy. Felix Leiter, on behalf of the CIA, met him there to equip him with a gun and other supplies to keep the extraction quiet. After a two hour drive to the Consulate, Bond finds Cadence Birdwhistle and informs her that her covert position has been compromised. She is dubious until a kill team appear using CIA issue Glock 9s with false Turkish Consulate ID cards. Birdwhistle then informs Bond of her work at the Consulate. As a forensic accountant, she had discovered a series of transactions from MIT in Turkey to Britain using the code name ""Eidolon"". Bond contacts Bill Tanner and is cleared to return to England, but due to a bomb threat, the airport was closed, leaving Bond and Birdwhistle trapped in Los Angeles.
They check into the Shimmer Hotel, an MI6 safe-house in LA, and stay the night until the bomb threat is cleared. At the airport, are attacked by two CIA agents, that Felix insists were not sent by the CIA. Bond having killed them, they fly safely to London, where they are attacked by masked gunmen. Fortunately, James had asked for ""Targe Protocol"", which saw to it they were given a heavily armored car: the Mercedes S 600 Guard. Bond reports the happenings of his journey to M and Bill Tanner, with whom they deduced that the Turkish MIT agents and the CIA agents acting off task simply to get to Birdwhistle for discovering illegal transactions through shell companies, many with the name ""Eidolon"", a synonym for ghost or spectre, meant that SPECTRE had returned and had infiltrated the security organizations. Due to the ""Hard Rule"", no MI6 operative could carry a weapon inside the United Kingdom, which necessitated delivering Birdwhistle to an MI5 operative, which would be risky due to the fear of SPECTRE. At that point, and MI5 officer demanded to see M.
Senior MI5 field officer Eve Sharma, informed M that an assault on an MI6 officer on English soil made the offense an MI5 case, and she demanded to take it over. Bond subtly pointed out to her that the gunmen at the airport had used MI5 weapon kits, and M stayed adamant that they would handle the case. Sharma left, but insisted that they needed her help and that Stephen Mackmain himself was against her going to see them. Elsewhere in the Vauxhall Cross building, Birdwhistle had encountered a snag in her money chain, and Tanner called in an I Branch specialist, who concluded that it was MI5 security codes, that they had cracked long ago. With her new information, Birdwhistle was able to discover that Eidolon funds were being transferred through MI5 to The Strategic Reserve, an MI5 run Box Tunnel records, computers, and a fleet of underground steam engines in case of a nuclear attack on Britain. M had believed the Box Tunnel to be abandoned and sealed, and sent 007 to investigate. M ordered him to go against the Hard Rule and to draw arms from Q Branch as part of a deniable operation. Q gave Bond a Smith and Wesson Model 500, and a Colt .45 as a sidearm. Bond infiltrates the tunnel and discovers boxes of automatic rifles. He then sees Beckett Hawkwood justifying to a henchman why he will not receive an equal cut of the booty, justifying that he and a Mr. Cullen were Eidolon, and he was simply a worker. As he turned away he discovered Bond, and Hawkwood offered a bonus for whoever brought back the corpse. Hawkfield then threw a flare into the room to light it, and began tossing grenades, which took out one of his men, and mortally wounded Cullen.
Bond shoots the last remaining henchman and finds Cullen and takes him back to London, where he and Bill Tanner torture him with boxcutters. Afterward, they report to M that Eidolon is a series of SPECTRE failsafes, comprised of caches of resources paired with four man cells hiding in various Security organizations such as MIT and the CIA, waiting until an armed attack could be mounted. Among the list of confirmed MI5 Eidolon members was Gareth Cullen and Beckett Hawkwood, whom M recognized as a war hero, but those were the only two that Cullen admitted to before requiring a medic. M used the information about Eidolon to defuse the international tensions, and Bond went for a drink. At the bar he was approached by Eve Sharma, who told him she was convinced of a rouge team inside of MI5, that she had been trying to track down for a year, and admitted that she needed MI6's help to get to the bottom of it. Elsewhere, Hawkwood converses with an unknown element of the Eidolon team and they agree to take out their opposition the following day. M then receives a summons, along with Mackmain to discuss the Hard Rule with the Intelligence Services Commissioner. There, M and Birdwhistle presented their case and their findings, with Mackmain providing verbal backlash on each aspect. The security guard in the room then shoots the commissioner in the head, and Miss Moneypenny shoots him, before Mackmain pulls a gun on her, as she points hers at him. M then quips that they have found the remaining two Eidolon members, and Mackmain confirms their suspicions of Eidolon being a stockpile of money and resources for a SPECTRE re-emergence. Hawkwood then walks in to inform them that his team had secured the building.
When Hawkwood berates M for not bringing more security, he enters a flashback in which immediately after Hawkwood's team took out the guards, and Hawkwood entered the building, Sharma, whom Bond had informed of the situation, and who had come along for the operation, took them out, and burst into the room. She fired on Hawkwood, and missed, Mackmain then attempted to assassinate M, but Bond discreetly shot him in his spine. Hawkwood escaped through a window. Bond then shot the downed Mackmain in the head, and he and Sharma went after Hawkwood. Sharma was hit with Hawkwood's car, and Bond had to pursue him alone. James followed the car Hawkwood had stolen, which had an MI6 tracker installed, and pursued him in his Bentley. Unfortunately, Bond crashed his car in the chase, and had to be picked up later by M in an Aston Martin DB5. Elsewhere, Hawkwood was picking up the ""Crown Court"", a volumetric vacuum bomb that he had called his mercenaries to prepare during the chase.
While walking through London, Birdwhistle sees Hawkwood on the phone and quickly informs Bond. Bond was stuck in traffic nearby, but had two operatives that were stationed in the area go after Hawkwood. He killed them both and chased down Birdwhistle, who stabbed him in the neck with an uncapped pen, buying her enough time to escape. Hawkwood filled the wound with super glue, and on seeing tightened security at the parliament building, informed his mercenaries that the plan had changed and killed them when they complained. Seeing this, Bond began to pursue Hawkwood's truck upon seeing the bomb inside. On deducing that he planned to obliterate the MI6 building, Bond rammed the truck's cab into a building and engaged Hawkwood in hand-to-hand combat. Hawkwood bests Bond and tries to run away, but is at a dead end. Bond stabs him, and he reveals that He simply wanted to be paid, as duty and honor and idealism meant nothing to him after his accident. Bond then gave him an ultimatum: he could live to be taken into police custody in a few minutes time and live as a terrorist and criminal, or die and the police would only know what Bond told them, which he said would be a tale of him being a hero. Bond then handed Hawkwood his knife, and before he slit his own throat he told Bond to tell MI5 that they ""should have treated him right"", to which Bond replies ""No"".

1017,/wiki/Armalite_AR-7_survival_rifle,"The Armalite AR-7 Explorer survival rifle was a design by Fairchild Engine and Aircraft Corporation's famous ArmaLite Division. It was an improvement of the earlier AR-5, which had been designed for the USAF's MA-1 survival weapon trials but wasn't adopted.
It was a simple .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle with a barrel, action, and magazine made of aluminum alloy and a combination buttstock / storage case made of polymer. The barrel / action group and magazine fit inside the stock, which was water-resistant and foam-filled to make it buoyant.  It however was (and is) popular with campers, target shooters, and varmint hunters.
In From Russia With Love (1963), Bond is given a fanciful version modified by the Q Department. It has a fine wooden buttstock / case, an infra-red scope and mount, a silencer-equipped barrel, and is rechambered for .25 ACP. It is also supposedly a single-shot-only weapon, although its box magazine is visible. The attache case it was packed in concealed (among other things) two 10-round tubes of spare ammunition. Bond and Kerim Bey use it to assassinate Krilencu in retaliation for his raid on the Gypsy camp. He later uses it to shoot down a SPECTRE helicopter.
The same gun is seen in two later Bond movies. In Goldfinger (1964), it is the sniper rifle Tilly Masterson uses to try to assassinate Auric Goldfinger. In On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), the AR-7 is seen packed in its stock/case in Bond's car, a green 1969 Aston Martin DBS.
"
1018,/wiki/Dupont,"Junius Du Pont is a fictional card partner of Auric Goldfinger in Miami Beach, Florida. A minor character, Du Pont appeared in Ian Fleming's James Bond novels Casino Royale and Goldfinger. He was loosely adapted into the character Simmons for EON Productions' 1964 Goldfinger film.
"
1019,/wiki/For_Your_Eyes_Only_(book),"For Your Eyes Only is a collection of James Bond short stories written by Ian Fleming, first published in 1960. The title story of the collection lent its name to the twelfth James Bond film, which was released in 1981 and was the fifth film to star Roger Moore as the suave and sophisticated British Secret Service agent. The film, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and directed by John Glen, was an EON Productions / United Artists movie and adapted both ""For Your Eyes Only"" and ""Risico"" from this collection, as well as part of the novel Live and Let Die. Other stories from this collection also provided source material for later Bond films.
The title of the collection is derived from a piece of jargon often used in government circles with regards to classified information. An ""Eyes Only"" notification indicates either a) the information contained is for the knowledge of authorized readers only, b) information contained is not to be discussed with anyone, or c) all of the above.
For Your Eyes Only marked a change of pace for Ian Fleming, who previously had written only full-length novels featuring his character, James Bond. In the late 1950s CBS made an offer to Fleming to write 32 episodes over a two-year period for a television show based on the James Bond character. This deal came about after the success of the 1954 television episode adaptation of Casino Royale on the CBS television series Climax!. Fleming agreed to the deal and began to write three outlines for the series; however, CBS later dropped the idea. In 1959 Fleming gathered his outlines and novelized them for a collection he originally titled ""The Rough With The Smooth"". The title was changed for publication to For Your Eyes Only and was additionally published with the subtitle of ""Five Secret Occasions in the Life of James Bond"". In America the subtitle was changed to ""Five Secret Exploits of James Bond"". In later editions, the subtitle was dropped.
The book contains five short stories:
Out of the five short stories included in the book, two were added in addition to the outlines Fleming had previously written for the proposed television series. The first, ""The Hildebrand Rarity"", was first published in Playboy in 1960. The second story, ""Quantum of Solace"", was an experimental piece Fleming had previously written for Cosmopolitan magazine. The short story actually has no secret agent elements.
The remaining three stories were, as previously stated, written as television scripts. The story ""For Your Eyes Only"" was originally written as the third episode in the James Bond TV series, first titled: ""Man's Work"", later ""Rough Justice"" and ""Death Leaves an Echo"" before finally settling on ""For Your Eyes Only."" Along with ""Risico"" (originally spelled ""Risiko""), ""For Your Eyes Only"" was adapted closely for the 1981 film version of the same name. ""Quantum of Solace"" was chosen as the title for the 2008 Bond film, but otherwise the film had no connection to the story beyond some superficial similarity in that the lead female characters in both were in abusive relationships. ""From a View to a Kill"" provided the title (but little else other than the short story and part of the film both being set in France) for the 1985 film A View to a Kill. ""The Hildebrand Rarity"" provided the character of Milton Krest and the sea vessel name Wavekrest for the 1989 Bond film Licence to Kill.
According to Henry Chancellor's James Bond: The Man and His World, ""From A View to a Kill"" was initially intended to be the backstory for Hugo Drax, the villain of Moonraker. The similar story would have taken place during World War II and featured Drax as the motorcycle assassin who crashes his bike and is taken to an American field hospital. Later the hospital is bombed leaving Drax with amnesia and a disfigured face.
The stories within the collection have been republished in other formats. In 2008, the five stories, along with those in Octopussy and The Living Daylights, were compiled in the Penguin Classics release Quantum of Solace: The Complete James Bond Short Stories, released as a tie-in with the film. In 2011, Penguin Modern Classics paired ""From a View to a Kill"" with ""The Living Daylights"" (from Octopussy and The Living Daylights) in a small compilation titled The Living Daylights.
""From a View to a Kill"" sees Bond investigating the murder of a dispatch-rider en route from SHAPE (central command of NATO in Europe located in Versailles) to his base, Station F, in Saint-Germain, France. Since Bond was already in Paris, M sends Bond to assist in the investigation in any way he can. To unravel the mystery Bond disguises himself as a dispatch-rider and follows the same journey as the previous rider to Station F. As expected, the assassin attempts to kill Bond, however, Bond is ready and ends up killing the assassin.
Bond tracks down the site of the base and observes it. He takes note of the location and gives it to agent Mary Ann Russell. He then proceeds, alone, to blow it up in the early evening. He is attacked by several surviving villains and is rescued by Russell and her fellow staffers from Section F.
The title is taken from a version of the words to a traditional hunting song, ""D'ye ken John Peel?"": ""From a find to a check, from a check to a view, from a view to a kill in the morning"". The title, ""From A View to a Kill"", was later used for the 1985 Bond film A View to a Kill, starring Roger Moore. Originally, the film was to be titled the same as the short story, but was changed just prior to release. The title, plus the fact part of the film takes place in France, is where any similarity between short story and the film end.
After a vacation to London during which Rhoda's affair ended, Masters returns and decides to end their marriage, although they would continue to appear as a happy couple in public for the sake of his job. While the story may not be full of adventure as previous Fleming tales, the point of the story was to show that Bond's adventures pale in reality to real-life drama. As the story closes, Bond reflects on the story the Governor told and comes to the conclusion that his current mission is dull and unexciting in comparison. The story is also an eye-opener for Bond who, before hearing the tale, had passed judgment on Rhoda who was one of the guests at the party.
In ""Risico"" James Bond is sent by M to investigate a drug smuggling operation based out of Italy that is pumping narcotics into England. M instructs Bond to get in touch with a CIA informant, Kristatos, who in turn tells Bond that a man named Enrico Colombo is behind the racket. Bond gets close to Columbo’s mistress, Lisl Baum, by posing as a researching author. When Bond sets out to find more information on Colombo from her, he is captured by him and brought aboard Colombo's ship, the Colombina. While in captivity Colombo informs Bond that Kristatos is actually the one in charge of the drug smuggling operation and that he is being backed by the Russians. On the next day, the Colombina arrives at Santa Maria, where men are loading another shipment. Bond, Colombo, and the crew of the Colombina attack the warehouse and discover Kristatos inside. While trying to escape, Kristatos is shot by Bond.
""The Hildebrand Rarity"" also predated the publication of the collection, appearing first in the March 1960 issue of Playboy. In this adventure, Bond is on holiday in the Seychelles Islands with his friend, Fidele Barbey. Through Barbey, Bond meets an uncouth millionaire named Milton Krest who has offered the two the job of aiding him in the search for a rare fish named ""The Hildebrand Rarity"". After agreeing to help, the three as well as Mrs. Elizabeth Krest set off aboard the Wavekrest in search of the fish. During the journey Bond learns that Mr. Krest verbally and physically abuses everyone around him, specifically his wife whom he punishes with the use of a sting ray tail he dubs ""The Corrector"". After finding the Hildrebrand Rarity, the party returns to the Wavekrest and returns to port. Along the way Krest gets drunk and insults Bond and Barbey and also schedules an appointment for his wife with ""The Corrector"".
During the same night Bond hears Mr. Krest choking, after which Bond discovers Krest has been murdered and the rare fish was stuffed into his mouth. So as not to be entangled in an investigation for the murder of Krest, Bond throws him overboard and cleans up the scene of the crime. The following day after the Wavekrest has reached port no one knows what had happened to Mr. Krest and all presume he fell overboard. Bond investigates both Barbey and Mrs. Krest and finally comes to the conclusion that Mrs. Krest had murdered him in an act of revenge for the way in which Milton Krest had treated her, although she never admits to committing the crime and Bond never asks.
Four of the five short stories in For Your Eyes Only were adapted into James Bond comic strips which were published in the British newspaper the Daily Express and subsequently syndicated around the world:
The first three stories were adapted by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky and are largely considered a depature from what readers of the comic strips were used to, focusing more on character details and the plot of the story. More so than any other adaptation, ""Risico"", ""From a View to a Kill"", and ""For Your Eyes Only"" are considered to be the most faithful adaptations of Ian Fleming's original work. All three stories were reprinted in 2004 by Titan Books and are included in the Goldfinger collection.
The fourth adaptation, ""The Hildebrand Rarity"", did not appear until six years after the comic strip versions of the other stories. It was adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak. This adaptation was reprinted by Titan Books in the early 1990s and again in 2004 as part of the Octopussy collection.
The remaining story in the collection, ""Quantum of Solace"", is one of only three Ian Fleming James Bond stories that has never been adapted as a comic strip. The other two are ""The Property of a Lady"" and ""007 in New York.""

1020,/wiki/Diamonds_Are_Forever_(Radio_Play),"Diamonds Are Forever was a radio drama adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1958 novel that first aired on July 25, 2015 on the BBC's main spoken-word channel, Radio 4. It was the last of five new James Bond radio plays produced by the station and starred Toby Stephens as the titular character for the fifth time.
"
1021,/wiki/Gun_barrel_sequence,"The gun barrel sequence is an iconic opening to every official James Bond film beginning with the first, Dr. No in 1962. The sequence is credited to Maurice Binder, a famous title designer who created the opening titles for 14 Bond films. The look of the sequence was achieved with a pin hole camera shooting through a real gun barrel.
In the sequence, a series of white dots scroll across the screen from (the viewer's perspective) left to right. Upon reaching the extreme right of the screen, the dot changes to the view through the barrel of a gun. The gun barrel is seen from the assassin's perspective — looking down at a walking James Bond, who quickly turns and shoots; the scene reddens (signifying the spilling of the gunman's blood), the gun barrel dissolves to a circle, and the film begins.
Simmons hops slightly as he pivots to assume the firing position and, following the blood wash, the dot becomes smaller and jumps to the lower right-hand corner of the frame before simply vanishing.
In Dr. No (1962), the white dot stops mid-screen and the credit line ""Harry Saltzman & Albert R. Broccoli present"" appears across the dot. The text is wiped and the dot continues the sequence. The sequence is accompanied by a soundtrack of electronic noises and then numerous notes that sound like they are being plinked from a wind-up jack in the box; the latter is cut short by the gunshot. The ""James Bond Theme"" then plays very loudly, albeit with the first portion, featuring the theme's faced plucked electric guitar riff, is truncated. The gun barrel sequence in Dr. No segues directly into the credits, a grid matrix of large-scale, bright and rapidly changing coloured circular dots against a black background. This version, without the electronic noises or the Saltzman-Broccoli credit line, was also used in From Russia with Love (1963) and Goldfinger (1964).
Bond wobbles slightly while firing his gun as he adjusts his balance from an unstable position and he bends over to fire. Although the sequence was shot in colour for Thunderball, it is rendered in black and white for  You Only Live Twice (1967).
With a new actor, George Lazenby, in the role of James Bond for On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), a third sequence had to be filmed. As with Thunderball, the sequence was once again shot in colour.
In this rendering, the white dot stops mid-screen and the credit line ""Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli Present"" appears, much as it did in Dr. No. The James Bond theme keeps playing though. As the barrel begins to move and when it stops centre-screen, Bond is walking to position for around a second before turning and shooting as the camera tracks with him, resulting in a ""treadmill"" effect. Lazenby is the only Bond who kneels down to fire; this is also the only version where the descending blood completely erases Bond's image, leaving only the red circle. In this version, the gun barrel is awash with prismatic splashes of light.
When Sean Connery returned to the role of Bond for Diamonds are Forever (1971), the gun barrel sequence filmed for Thunderball was used. As with You Only Live Twice, the sequence was rendered in black and white, but was given a bluish tint. As in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the barrel is awash with prismatic splashes of light, which this time ripple through it. Unlike On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the splashes of light are erased by the descending blood. This was the last time the sequence was rendered in black and white until Casino Royale. This is also the last gun barrel sequence in which Bond wears a hat.
With the introduction of Roger Moore, and the use of a 1.85:1 matted aspect ratio, a fourth sequence was shot. It was used for just two films: Live and Let Die (1973) and The Man with the Golden Gun (1974). Moore wears a business suit and uses both hands to fire his gun, his left hand bracing his gun arm.
This is the first gun barrel sequence in which Bond is not wearing a hat.
The dots that start the gun barrel in The Man with the Golden Gun are blue but in subsequent releases the dots are white.
In The Living Daylights (1987), Timothy Dalton fires with only one hand unlike Moore, and leans towards the right of the screen, crouching slightly. As with the openings for Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker (the latter of which used a near-identical arrangement of the theme), the blood-flow effect begins before Bond's gun fires. This sequence was reused in Licence to Kill (1989) but with a different theme composed by the late Michael Kamen. The blood in the second sequence begins flowing at the moment of Bond's gunshot, rather than before. These were the last to be presented in non-computer-generated format and the last to be designed by Maurice Binder before his death in 1991.
Following Maurice Binder's death in 1991, Daniel Kleinman became the designer of the Bond opening graphics. Beginning with GoldenEye (1995), the barrel was computer-generated (but still resembles the original images of the barrel itself) emphasising light and shade variations in the rifling spiral as the reflected light shifts with the gun's movement. Like Dalton, Brosnan shoots one-handed. Unlike the previous Bonds, he remains bolt upright as he fires, with his gun arm extended straight at the camera. The blood in this sequence is noticeably darker and falls faster than in previous incarnations; in keeping with this new pace, the main melody line of the James Bond Theme is omitted in all of Brosnan's gunbarrel sequences, save for Die Another Day (additionally, in GoldenEye, a one-off radical rearrangement of the theme is used which is not immediately recognizable). This sequence was also reused in Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) and The World Is Not Enough (1999).
For Die Another Day (2002), Lee Tamahori, the film's director, requested that a CG bullet be added into the sequence, which is seen zooming from Bond's gun towards the viewer and disappearing, suggesting that Bond has fired straight into his opponent's weapon.
The gun barrel sequence was revised again for Daniel Craig's first portrayal of Agent 007 in Casino Royale (2006) (not rip off). Unlike previous installments, the gun barrel sequence does not open the film as a standalone segment: it is part of the plot. Having committed the first kill on his way to becoming a Double-O agent, Bond stops to pick up his gun from the floor but his victim, Fisher, who is a henchman of rogue MI6 section chief Dryden, recovers and seizes his own weapon. As Fisher brings his pistol up to shoot Bond in the back, the frame shifts instantly to the gun barrel perspective; Bond spins around to outshoot his opponent. Like Dalton and Brosnan, Craig shoots one-handed.
This sequence differs considerably from previous versions: it is incorporated into the film's narrative; it begins with Bond standing stationary (although he was walking toward the door before turning); it is not filmed against a blank white void and it includes the person whom Bond shoots. In keeping with the black-and-white theme of the pre-title sequence of the film, it is also the first to be presented in monochrome since Diamonds are Forever (1971) and the first in which Bond is wearing neither a business suit nor a dinner suit.
Furthermore, the computer-generated rifling is microgroove rather than the traditional eight rifling grooves, and the blood comes down the screen quickly, not in a wave, but in rivulets. This is also the first gun barrel sequence without some variation of the ""James Bond Theme"" as, instead, it is accompanied by the opening bars of the film's theme song, ""You Know My Name"".
A redesigned and more traditional-looking gun barrel sequence is reinstated for Quantum of Solace (2008). As the result of a late decision – after a final cliffhanger scene was cut by director Marc Forster – it is placed at the end of the film, immediately preceding the closing titles, resulting in some cinema-goers rising to leave as soon as it began.
This version of the sequence was created by design house MK12, which had replaced Daniel Kleinman as main title designer for the film. The white dot moves through the frame noticeably faster than the previous versions and opens much faster as well. The rifling of the barrel is entirely new with grooves set farther apart than the traditional image used until Die Another Day. Notably, the single dot and its trailing images that traditionally precede the gun barrel sequence also appear in flashes during the opening titles, transforming into letters in the credits, such as the 'C' in the name of actress Judi Dench.
The initial shot of the opening title sequence to ""Another Way to Die"" is meant to resemble the gunbarrel sequence.
The sequence appears at the start of 2015 film Spectre utilising a refined version of the the original Maurice Binder design after a 13 year absence, but uses similar blood effects to Craig's two earlier Bond movies. The lighting then adjusts, soon after Bond fired his gun, silhouetting Bond's figure as the blood falls down. Like Dalton and Brosnan, Craig shoots one-handed.
The sequence appears at the beginning of the 2021 film No Time To Die with its gun barrel utilising the glimmer effect (Craig's silhouette is reflected through the gun barrel's shiny interior) for the first time since 1971 similar to Quantum of Solace's gun barrel but with a much simpler design.  In the international releases, the sequence begins just as the monochrome-filtered shortened version of the Universal Pictures logo fades to become the traditional white dot seen in almost all the gun barrel sequences.  The white dot moves left to the offscreen before it reverts to the traditional dot blinking sequence from left to right.  In the US releases however, the Universal logo is omitted.  From the MGM logo it just cuts to the traditional dot blinking sequence.  Craig wears a dinner suit for the first time since Die Another Day, where Brosnan had a dinner suit. This time, Craig swings his left arm towards the camera and also walks at the same pace as the Quantum of Solace sequence.  After turning towards the camera, he shoots the gun from the right of his chest, arching slightly to the right.  For the very first time, the blood effects are omitted and is replaced with a fade to white.  The camera transitions into the opening scene by zooming through the barrel, midway through the barrel, the scene fades inward and reflects through the gun barrel's interior before the gun barrel's interior disappears offscreen. After the film's lengthy prologue, the film's title sequence begins with ""coloured dot"" elements similar to those at the beginning of Dr. No which were, in turn, originally indicative of the gun barrel.

1022,/wiki/A_Hard_Man_to_Kill,"A Hard Man to Kill was the first and only James Bond short story in the Young Bond series, written by Charlie Higson in 2009. Its story is set between the books Hurricane Gold and By Royal Command and involves James Bond travelling back to London aboard the French ocean liner SS Colombie. It was first featured in the paperback reprint of Higson's 2008 novel By Royal Command and was subsequently included in the series companion book, Danger Society: The Young Bond Dossier.
The story begins in the spring of 1934 as a group of men led by Emil Lefebvre murder a Venezuelan customs officer. Some time later James Bond and his aunt Charmian conclude a Caribbean yacht cruise with the compliments of Jack Stone. They sail into Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe and depart for Plymouth aboard the SS Colombie - alongside a captured French war criminal named General Charles Caiboche. Onboard they play a competitive game of bridge against Lefebvre and James makes friends with one of the gendarme officers guarding Caiboche - a young man named René Mathis. James unexpectedly finds Wilder Lawless, a girl he had met a year prior in Scotland. She is now working with her father transporting horses across the Atlantic. They spend the following day with each other and he reluctantly goes with her to see her equine friends in the hold. Whilst there they witness Lefebvre and his men taking weapons from crates they had brought on-board in Venezuela. Investigating further they find the corpse of the customs officer at the bottom of a crate and attempt to sabotage the villains' plans by throwing their ammunition overboard.
The teenagers approach the ship's first officer for assistance, but are betrayed and taken to Lefebvre's suite. It is revealed that they are ex-Legion soldiers posing as a French gymnastics team - their goal is to liberate Caiboche during a performance and escape on-board another vessel. To protect Wilder, James reluctantly goes with Emil to show him where he hid the ammo; during which he stabs the villain through the foot and makes for the gendarme suite for help. He discovers that Caiboche has murdered his captors and, chased by the bulky man, James locks himself in the bathroom. Mathis is hiding inside and the pair attempt to make to warn the ship's captain. James climbs over the edge of the ship and enters the villains' suite via the smoking balcony. He rescues Wilder and, as they clamber up the side, a shootout breaks out between Mathis and the ""gymnastics team"". As the ship's crew intervene Caiboche deprives them of a chance to take him into custody and leaps off the balcony (seemingly to his death). As Bond sails onward toward home a submarine surfaces alongside Caiboche - proving him to be a hard man to kill.

1023,/wiki/Henchmen,"A henchman is an assassin, hired guard or minion of a Bond villain. Each villain has numerous henchmen to do their bidding, but there is usually a privileged member who is a formidable physical threat to Bond. Henchmen range from adept and tough fighters like Red Grant to those with seemingly superhuman physical characteristics like Jaws.

1024,/wiki/Another_Way_to_Die_(song),"Another Way to Die is the theme song of the Bond film Quantum of Solace. The song was written by Jack White and performed by both White and Alicia Keys. Despite the collaboration being highly anticipated because of the artists involved and the fact that it was the first duet for a Bond theme, the song received negative reception, with most fans and critics feeling that it didn't relate to the Bond films.
"
1025,/wiki/Colonel_Toro_(Ken_Norris),"Colonel Luis Toro was a fictional Latin American military officer. An antagonist portrayed by actor Ken Norris, the character appeared in the pre-title sequence of EON Productions' 1983 James Bond film, Octopussy.
In the pre-title sequence of Octopussy, James Bond is dispatched to destroy an enemy spy plane. Travelling under the guise of a horse trainer, Bond disguises himself as Colonel Toro (complete with a fake moustache, uniform and ID card) in order to access the facility. However, the real Toro notices 007 entering the aircraft hangar and blows his cover before he can complete his mission. Minutes later, Bianca spots Toro's paratrooper guards driving away with a captured Bond and helps free him. 007 attempts to escape in an Acrostar Bede Jet hidden in the back of his Land Rover's horse trailer and uses one of his enemies' own heat-seeking ground-to-air missiles to destroy the hangar with Toro inside.
"
1026,/wiki/Hot-Shot,"Hot-Shot was a series of comic strips that ran in The Daily Express newspapers in 1976. It was reprinted along with other James Bond comics in the Nightbird paperback book.
When Fatima Khalid is chained to the top of a tower to be vulture bait, James Bond hovers in to save her with his Heli-pack. Elsewhere, a jet liner is mysteriously downed on the orders of a Mr. Huliraya. At MI6 headquarters, M is notified of this, the fifth airline crash that the Eblis terrorists had taken credit for, and noting that Bond is in the area, voices hopes that he is on to something. After rescuing Khalid and confirming her identity, Bond asks Fatima about her Eblis connections. Fatima however, despite being a Palestinian freedom fighter, was not connected to Eblis, and considered them maniacs whom she was hunting herself. She suspects that Eblis is a front organization designed to lose support for the Palestinians, and she was on her way to meet a contact named Ibn Awad, who claimed to have discovered the head of Eblis when she was captured. She leads Bond to the warehouse where she and Awad had arranged to meet, but they discover Awad's body, allegedly mauled by a tiger. The lights then cut out and they hear the tiger's roar. Bond picks up a chair and advances in the dark before discovering that the tiger had been a recording on a miniature tape deck. They were however, able to take a note from Awad's hand, reading ""Huliraya"". Being unable to decipher its meaning, Bond takes it to Indian Intelligence, and is informed that Huliraya is the wealthiest businessman in all of India. Bond brings his case up with Bill Tanner, who is able to confirm that Awad was one of fifteen victims killed by tigers in the last year, and that Huliraya's ship had been spotted near one of the places that the airliners had crashed.
Bond goes to investigate the ship, and discovers that Huliraya is not on board, and that he had taken his private helicopter away to an undisclosed location. Bond was quickly thrown off the ship, but on reporting his findings to M and Tanner, he proposes that Huliraya is secretly Dr. Julius No. He then receives a phone call from Khalid, revealing that she had discovered a villa called the House of the Tiger, and suspected it was connected to Huliraya. Justa after she hangs up she is taken away by a man with tiger paw gloves. Tanner then informs M that an American Optic Physics expert named Dr. Frank Mulroy had last been located at Huliraya's company before the airline disasters. When James lands in Tangier, he is ambushed and taken captive by some of Fatima's fellow freedom fighters, who accompany him to the House of the Tiger, where he requests to see Mulroy. He is told by the Company Secretary that Mulroy was discharged, and then returns to the car to tell his associates that if Fatima was kidnapped, the orders came from the House of the Tiger. That night, they begin faux road work outside the House of the Tiger so as to mask the rotor noise from Bond's Heli-pack as he dropped onto a balcony inside the House walls.
Bond quickly finds Fatima, but they are cornered by Shirkahn, the House's security tiger. Bond is able to hold it off by lighting a curtain on fire and using the blaze to block the tiger in the room before closing the door. As they leave, they realize that the House of the Tiger is completely deserted, and Fatima informs James that she had heard guards saying that Huliraya was leaving by sea. After working with the other freedom fighters to find an oil tanker named Shirkahn, M assigns Bond the task of hijacking the tanker to make sure that Huliraya really is Doctor No, and to prevent any more airline disasters.
With the help of a military submarine, Bond poses as a stranded castaway and is taken aboard the Shirkahn before being incapacitated and taken to Huliraya. Bond voices his suspicions about Huliraya's identity, and he reveals himself as Doctor No before taking him to see Fatima being lowered into an on-board shark tank. As the ship passes a fishing boat, Bond and Huliraya go to see Mulroy, who is manning the Hotshot cannon, a solar death beam mounted to the ship's deck that is responsible for downing all of the planes. They then reveal to Bond that the target plane, hosting a middle-east ambassador from the United States, is laced with welding powder that will make breaching the hull much easier for the Hotshot. Bond then dives overboard and is taken up by the submarine. He has the Captain halt the Shirkahn on the grounds that he wants to investigate the Hotshot dish on the deck, while they transmit a warning to the jetliner with the ambassador. The pilot turns the plane around, preventing their demise. Bond then flies to the Shirkahn with his Heli-pack and saved Khalid, who had been taken to the top deck, and then fired a machine gun through the thin hull of the oil tanker, causing the ship to explode with the accumulated heat of the fuel tank and the Hotshot gun before it could fire on the submarine. M then congratulates Bond when he and Khalid return to land.

Painted red, the aircraft was of conventional low-wing monoplane configuration with a radial engine driving a four-blade propeller and was equipped with retractable landing gear. It had an open cockpit, the pilot and co-pilot being seated in tandem. While attempting to escape with a stolen guidance chip, 007 and Zoe Nightshade discover the aircraft in the primary hanger of Phoenix International's Austrian airfield (which served Drake's castle). With Nightshade at the controls, the pair make a narrow escape from the facility and set course for the Swiss border.

1030,/wiki/Auric_Goldfinger_(Gert_Fr%C3%B6be),"Auric Goldfinger was a fictional bullion dealer, jeweler, metallurgist and international gold smuggler. The character was the titular main antagonist of EON Productions' 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger. Portrayed by the late German actor Gert Fröbe (voiced by Michael Collins), he was adapted from the literary character who first appeared in Ian Fleming's 1959 novel. Fröbe's Goldfinger has subsequently appeared in numerous video-games, most notably GoldenEye: Rogue Agent (2004) and 007 Legends (2012).
Arguably the most famous James Bond villain in any film, Goldfinger's obsession is gold. Welcoming any enterprise which will increase his considerable stock, Goldfinger engages in international gold smuggling. Smuggling gold out of Britain, Goldfinger moulds the bodywork of his Rolls Royce in eightee- carat gold, weighing approximately two tons. Making six trips a year to the continent, his men dismantle the vehicle at ""Auric Enterprises, A.G"" in Switzerland. They reduce the gold in a special furnace, which in turn are turned into gold ingots.
A considerably wealthy man, Auric Goldfinger owned many properties throughout the world. Apart from being a legitimate bullion dealer, Goldfinger poses as a legitimate international jeweller. As such, he was legally entitled to operate modest metallurgical installations such as ""Auric Enterprises, A.G"", which he utilzsed in his gold smuggling scheme. An avid golfer who plays with a Slazenger 1 golf ball, Goldfinger owns the golf club where he and 007 play a high-stakes game. He is defeated by Bond, however, when he is tricked by Bond after attempting to cheat. Goldfinger also owned a farm in Kentucky that was used for horse breeding called ""Auric Stud"".
At first, Bond thinks that Goldfinger was planning to steal the gold, but after having a drink with Goldfinger (who said that he had no intention in stealing the gold), Bond soon learns that Goldfinger actually intends to destroy Fort Knox with an atomic bomb made from China (on behalf of Mr. Ling, Goldfinger's nuclear specialist from China), which would render the gold useless and validate Goldfinger's value of gold, thus making him the richest man in the world. To ensure that his plan would be successful, Goldfinger plans to have his fellow band of female pilots to spray nerve gas around the vicinity that would kill thousands of citizens, which will allow him and his forces to enter Fort Knox without resistance. He also decides to bring Bond along (as he plans to have him handcuffed to the bomb to finalize his plan).
However, before the plot went into effect, Bond convinced Goldfinger's personal pilot Pussy Galore to help him thwart Goldfinger's plans. To that end, she secretly called Washington and switched the nerve gas to a more harmless one that would send citizens into a temporary sleep. At Fort Knox, Goldfinger has Bond strapped to the bomb and bids him farewell before learning out in horror that several U.S. soldiers have arrived to the scene. Posing as a U.S. army officer, Goldfinger betrays Mr. Ling by shooting him and Oddjob and Kisch by trapping them inside the vault with the bomb. Goldinger manages to escape after shooting down several U.S. soldiers while Oddjob stays behind to ensure that Goldfinger's plan must succeed, even at the cost of his life and killing Kisch to ensure that no one disarms the bomb.
Though Bond manages to finish off Oddjob by electrocuting him, he has trouble trying to disarm the bomb. After the U.S. soldiers manage to finish the rest of Goldfinger's men, they get in their bomb expert to successfully disarm the bomb for good, thus foiling Goldfinger's plot. After the battle is won, Bond is sent to Washington in a private jet to meet the president, only to find out that Goldfinger has boarded the plane earlier, left the tied-up pilots in the hangar and had Miss Galore pilot the jet. Goldfinger plans to finish off both Bond and Galore for ruining his plans, but during a moment of carelessness, Goldfinger is attacked by Bond and the two fight in the airplane. During the fight, Goldfinger accidentally shoots a window of the cabin and is sucked out of the plane before falling to his death.
Goldfinger appears as a playable multiplayer character in Nightfire and GoldenEye 007.
In a continuity separate from any established canon, Auric Goldfinger was a criminal in an unnamed organization run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld. At some point the Secret Intelligence Service became aware of him, and began to use him in their training scenarios as the mastermind behind a scheme to destroy the global economy by irradiating the gold at Fort Knox. At some point, he extended an offer to join his services to an unnamed SIS agent. After a failed attempt at revenge on Goldfinger's coincidental rival Dr. Julius No, Goldfinger enlisted the agent, now christened GoldenEye, to secure the OMEN (Organic Mass Energy Neutralizer) device that Goldfinger's scientists had created at The Octopus, where he was met by No's forces, attempting to steal the device. Goldfinger planned to use The OMEN against Dr. No. He was eventually killed when GoldenEye and Scaramanga discovered his betrayal and used the OMEN against him.
The character also appeared in the 2012 video game 007 Legends, with the likeness of Gert Fröbe and voiced by Timothy Watson (who also provides the voice of Daniel Craig's Bond).
Despite his jovial, polite and smiling appearance, Auric Goldfinger is in reality an extremely cruel, sadistic, ruthless, threatening, dangerous and anti-competitive businessman and criminal, ready to use any means necessary to achieve his ends, even to the point of manipulating world powers such as Communist China and the American gangster group. He is also remarkably cautious and calculating, carefully planning every detail of his plans and developing alternatives in case of problems, never leaving anything to chance, as the complexity of Operation Grand Slam shows. Moreover, when his plans are foiled by a recalcitrant enemy, Goldfinger is determined to pursue him relentlessly to make him pay for his actions, as he tried again to kill Bond after his plan failed. Intolerant of failure and insubordination, he has a habit of executing his own collaborators when they betray him or when they are no longer useful to him (as was the case with Jill Masterson and the aforementioned gangsters) and is willing to sacrifice even his most loyal henchmen, such as Oddjob and Kisch, if it will further his plans, having left them locked in the Fort Knox vault with Bond and the bomb in order to facilitate his escape. Goldfinger finally has a compulsive need to win at all costs and is therefore merciless to anyone, including Bond, who has the audacity to stand in his way.
His first name, Auric, is an adjective meaning of gold. Ian Fleming chose the name to commemorate the architect Erno Goldfinger who had built his home in Hampstead next door to Fleming; Fleming disliked Goldfinger's style of architecture and destruction of Victorian terraces and decided to name a memorable villain after him. The architect was not pleased to find the character sharing his name and contacted his lawyers; he eventually settled for, among other things, the promise that the character's first name Auric would always be used.

1031,/wiki/Aaron_Abernathy,"Aaron ""Ron"" Abernathy was a fictional Loyalist drug dealer and associate of Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) leader, Sammy Wells. The character served as an ally in Dynamite Entertainment's 2018 spin-off comic James Bond: M.
Aaron Abernathy was a Loyalist drug dealer and associate of paramilitary leader, Sammy Wells. He was also an informant to M, the head of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6). In the mid-late 2010s, Wells attempted to blackmail his former British Army subordinate, M, into procuring the details of former IRA members. After a heated argument in the seedy Loyalist bar, The Mad Dog, M arranged a clandestine meeting with Abernathy at their old rendezvous point, the Crown Liquor Saloon on Great Victoria Street in Belfast. Abernathy informed him of Wells' intention to sell the IRA information to the highest bidder. At some point after the meeting Abernathy was murdered - presumably by Wells. His death was reported in the News Letter.

1032,/wiki/Blofeld_(Telly_Savalas),"Initially a partially unseen character portrayed by Anthony Dawson and Eric Pohlmann (Voice), Blofeld was subsequently played on screen by Donald Pleasence, Telly Savalas and Charles Gray. A final depiction of the character (unnamed for copyright reasons) appeared in the pre-title sequence of For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by John Hollis and voiced by Robert Rietty. Following years of litigation over the ownership of the character, Blofeld was later re-invented for the Daniel Craig continuity of James Bond films (2006-2021), portrayed by Christoph Waltz.
Arriving at an isolated part of the base, Blofeld activates the base's self destruct system before fleeing. Although Blofeld escaped, Bond managed to destroy the rocket remotely before it could capture more astronauts.
Now the subject of an international man-hunt by the British Secret Service titled Operation Bedlam, Blofeld establishes a clinical allergy-research institute atop Piz Gloria in the Swiss Alps. James Bond investigates the office of Swiss lawyer Gumbold, and learns that Blofeld is corresponding with London College of Arms' genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, attempting to claim the aristocratic title ""Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp"". He ventures to Switzerland posing as Bray to gather intelligence on Blofeld, who has went to the lengths of having his earlobes surgically removed to back-up his claims of nobility. There he learns that Blofeld secretly plans to contaminate and ultimately sterilize the world's food supply using biological warfare, carried by his brainwashed Angels of Death. Blofeld claimed he would not carry out his plan if all his past crimes were pardoned and he is recognised as the current Count de Bleauchamp. Bond tries to trick Blofeld into leaving Switzerland so that MI6 can arrest him without violating Swiss sovereignty. Blofeld refuses and Bond is eventually caught by henchwoman Irma Bunt. Blofeld reveals that he identified Bond after his attempt to lure him out of Switzerland, and tells his men to take the agent away. Bond eventually makes his escape by skiing down Piz Gloria while Blofeld and his men give chase.
Aided by his future wife, Tracy, the next morning their flight resumes. However, they are intercepted by Blofeld, who sets off an avalanche; resulting in Tracy's capture, while Bond is buried but manages to escape. M tells 007 that Blofeld's ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. Bond then enlists Marc-Ange Draco and his Unione Corse forces to attack Piz Gloria, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a bobsleigh, with Bond pursuing him. The chase ends when Blofeld becomes snared in a tree branch, ripping him out of the bobsled and apparently killing him. Subsequently, Bond and Tracy marry in Portugal and pull over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car. As they converse, Blofeld (wearing a neck brace) and Bunt commit a drive-by shooting of the couple's car - with Blofeld driving, and Bunt firing the gun. Bond survives, but Tracy is killed in the attack.
Following the pipeline trail, 007 breaks into Willard Whyte's penthouse apartment only to be unexpectedly confronted with two identical Blofelds (who uses an electronic device to sound like Whyte). Bond kills one of the Blofelds, but he turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, where he is picked up by Blofeld's assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd and taken out to Las Vegas Valley where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. Bond escapes and calls Blofeld posing as his right-hand man, Bert Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and rescues him, but in the meantime Blofeld retreats to his oil platform off the coast of Baja California. In the process of escaping he abducts Bond's smuggler ally, Tiffany Case. With the satellite now in orbit, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, then proposes an international auction. Bond travels to the oil platform and is captured in an attempt to sabotage the weapon. Shortly afterwards Felix Leiter and the CIA begin a helicopter attack on the rig. In the ensuing chaos Blofeld attempts to escape using a midget submarine, but Bond gains control of the submarine's launch crane and crashes the sub into the control room, causing both the satellite control and the base to be destroyed.
Blofeld evidently survived the attack and resurfaced years later (dialogue in Marvel's comic adaptation would suggest 10 years after their last encounter) with a plan to exact revenge on his old adversary, James Bond, for foiling his plans and causing the downfall of his criminal organisation. Now wheelchair-bound, bald and wearing a neck-brace, Blofeld rigs a ""Universal Exports""-emblazoned Bell 206 helicopter with remote control hardware and remotely electrocutes the pilot after he collects 007. Taking control of the aircraft over a London gasworks, Blofeld toys with Bond before attempting to crash the flying death-trap in a warehouse. However, 007 regains control of the aircraft and impales Blofeld's wheelchair on its landing gear, lifting the villain into the skies. After toying with his nemesis, Bond drops the pleading Blofeld down a tall industrial chimney stack, killing him from the impact, avenging Tracy's death.
Ernst Stavro Blofeld's personality, in its authoritarian and inhuman megalomania, fits perfectly in the line of such infamous historical names as Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler or Stalin. Despite his absolutely ruthless character, he possessed an exceptionally calm and calculating mind, always acting in a thoughtful manner and leaving nothing to chance.
Although Blofeld was more of a strategist and a master thinker in the background, he was not afraid to personally intervene in the battle if necessary. However, he was most courageous when surrounded by a sufficiently large armed bodyguard, otherwise he cultivated a rather defensive fighting style, whose main goal was his safe escape. He also was a self-concerned megalomaniac who only cared about results, profit, power, and world domination, no matter how many henchmen he needs to sacrifice or innocent lives need to be lost in the process.
Even with several other Bond villains with massive attempted body counts, Blofeld’s plots were easily among the worst and most destructive in the franchise, having threatened millions of innocent lives and planned widespread, irreparable destruction, all stemming from megalomania and other purely selfish reasons without the faintest notion of good intentions.
Although not present in the novel, Blofeld makes his first on-screen appearance in From Russia with Love, portrayed by Anthony Dawson and voiced by Eric Pohlmann. Both men remained uncredited, the end credits listed a question mark instead of an actor’s name. In this appearance his face is not seen and only his lower body is visible as he strokes his trademark white cat, discussing a plan to avenge the death of their member Doctor Julius No by setting a trap that will put Bond and Russian agent Tatiana Romanova in a position where it will appear that they killed each other while escaping to escalate tensions in the Cold War. After being absent from Goldfinger, Blofeld returned in Thunderball.
Right before Blofeld is killed, he begs to Bond to spare him, and cryptically bribes him with a delicatessen in stainless steel. This line had been added in by the producer of the film, Albert R. Broccoli, as a throwback to Mafia slang for a very cushy bribe used during the time and place he was growing up in (as at the time, having a delicatessen in stainless steel was considered luxurious especially if the owner was a street vendor).
The classic depiction of Blofeld has appeared in a number of James Bond video games as a playable multiplayer character. His first appearance was in the 2004 first-person shooter video game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, developed by EA LA and published by Electronic Arts. During its development official footage of character renders released by the publisher featured the terrorist leader 'Number One' holding his Persian Cat, with the likeness of Donald Pleasence. Likely due to legalities, in the final product the character's face is obscured, shot from behind and from the neck downwards. Number 1 was voiced by actor Gideon Emery using a similar intonation to Pleasence's portrayal of the character.

1033,/wiki/Aristotle_Kristatos,"Aristotle ""Aris"" Kristatos (In Greek: Αριστοτέλης Κριστάτος) was a fictional Greek heroin smuggler, intelligence operative and rival of Milos Columbo. He was hired by KGB to obtain the ATAC device. Based on Kristatos from Ian Fleming's short story ""Risico"", he was the hidden main antagonist in EON Productions' 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by British actor Julian Glover and also appeared in the comic adaptation by Marvel Comics.
Aris Kristatos comes from the island of Kefalonia. Generally regarded as a hero for his bravery in World War II and the Greek Civil War, which the British government awarded him the King's Medal, Kristatos was actually a double agent during both conflicts. Though he appeared to be a respectable businessman in the years thereafter, he was in fact a heroin smuggler and a Soviet agent. At one point he worked with another smuggler, Milos Columbo, whom the latter remarked ""then, we were like brothers"". However, as time passed the two smugglers came to argue about what was to be smuggled. Columbo had smuggled commodites such as oil and almonds as they were in high demand and he believed ordinary people were hurt by the crushing tariffs of EU nations, and was later appalled when he discovered Kristatos was involved in heroin and white slavery. He is in union with rogue Nazi supporters who have aided him in smuggling gold, drugs and other supplies out of Britain. In the film, he is hired by General Anatol Alexis Gogol to obtain the British device ATAC (Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator); a device which controls and co-ordinates Britain's nuclear submarine fleet.
While operating in the Ionian Sea, the British spy ship St. Georges is sunk by an old mine hauled up in its fishing nets. The ship was equipped with ATAC. As the waters were too shallow to cover the wreck, the British government ruled out an official salvaging operation. Marine archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock, is hired by the British Secret Service to locate the wreck of the St. Georges. In a bid to steal the ATAC and deliver it to the Soviets, Kristatos has Havelock murdered by Cuban hitman Hector Gonzales; attracting the attention of James Bond and Havelock's vengeful daughter Melina.
Sent to Cortina on his search for his henchman Emile Locque, Bond meets with Italian MI6 agent Luigi Ferrara. The man tells him that he set up a meeting with Kristatos, who could possibly help them.
Bond meets Kristatos at the olympic ice rink, as well as his niece Bibi Dahl, a young iceskating champion who is tipped to be a future Olympic gold medalist. Kristatos introduces them to Bibi and her trainer Jacoba Brink. Bibi then asks Kristatos whether Bond can accompany her skiing later, and Kristatos persuades Bond, telling him that he would feel better knowing that someone was with her. After Bibi has left, Bond hands Kristatos a picture of Locque and asks whether Kristatos knows the man. Kristatos identifies him as Locque and tells Bond and Ferrara that he is the right-hand man of Milos Columbo. Kristatos tells the both agents about his and Columbo's past, stating that they were once close as brothers. He also tells them that Columbo's alias is The Dove. When Bond and Ferrara take their leave, he fails to shake Ferrara's hand, deeming the man too unimportant.
While Bond is skiing with Bibi, he is watched by Locque and Kristatos' other henchman Erich Kriegler, who are waiting for an opportunity to kill Bond. Though Bond eventually separates from Bibi, his men are unable to kill the agent. Kristatos eventually has Ferrara killed by Locque, and, by leaving a dove pin on the body, makes it seem like it was Columbo's work.
Bond meets Kristatos again at a casino in Greece. There, he tells Bond that he has been thinking about why Bond wanted to know about Locque. Knowing that Locque works for Columbo, who is a heroin smuggler, Kristatos tells Bond that he has deduced that Bond is from the British Narcotics Board and Bond leaves him in this fallacy. Sensing the opportunity to get rid off his opponent, Kristatos tells Bond that he might have to kill Columbo to stop him. Pointing at a different table, he shows Bond Columbo, who is been sitting there with his mistress Lisl von Schlaf. Unbeknownst to both of them, their coversation is by Columbo.
When Columbo seemingly insults his mistress, causing her to make a scene and leave the club, Bond tells Kristatos that this might be an opportunity to get information. Kristatos responds that it might be a trap, secretly worried that Columbo might have staged it to make contact with Bond. When Bond insists to follow Lisl, Kristatos tells him to take his car. However, once Bond is gone he calls Locque and tells him to kill both.
While being attacked by Locque and his henchman Claus, Bond is saved by Columbo's men, who kill everyone except Locque, who escapes. Columbo's henchmen then bring Bond to Columbo, who reveals that Kristatos lied to him. All Kristatos said about Columbo was actually about himself - Locque works for him, he is working for the Russians and he is the one to smuggle heroin. To prove that he tells the truth, Columbo proposes that they break into Kristatos' warehouse at Albania at night, the warehouse where he is storing his heroin. There, Columbo is proven right. During the ambush, the warehouse is blown up and Locque is killed by Bond.
When Bond, who with Melina's help has found the wreckage of the ship containing the ATAC, dives down there to get the ATAC, a silent alarm is triggered that tells Kristatos that there are intruders down at the ship. He sends a henchman in a special diving suit, which can be used even in high pressure, who attacks Bond while Bond defuses the mechanism that would lead to the ATAC's destruction. However, Bond is able to defeat him and blows him up with the explosive that was previously rigged to the ATAC. When Bond and Melina get back to the surface, they find that Kristatos and his henchman have taken over their ship. Kristatos thanks them for disarming the device. When Bond tells him that the MI6 will double whatever the Russians are paying him, Kristatos tells him that he never goes back on a deal, as this would hurt his reputation. Kriegler then tells Kristatos that he will deliver the ATAC to the KGB and return with the money, but Kristatos states that their deal was that he would turn the ATAC over at a location of his chosing. He tells Kriegler that he will deliver it to the KGB at St. Cyrils, a clifftop monastery. To get rid of Bond and Melina, he ties them together and binds them to the rear of his yacht, dragging them behind through the water, planning for them to get eaten by the sharks or impaled on the corals. However, Bond and Melina dive down and bind tie the rope around a rock, eventually severing it. Realizing that Bond got free, Kristatos tells the captain to turn the ship around to run them down. To evade death, Melina and Bond dive down to a site where Melina dived earlier and use the air canister she left there to stay underwater long enough to make Kristatos believe that they died.
To find out where this St. Cyrils, of which Kristatos spoke earlier, is located, Bond meets with Columbo, which is a remote monastery on a high clifftop at Greece. Awaiting the arrival of General Gogol, Kristatos is furious when he realises that his niece, Bibi, seems to have grown to despise him. Thinking that Jacoba Brink turned her against him, he tells Brink that he will deal with her as he deals with everyone who betrays him, before storming out of the room. Planning a bigger future, Bibi and Brink plan their escape, but Kristatos finds out. While she tries to get out, Brink stumbles upon Bond, Columbo and his men, who have arrived at the monastery to get the ATAC back. Ultimatly betraying Kristatos for Bibi, she leads the intruders to the guard chambers, where they overpower Kristatos' men, and tells them where Kristatos is.
Meanwhile, Bibi demands from Kristatos to know where Brink is, believing that Kristatos has harmed or killed her. Fed up with the behaviour of his niece, he hits her. Hearing the arriving helicopter of General Gogol prevents him from harming her further. However, before the helicopter lands, Bond, who has been in a fistfight with one of Kristatos' men, falls through the window into the main room, causing Kristatos to realise that he did survive. While Bond engages in a fight with Kriegler, Kristatos takes the attack and flees outside, to hand it over to Gogol. Kristatos rushes towards the helicopter, but is attacked by Columbo. While on the ground, Kristatos drops the ATAC and tries to reach it, but Bond picks it up before him. Melina then arrives, aiming her crossbow at him but Bond talks her out of killing the defenseless man. While Bond talks to her, Kristatos draws a knife planning to kill Bond but Columbo lunges his own knife into Kristatos' back, killing him.
To be added
Despite his status as a seemingly heroic war hero and a distinguished, refined and cultured billionaire, Aris Kristatos is in fact an unscrupulous businessman who uses his respectable facade to play off his various enemies against each other in order to ensure that his superiors in the KGB and the Soviet Union have a smooth operation. A resourceful man, his cover allows him to be well received all over the Mediterranean Sea, making his true nature as a devious and manipulative agent even harder to imagine. Kristatos is also elegant and generally has a calm and thoughtful demeanour. However, despite his amoral methods and the nefarious nature of his activities, he seems to be genuinely attached to Bibi even though the girl sometimes feels oppressed by his tutelage and can sometimes rebel against her godfather, as was the case in St. Cyril, and Kristatos vows in return not to let his feet be trodden on. But he is still a ruthless double agent who cares above all about his reputation and the rewards he earns by serving the Soviet Union behind Britain's back.

1037,/wiki/Chang_(Toshir%C3%B4_Suga),"Chang is a fictional henchman and enforcer employed by wealthy industrialist, Hugo Drax. A major antagonist portrayed by French aikido instructor, Toshirô Suga, the character appeared in the 1979 James Bond film, Moonraker.
After the disappearance of a Moonraker spaceshuttle, James Bond is sent to California to investigate its owner Hugo Drax. While talking, they are then interrupted by Chang, who delivers tea. While drinking, Bond asks Drax about the Moonraker. Corinne Dufour then returns and Drax tells Bond that she will bring him to Dr. Holly Goodhead, who will show her around. After Bond and Dufour are gone, Drax tells Chang to make sure that some harm comes to Bond.
While showing Bond around, Bond and Goodhead arrive at the centrifuge chamber, in which astronauts are trained to endure the gravity force felt when travelling to space. She invites Bond to have a go and Bond accepts. After strapping Bond into the chamber, Goodhead is visited by Chang, who tells her that Drax wants to speak her. As Goodhead leaves to phone Drax, Chang enters the control room and activates the centrifuge, quickly accelerating it's G-Force to lethal level. When Bond presses the button signaling that he has enough, Chang ignores it. To save himself, Bond uses his wrist cannon to deactivate the control mechanism, causing the machine to stop. The return of Dr. Goodhead stops Chang from acting further and he leaves the control room, which Bond witnesses.
While staying at Drax's estate, Bond is caught investigating the billionaire's study by Dufour. She inadvertently reveals where the safe is located and stands by as Bond photographs the blueprints it contained. Dufour is seen by Chang as she leaves the study, and the following morning, Dufour is summoned by Drax while he is out hunting in the grounds. Informing her that her employment has been terminated, Drax orders Chang to set his trained hunting dogs on her. The dogs chase her into the forest where she is eventually brought down and killed.
Bond follows a clue in the weapon blueprints to Venini Glass, a Venetian glass manufacturer acquired by Drax Industries. Here he discovers Drax's secret biological laboratory where a deadly toxin is being prepared. During his investigation he is confronted by Chang wielding a kendo stick. They continue their fight inside the museum, smashing many of the expensive vases and glasses. Eventually, Bond cuts Chang's stick to pieces with a glass sword he picked up. Realizing that Bond is stronger, Chang flees into the upper parts of the building, hiding there and attacking Bond from behind. He attempts to strangle Bond with a chain, but Bond escapes, eventually reaching the highest part of the building, the clock tower. There, Bond grabs Chang and throws him through the ornate glass of the clock's dial, causing him to fall to his death into a piano on the plaza below. Looking down at the corpse, Bond delivers the line ""Play it again, Sam."" as the crowd is confused with the situation.

1038,/wiki/From_a_View_To_A_Kill,"For Your Eyes Only is a collection of James Bond short stories written by Ian Fleming, first published in 1960. The title story of the collection lent its name to the twelfth James Bond film, which was released in 1981 and was the fifth film to star Roger Moore as the suave and sophisticated British Secret Service agent. The film, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and directed by John Glen, was an EON Productions / United Artists movie and adapted both ""For Your Eyes Only"" and ""Risico"" from this collection, as well as part of the novel Live and Let Die. Other stories from this collection also provided source material for later Bond films.
The title of the collection is derived from a piece of jargon often used in government circles with regards to classified information. An ""Eyes Only"" notification indicates either a) the information contained is for the knowledge of authorized readers only, b) information contained is not to be discussed with anyone, or c) all of the above.
For Your Eyes Only marked a change of pace for Ian Fleming, who previously had written only full-length novels featuring his character, James Bond. In the late 1950s CBS made an offer to Fleming to write 32 episodes over a two-year period for a television show based on the James Bond character. This deal came about after the success of the 1954 television episode adaptation of Casino Royale on the CBS television series Climax!. Fleming agreed to the deal and began to write three outlines for the series; however, CBS later dropped the idea. In 1959 Fleming gathered his outlines and novelized them for a collection he originally titled ""The Rough With The Smooth"". The title was changed for publication to For Your Eyes Only and was additionally published with the subtitle of ""Five Secret Occasions in the Life of James Bond"". In America the subtitle was changed to ""Five Secret Exploits of James Bond"". In later editions, the subtitle was dropped.
The book contains five short stories:
Out of the five short stories included in the book, two were added in addition to the outlines Fleming had previously written for the proposed television series. The first, ""The Hildebrand Rarity"", was first published in Playboy in 1960. The second story, ""Quantum of Solace"", was an experimental piece Fleming had previously written for Cosmopolitan magazine. The short story actually has no secret agent elements.
The remaining three stories were, as previously stated, written as television scripts. The story ""For Your Eyes Only"" was originally written as the third episode in the James Bond TV series, first titled: ""Man's Work"", later ""Rough Justice"" and ""Death Leaves an Echo"" before finally settling on ""For Your Eyes Only."" Along with ""Risico"" (originally spelled ""Risiko""), ""For Your Eyes Only"" was adapted closely for the 1981 film version of the same name. ""Quantum of Solace"" was chosen as the title for the 2008 Bond film, but otherwise the film had no connection to the story beyond some superficial similarity in that the lead female characters in both were in abusive relationships. ""From a View to a Kill"" provided the title (but little else other than the short story and part of the film both being set in France) for the 1985 film A View to a Kill. ""The Hildebrand Rarity"" provided the character of Milton Krest and the sea vessel name Wavekrest for the 1989 Bond film Licence to Kill.
According to Henry Chancellor's James Bond: The Man and His World, ""From A View to a Kill"" was initially intended to be the backstory for Hugo Drax, the villain of Moonraker. The similar story would have taken place during World War II and featured Drax as the motorcycle assassin who crashes his bike and is taken to an American field hospital. Later the hospital is bombed leaving Drax with amnesia and a disfigured face.
The stories within the collection have been republished in other formats. In 2008, the five stories, along with those in Octopussy and The Living Daylights, were compiled in the Penguin Classics release Quantum of Solace: The Complete James Bond Short Stories, released as a tie-in with the film. In 2011, Penguin Modern Classics paired ""From a View to a Kill"" with ""The Living Daylights"" (from Octopussy and The Living Daylights) in a small compilation titled The Living Daylights.
""From a View to a Kill"" sees Bond investigating the murder of a dispatch-rider en route from SHAPE (central command of NATO in Europe located in Versailles) to his base, Station F, in Saint-Germain, France. Since Bond was already in Paris, M sends Bond to assist in the investigation in any way he can. To unravel the mystery Bond disguises himself as a dispatch-rider and follows the same journey as the previous rider to Station F. As expected, the assassin attempts to kill Bond, however, Bond is ready and ends up killing the assassin.
Bond tracks down the site of the base and observes it. He takes note of the location and gives it to agent Mary Ann Russell. He then proceeds, alone, to blow it up in the early evening. He is attacked by several surviving villains and is rescued by Russell and her fellow staffers from Section F.
The title is taken from a version of the words to a traditional hunting song, ""D'ye ken John Peel?"": ""From a find to a check, from a check to a view, from a view to a kill in the morning"". The title, ""From A View to a Kill"", was later used for the 1985 Bond film A View to a Kill, starring Roger Moore. Originally, the film was to be titled the same as the short story, but was changed just prior to release. The title, plus the fact part of the film takes place in France, is where any similarity between short story and the film end.
After a vacation to London during which Rhoda's affair ended, Masters returns and decides to end their marriage, although they would continue to appear as a happy couple in public for the sake of his job. While the story may not be full of adventure as previous Fleming tales, the point of the story was to show that Bond's adventures pale in reality to real-life drama. As the story closes, Bond reflects on the story the Governor told and comes to the conclusion that his current mission is dull and unexciting in comparison. The story is also an eye-opener for Bond who, before hearing the tale, had passed judgment on Rhoda who was one of the guests at the party.
In ""Risico"" James Bond is sent by M to investigate a drug smuggling operation based out of Italy that is pumping narcotics into England. M instructs Bond to get in touch with a CIA informant, Kristatos, who in turn tells Bond that a man named Enrico Colombo is behind the racket. Bond gets close to Columbo’s mistress, Lisl Baum, by posing as a researching author. When Bond sets out to find more information on Colombo from her, he is captured by him and brought aboard Colombo's ship, the Colombina. While in captivity Colombo informs Bond that Kristatos is actually the one in charge of the drug smuggling operation and that he is being backed by the Russians. On the next day, the Colombina arrives at Santa Maria, where men are loading another shipment. Bond, Colombo, and the crew of the Colombina attack the warehouse and discover Kristatos inside. While trying to escape, Kristatos is shot by Bond.
""The Hildebrand Rarity"" also predated the publication of the collection, appearing first in the March 1960 issue of Playboy. In this adventure, Bond is on holiday in the Seychelles Islands with his friend, Fidele Barbey. Through Barbey, Bond meets an uncouth millionaire named Milton Krest who has offered the two the job of aiding him in the search for a rare fish named ""The Hildebrand Rarity"". After agreeing to help, the three as well as Mrs. Elizabeth Krest set off aboard the Wavekrest in search of the fish. During the journey Bond learns that Mr. Krest verbally and physically abuses everyone around him, specifically his wife whom he punishes with the use of a sting ray tail he dubs ""The Corrector"". After finding the Hildrebrand Rarity, the party returns to the Wavekrest and returns to port. Along the way Krest gets drunk and insults Bond and Barbey and also schedules an appointment for his wife with ""The Corrector"".
During the same night Bond hears Mr. Krest choking, after which Bond discovers Krest has been murdered and the rare fish was stuffed into his mouth. So as not to be entangled in an investigation for the murder of Krest, Bond throws him overboard and cleans up the scene of the crime. The following day after the Wavekrest has reached port no one knows what had happened to Mr. Krest and all presume he fell overboard. Bond investigates both Barbey and Mrs. Krest and finally comes to the conclusion that Mrs. Krest had murdered him in an act of revenge for the way in which Milton Krest had treated her, although she never admits to committing the crime and Bond never asks.
Four of the five short stories in For Your Eyes Only were adapted into James Bond comic strips which were published in the British newspaper the Daily Express and subsequently syndicated around the world:
The first three stories were adapted by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky and are largely considered a depature from what readers of the comic strips were used to, focusing more on character details and the plot of the story. More so than any other adaptation, ""Risico"", ""From a View to a Kill"", and ""For Your Eyes Only"" are considered to be the most faithful adaptations of Ian Fleming's original work. All three stories were reprinted in 2004 by Titan Books and are included in the Goldfinger collection.
The fourth adaptation, ""The Hildebrand Rarity"", did not appear until six years after the comic strip versions of the other stories. It was adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak. This adaptation was reprinted by Titan Books in the early 1990s and again in 2004 as part of the Octopussy collection.
The remaining story in the collection, ""Quantum of Solace"", is one of only three Ian Fleming James Bond stories that has never been adapted as a comic strip. The other two are ""The Property of a Lady"" and ""007 in New York.""
"
1039,/wiki/Bill_Tanner_(Literary),"Bill Tanner is MI6's Chief of Staff. Tanner is a regular literary character from Fleming and Gardner's novels, as well as Kingsley Amis' Colonel Sun, but has never been considered a regular cinematic character. He appears infrequently in the novels, but is a larger, more regular character in the later continuation series by John Gardner and Raymond Benson.
Tanner has spent over a decade as M's number two and has signs of visual age due to the strenuous nature of the job. Superb in a crisis, and blessed with a dry sense of humour, Tanner is also Bond's staunchest ally in the Service, and they often enjoy lunching together or a round of golf when off-duty. A family man, Tanner is just a little envious of Bond's freedom.
When the original 007 turned up dead in France, Tanner had to inform M, and discuss the cause of death and potential replacements. Tanner suggested James Bond, who had seen success in previous missions, and was a personal friend of Tanner's. After Bond completed his second assassination, he was due to receive his place in the 00 program. After getting settled in his new office, Tanner called him up to meet with M, and accompanied him to his offices, informing him of a new assignment that would be less straightforward than an assassination. Tanner went in ahead of Bond, and helped to brief the man on his assignment to find 007's killer before he left the office as the new 007.
Bond tests his shooting abilities at a targeting range before his invitation from M to attend a card game with him at Blades against Sir Hugo Drax. It is mentioned that the test scores will be passed to Tanner, and that only he and M have the privilege of knowing the accuracy scores of agents.
Tanner initially questions Bond's future field effectiveness after letting himself be poisoned by Rosa Klebb which almost killed him.
When Bond returns to London, brainwashed by the KGB, Tanner is very dubious of Bond's story and discourages M from seeing him. He offers to see Bond before M in case of a plot, though M refuses, and invites Bond to lunch which he likewise abstains. When Bond subsequently attempts to assassinate M in his office, Tanner had already called in the head of security to Miss Moneypenny's desk. The two throw themselves into the room and subdue Bond dragging him into Tanner's office.
M conveys his concern at 007's state of mind but is optimistic Bond can be ""un-brainwashed"" by Sir James Moloney. He asks Tanner to arrange for Moloney to see Bond and reinstate his pay. Then to pull the file on Francisco Scaramanga and organize his elimination to be Bond's next assignment to ""test"" his skills and abilities following Bond's mental recuperation.
When Sir Miles is kidnapped from his home, Quarterdeck, Tanner takes over as temporary head of MI6. He, Ronnie Vallance and Bond investigate the crime scene and work out a plan to find M. Tanner sends Bond to Greece, where he is to rendezvous with head od station G, Stuart Thomas' agents and pursue Colonel Sun Liang-Tan.
"
1040,/wiki/Dr._Julius_Gorner,"Dr. Julius Gorner was a fictional political radical and drug trafficker who ostensibly was an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical industry. The character served as the primary antagonist of Sebastian Faulks's 2008 James Bond continuation novel, Devil May Care.
Born in Lithuania, Gorner was born afflicted with Main de Singe, or Monkey's hand, in his left hand, meaning that his left thumb was not opposable, and his hand was covered in thick hair. He later studied Politics, Economics, and Chemistry at Oxford, where he was a generally unlikable student who cheated without needing to, and refused to believe that he did not already know everything. He eventually came to believe that his fellow students disliked him because he was foreign, and he then swore vengeance against all of England.
in 1967, Gorner would attempt to destroy England by trafficking heroin into the country. His accumulation of Opioid drugs caught the attention of the SIS, who sent Agent 007 to investigate him. He agreed to play Bond at tennis on the court that he had rigged for cheating by raising and lowering the net to give himself impossible shots to return and make Bond's balls hit the net every time. In their third set of games, Gorner's minion Chagrin was removed from the security room by Scarlett Papava, whose sister was effectively Gorner's captive, due to Gorner keeping her happy with a steady supply of drugs at no cost to her. He chose Papava as his captive because her father, who was one of his professors at Oxford, had spoken to him of another man he knew afflicted with Main de Singe, which infuriated Gorner and caused him to wear a white glove on his left hand thereafter.
It then became his goal to destroy England, which he planned to do by creating a massive influx of heroin to destroy the young people. He created the heroin in a desert fortress in Iran, which was staffed by opium addicts that he paid in heroin until they died. In order to quicken England's heroin addiction, Gorner sent an Ekranoplan, a submarine-airship, bearing a Union flag to attack Stalingrad with soldiers carrying fake British passports to facilitate war. Bond foiled his plan, but Gorner had him followed and sent Chagrin to Moscow in case that happened. Chagrin was unsuccessful, and Gorner himself tracked Bond down to Paris where he attempted to kill Bond discreetly while a band played loud enough to drown out the silenced bullet. Bond caused a distraction by revealing Gorner's disfigured hand, and Gorner ended up committing suicide to avoid letting Bond win. He did this by diving off a bridge with a wounded leg into a boat's propeller.

1041,/wiki/Bad_Salzuflen,"Bad Salzuflen is a town and thermal spa resort in the Lippe district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is featured briefly in Anthony Horowitz's 2015 James Bond continuation novel Trigger Mortis, set during the Cold War.
"
1042,/wiki/A_View_to_a_Kill_(film),"A View to a Kill, released in 1985, is the fourteenth entry in the James Bond series of films made by EON Productions, and the seventh and last to star Roger Moore as British Secret Service Agent, Commander James Bond. It is also the final Bond film to have Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, which had began with Dr. No. It was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. Wilson also co-authored the screenplay along with veteran screenwriter Richard Maibaum.
The title itself is adapted from Ian Fleming's short story ""From A View to a Kill"", contained in the For Your Eyes Only collection of short stories released in 1960; however the title is where the similarity between short story and the film end, making this the second completely original Bond film after The Spy Who Loved Me. At the end of Octopussy during the famed ""James Bond Will Return"" sequence, it listed the next film as ""From A View to a Kill"", the name of the original short story; however, the title was later changed a few months before filming for unknown reasons. The original title ""From A View to a Kill"" was taken from a version of the words to a traditional hunting song ""D'ye ken John Peel?"": ""From a find to a check, from a check to a view,/From a view to a kill in the morning"".
James Bond is sent to Siberia, where he finds 003 buried by an avalanche and recovers a microchip from the corpse. With the help of field agent Kimberley Jones, he escapes the ambushing Soviet troops. Back in England, Q informs M, Bond and the Minister of Defence that the retrieved microchip's design is an exact match of an advanced microchip resistant to electro-magnetic pulse damage manufactured by Zorin Industries, indicating the company is leaking top secret technology to the Soviets.
Along with Miss Moneypenny, the group then venture to the Ascot Racecourse to observe the company's owner, frenchman Max Zorin. Zorin's horse miraculously wins the race; Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a horse trainer, believes the horse was using drugs, but the screening prior to the race came back negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with Achille Aubergine, a local detective already investigating the accusations. During dinner at the Eiffel Tower, Aubergine is killed by Zorin's lover and henchwoman May Day, but not before Bond learns about Zorin's annual horse sale in a few weeks. The futile chase after May Day leaves Bond with 6 million in damages and a citizen's arrest on him, infuriating the minister.
Bond and Tibbett later travel to Zorin's stud in Chantilly, France where Bond poses as St. John Smythe, a horse dealer. They locate and break into Zorin's secret labs where they discover that Zorin is using implanted microchips to release the drug remotely, triggered by a switch in his cane. Even though Bond sleeps with May Day to cover up their nightly investigations, he and Tibbett are soon discovered and the latter is killed by May Day. Bond survives a deadly horse race and an attempt to drown him inside his car in a lake.
In his blimp, Zorin unveils his plan to destroy Silicon Valley in an operation he dubbs ""Main Strike"" in order to gain complete control of the microchip market. In San Francisco, Bond learns from Chuck Lee, a CIA operative, that Zorin is a psychopath as a result of failed steroid experiments by Nazi-turned-Soviet scientist Dr. Carl Mortner. General Gogol tries to reason with Zorin, who behaves outside protocol for KGB agents; but Zorin declares himself renegade from KGB. Bond later runs into rival spy and former lover Pola Ivanova, who tries to sabotage Zorin on Gogol's orders.
During his investigations about Zorin's ventures, Bond meets again with Stacey Sutton, a state geologist and heiress of Zorin's competitor in oil business. Back in Chantilly, Zorin tried to buy out hesitating Stacey, who is now threatend by Zorin's thugs. Bond and Stacey unveil Zorin's ""Main Strike"": He plans to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the Hayward Fault and the San Andreas Fault causing them to flood. A bigger bomb in an abandoned mine will destroy a ""geological lock"" that prevents the two faults from moving at the same time. The timed detonations would cause a massive double earthquake, thus destroying Silicon Valley, the world's leading microchip manufacturing area.
Bond and Stacey reach the mine, but Zorin soon begins to flood it with the first set of explosives. May Day, feeling betrayed after being left behind to die in the mine, changes sides and aids Bond in removing the bigger bomb that would destroy the lock. Doing so eventually costs her her life.
In the finale, Bond manages to grab a rope attached to Zorin's airship as he leaves the mine. During the flight Bond gets the rope tangled in the Golden Gate Bridge. Zorin and Bond then fight upon the bridge resulting in Zorin falling to his death into the San Francisco Bay.
Bond is awarded with the Order of Lenin by Gogol, who amusingly claims the Soviet economy needs Silicon Valley. Bond is missing in action, but Q's espionage robot finds him and Stacey together in her shower.

1044,/wiki/Gonzales%27_Henchman,"Gonzales' henchman is a fictional unnamed mercenary serving under Hector Gonzales. He later takes command of Gonzales' men after his death at the hands of Melina Havelock. The minor villain appeared in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only, portrayed by stuntman Clive Curtis.
Handing him the PPK, Gonzales recognizes the weapon as the standard issue firearm of the British Secret Service and orders Bond to be taken away, presumably to be shot. It is at this moment that the Cuban hitman is shot in the back by Melina, who has been lurking in the woods.
In the ensuing chaos, Bond knocks one of his captors into the pool and escapes over the villa wall into the woods. The henchman manages to fire several shots at Bond, but ultimately is unable to catch him. Eventually, the spy manages to get to the relative safety of Melina's Citroën 2CV, and a car chase through the Spanish countryside ensues.
With the henchman and two cars full of mercenaries in pursuit, Bond accidentally topples the 2CV in a crowded village. As 007 and Melina (with the help of some villagers) attempt to roll the car onto its wheels, a traffic pile-up begins with a bus blocking the mercenaries' path through the cramped street. After gesturing wildly at the bus driver to reverse and clear the street, the henchman fires his pistol menacingly in the air. The threat has the desired effect, but by the time the bus has moved the 2CV is already up-righted and escaping.
Continuing the chase through winding hill roads, the henchman's car attempts to force Bond off the road twice. Although the first attempt succeeds, the second attempt fails miserably as Bond's quick braking sends the henchman's car careering into the second car behind him. The henchman's vehicle is sent tumbling down the hillside, landing on its roof on the road below. Bruised and bloodied, the henchman stares in horror as the second car hurtles around the corner, hitting the car a second time and sending its occupants spinning in circles.

1046,/wiki/Daniel_Craig,"Daniel Wroughton Craig (born March 2, 1968) is an English actor. Born the year after the release of You Only Live Twice, Craig is the first James Bond actor to be born after the start of the film series, also making him the first Bond actor to be born after Ian Fleming died. Much media attention has also been given to him for being the ""blondest"" official Bond actor.
He was born in Chester, the son of a steel erector and an art teacher. He was brought up in Prescot, near Liverpool. He attended Hilbre High School, West Kirby (near Liverpool) and played rugby at nearby Hoylake Rugby Club. He moved to London when he was 16 to join the National Youth Theatre, later securing a place at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.
As early as February 2005, Craig had been named in the media as a possible contender to replace Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. On April 6, 2005 Craig was reported to have been signed by EON Productions as part of a three-film contract worth £15 million, however, this news was later debunked by the BBC who contacted EON for an official report. According to Craig, MGM offered him the role but the Broccoli family never got in touch with him.        
Finally, on October 14, 2005, Eon Productions named Daniel Craig as the sixth actor to portray 007, taking over from Pierce Brosnan. Craig signed a three-film contract, with the first, Casino Royale, to begin filming in January 2006 with an expected release of November 2006.
The announcement was made at noon in London at HMS President, a Royal Naval Reserve station at St. Katharine Docks, on the banks of the River Thames downstream of Tower Bridge.

His first marriage, from 1992–1994, was to actress Fiona Loudon, with whom he has a daughter, Ella. After that marriage ended, he later was in two serious relationships, one with German actress Heike Makatsch that ended in 2001, and with American film producer Satsuki Mitchell, which lasted from 2004 to 2010. He was also rumored to have had an affair with his Layer Cake co-star Sienna Miller in 2005.
Craig and Rachel Weisz, his co-star in the film Dream House, started dating in December 2010 and were married on June 22, 2011 in a small ceremony in New York with only four guests including Craig's daughter Ella and Weisz's son Henry. The couple had been friends for many years before their relationship turned romantic while working on Dream House. Craig and Weisz had their daughter, born on September 1, 2018.

1047,/wiki/Haitian_motorcyclist_(Jacques_Duckins),"The Haitian motorcyclist (dubbed ""Haitian Gang Member"" in film credits) was a fictional unnamed criminal who worked for billionaire environmentalist and Quantum member, Dominic Greene. Portrayed by actor Jacques Duckins, the character served as a minor antagonist in the 2008 James Bond film, Quantum of Solace.
This unnamed thug has been sent by Dominic Greene to follow Camille Montes around, probably serving as a backup for Edmund Slate, who is tasked with killing Camille. The thug however does not know how Slate looks, therefore he does not get suspicious when James Bond enters Camille's car instead. 
After having kicked Bond out of her car, Camille drives away, leaving Bond in a backalley somewhere in Port-au-Prince. The Motorcycle Thug arrives quite irritated, and gets knocked out by Bond, who steals the motorcycle and chases Camille.

1048,/wiki/Chagrin,"Phan Sinh Quoc, known professionally Chagrin, is a character in the 2008 James Bond Novel Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks.
While other countries were occupying his native Vietnam, Chagrin was part of a group of people who underwent surgery to remove their emotions, but Chagrin's surgery went slightly bad and disabled part of his face, making him resemble a stroke victim, and left an unhealing flap of skin on his forehead which he hid with a kepi hat. After being released back onto his country, Chagrin and a group of like-minded associates would go to villages and rip out the tongues of christian preachers in villages, and would drive chopsticks through the eardrums of the children who listened to it.
For this, he was branded as a war criminal and went into private employ for Dr. Julius Gorner. Under Gorner, Chagrin was ordered on several occasions to rig his tennis matches for him by raising and lowering the net to his advantage. He was later put in charge of overseeing the warehouse housing Gorner's Ekranoplan which he planned to attack the Soviet Union. In the warehouse, he found James Bond and Scarlett Papava, whom he took to Gorner's desert base. Shortly after, Papava escaped, and Chagrin was prepared to use his chopstick technique against Bond, but was ordered not to. In case Bond's suicide mission failed, Chagrin was sent to Moscow to watch for him. When he did find Bond, he ambushed he and Papava in a train where he was defeated and held out of the train compartment's window before hitting a tunnel and being decapitated.

1049,/wiki/Cleo_Daway,"Cleo Daway was a fictional Egyptology student and associate of Professor Giza. The character first appeared episode 4 (""Shifting Sands"") of the 1991 spin-off animated television series, James Bond Jr. and was subsequently adapted for John Vincent's accompanying novelisation, Sandblast!
Daway was a student of Egyptology, presumably studying under Professor Giza. She is deeply mistrustful of outsiders, and holds special contempt for those who seek to buy and sell artifacts of Egyptian heritage.
She first meets James Bond Jr. and his companions whilst they are visiting Egypt on an archaeological expedition; treating their presence with suspicion. Cleo joins Bond and the excavation party, as they return to the recently-discovered tomb of Pharaoh Hiphurrah. She warms to him as they discuss Egyptology, surprised that a foreigner would show interest in her cultural heritage. The party are trapped in the tomb after Trevor Noseworthy accidentally triggers an artificial earthquake with one of I.Q's gadgets. In a bid to escape, she and Bond discover a hidden treasure vault... and an underground warship belonging to Egyptian criminal, Pharaoh Fearo.
The pair are subsequently taken captive and the mad Pharaoh outlines his scheme to reclaim his supposed inheritance: the treasures of his ancestor, Pharaoh Hiphurrah, and the rich oil fields of the Sinai Peninsula. After a failed escape attempt, Fearo traps Bond and Cleo in a section of pipeline and prepares to begin stealing the crude oil for S.C.U.M.. They escape drowning by eroding the metal with acid, inadvertently flooding the vessel with oil and forcing it to surface. With the help of a local sheikh, Bond commandeers the vessel and Fearo is taken into custody. Cleo and Bond return to the burial site in time to save his entombed friends from suffocating. Returning to the hotel, Cleo tells Bond that while their cultures are too different for them to ""blend"", she wants to give him a memento of their time together.

1050,/wiki/AT-420_Sentinel,"AT-420 Sentinel/AT-600 Scorpion is an advanced rocket launcher that is seen in three James Bond games. The perks of the rocket launchers may vary for each game. 
The Sentinel and the Scorpion are fictional shoulder fired, reloadable, multi-launch rocket systems. The Sentinel can be fired in either unguided or TV-guided modes, while the Scorpion replaces the TV-guided mode with heat-seeking. The Scorpion is also available as a fixed weapon on some multiplayer weapon sets.
Both weapons use the same model. Drake uses one of those models in the last level, when the player vs him.
The M202 FLASH appears in the game as the ""AT-420 Sentinel"", though there are a few inaccuracies. It is incorrectly depicted as firing laser guided missiles. The four shot clip is shown extending from the front of the weapon instead of from the rear, there are no grips or sights, and there is only one hinged cover in the front (there should be a second one in the back to act as a stock).

The AT-420 is seen in various missions. It is just like the Nightfire one, with the difference the aspect and the form is not the same."
1051,/wiki/Barracuda_(submarine),"The Barracuda was a fictional top-secret supersonic midget submarine.

1052,/wiki/Clarence_Leiter,"Clarence Leiter was a fictional intelligence operative working for British Intelligence. Portrayed by Australian actor Michael Pate, the character appeared in the 1954 Climax! episode, Casino Royale and was a combination of the literary characters Felix Leiter and René Mathis.
The first screen interpretation of the Leiter character was in the 1954 CBS one-hour television adventure Casino Royale, broadcast as part of the dramatic anthology series Climax Mystery Theater, which ran between October 1954 and June 1958. For the American audience the Bond character from Casino Royale was re-cast as an American agent—""Card Sense"" Jimmy Bond, played by Barry Nelson—described as working for ""Combined Intelligence"", supported by the British agent, Clarence Leiter; ""thus was the Anglo-American relationship depicted in the book reversed for American consumption"", according to Jeremy Black. Leiter, who was an agent for Station S, was a combination of the novel's Felix Leiter and René Mathis and was played by the Australian actor Michael Pate.

1053,/wiki/Briony_Thorne,"Briony Thorne, also known by the codename 0013, was a fictional intelligence operative of the Double-O Section, an ultra-covert unit within the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6). The '00' prefix indicated a discretionary licence to kill in the performance of her duties. The character served as an ally in the James Bond comic strip, Fear Face, which ran in The Daily Express newspapers between January 18 and April 20, 1971.
While on a mission in Hong Kong, Briony was kidnapped by Ferenc Kress, who kept her under hypnotic drugs and framed her for selling out two fellow operatives to Chinese Communists. Kress then left her in Italy with a fake Canadian passport and a plane ticket to England. When she returned, she broke into the apartment of her former lover James Bond, where she explains herself, and Bond flips a coin to decide wether or not to believe her. She gives him the names ""Magnus Mining"" and ""Lambert"". Bond investigates them, but while he was away Bill Tanner broke in to his apartment, and held Briony captive until Bond returned and knocked Tanner out. The two then went to the home of Ivor Lambert where they were captured by him and Kress. Bond was able to slip his bonds and call the authorities. Briony's name was then cleared with the information gained from Kress, and she was re-instated as Agent 0013.

1054,/wiki/Blofeld_(Max_von_Sydow),"After Largo has secured the missiles, Blofeld turns in a video message that shows him in well-known manner only to chest height and with his white Persian cat in the arm, directly to NATO to make his demands and thrusts in his innermost circle already sure of victory with champagne.
However, James Bond manages to foil the plot and Largo is killed. What has become of Blofeld after this is uncertain, but since he is a survivalist, he is probably submerged and lurking somewhere in secret on a new opportunity to strike again one day.
Ernst Stavro Blofeld is a 1.93 m tall, almost ascetic slim man in advanced middle years with mischievously sparkling blue eyes. His graying hair is cropped and he wears a manicured Henriquatre beard.
Dressed in a well-fitting three-piece, gray pinstripe suit with a wine-red bow tie and a delicately lilac-colored shirt, the sleeve cuffs are closed with solid gold cufflinks. From the breast pocket of his jacket protrudes a small piece of his reading glasses and his lapel is decorated with a red pin.

1059,/wiki/Ceyhan_Oil_Terminal,"Ceyhan Oil Terminal was a fictional pipeline terminus owned by Elektra King in The World Is Not Enough. It was operated by King Industries.
Sir Robert King has planned du built an 800-mile pipeline, delivering oil from Baku to the west, 'past the terrorists in Iraq, Iran and Syria', as Elektra explained to Bond. Apart from some stretches in Georgia and north-western Azerbaijan, the pipeline is nearly completed, when Sir Robert dies.
Elektra plans to complete the pipeline, the terminus is located in Ceyhan, Turkey, from where the oil is to be loaded in tankers, and shipped to Europe over the mediterranean sea.
Apart from the pipeline itself, the most important room at the terminal is the control room. Several desks with computers are facing a large screen wall, where the current status of the pipeline can be shown.
During the Renard incident, Elektra and M follow Bond's actions inside the pipe from here.
There is also a smaller area, connected to the main room through glass doors and windows. It is used by M and Bond to speak more privately.
A helipad is located outside of the main building. M arrives here by helicopter - and against her will she leaves in a different one.
The building where the oil terminal scenes were filmed was actually the Motorola plant at Swindon, Wiltshire. The plant had been opened by the Queen in 1998 and was very futuristic at that time. Motorola sold the plant in 2009, and in 2010 the iconic 'tube' on the roof, resembling a pipeline, was dismantled.
When looking at the maps seen in the movie, the filmmakers used quite some fantasy when drawing the border line between Turkey and Syria, and they also changed the actual location of the city of Ceyhan. 
The real city is located 30 km away from the mediterranean coast.

1062,/wiki/Ford_Taunus_Ghia,"The Ford Taunus is a large family car built by the German Ford subsidiary.
Although the name sounds similar to that of the American Ford Taurus, it is a completely different model. The German Ford works introduced the 'Taunus' name (named after a mountain range in Germany) in 1939, and kept it until 1982, when the Ford Taunus was replaced by the Ford Sierra. Although, the Turkish Otosan company built their version of the Ford Taunus until the early 90s.
The model seen in the movie belongs to the 'TC2' generation, the major 1976 facelift of the TC1 (1970-1975), making it a brand-new car by the time of the filming. Most likely, Ford supplied cars for the making of The Spy Who Loved Me.
In late 1979, the Taunus got another facelift.
As the vehicle seen in the movie has chrome mirrors and a vinyl roof, this is a top-spec 'Ghia' variant. The white front indicators, and orange side repeaters are a special configuration for the Italian market.
While on Sardinia, James Bond and Anya Amasova find themselves hunted by Karl Stromberg's henchmen. After a first attempt by an assassin riding a modified Kawasaki Z 900 fails, this black Ford Taunus comes out of a dirt road and chases 007's white Lotus Esprit.
The Taunus, with a driver, two gunmen on the backseat, and Jaws on the passenger seat, somehow manages to keep up with the Lotus, while its occupants fire handguns at the Esprit. Bond uses the cement sprayer mounted behind his rear licence plate to spray cement on the Ford's windscreen, making the driver lose control. 
After driving onto the curb on one side, he gets back onto the road, only to drive off a cliff. The car falls down into a remote hut, a small explosion happens. Apparently, only Jaws survives the crash.
As the Taunus is very closely related to its British sister model, the Ford Cortina, the henchmen inside the car are called 'Cortina Gunmen' in the credits.

The Blonde Beauty is one of Drax's Girls. Bond first encounters her at Venini Glass, where she works as a receptionist. She asks if she can interest him in something, and he says he will have a look around, to which she tells him to go anywhere he wishes. As he leaves, she has a devious look on her face.
After Bond lands in the jungle, he sees a woman in a white robe walking under a waterfall and into the woods and follows her to a temple. Once she arrives, the woman turns around to reveal herself as the blonde receptionist. She lures Bond inside the temple, where there is a waterfall. She walks over a bridge and signals for him to follow her, as the other girls reveal themselves. Bond walks closer to the water and is dropped in by a trap door as a python swims into the water, and the blonde beauty and her friends watch him with devious smiles. Bond manages to escape the trap.
Her final fate is unknown, but she presumably dies when the space station explodes.
The Blonde Beauty seems to be the leader of Drax's Girls, due to the fact that her uniform was different from all of the other girls when they lure Bond into a trap.

1066,/wiki/Christmas_Jones_(Denise_Richards),"Dr. Christmas Jones is a fictional nuclear physicist who appeared in the 1999 James Bond film The World is Not Enough. She was portrayed by American actress and former fashion model Denise Richards.
Mid-way though the film, Bond arrives at a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan, working undercover to investigate the terrorist Renard's presence at the facility. Posing as a Russian nuclear scientist, Bond is introduced to Dr. Christmas Jones, an American nuclear physicist working in Russia to dismantle nuclear warheads, reducing the Russian inventory in line with treaty obligations. On their initial encounter Jones treats Bond with a combination of mistrust and mild contempt, pre-empting a discussion of her unusual forename with a warning not to bother with any Christmas jokes - she has apparently heard them all.
After gaining access to the silo, Bond notices Renard removing a GPS locator card and a half quantity of weapons-grade plutonium from one of the nuclear devices. Before Bond can kill him, Christmas blows his cover by pointing to an inconsistency between Bond's appearance and his age as stated on his stolen ID card. Renard steals the bomb and flees, leaving everyone to die in the booby-trapped missile silo. Bond and Christmas narrowly escape the exploding silo with the weapon's locator card.
In Azerbaijan, Bond discovers that the stolen bomb has been placed in the King oil pipeline attached to an inspection rig and is heading rapidly toward the oil terminal. Bond and Christmas enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Christmas discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig and a large section of the pipe is destroyed by the remaining explosive charge. Bond and Jones are presumed killed and the villainess, Elektra King, decides to take advantage of the opportunity and abduct M.
Meeting up with Bond's ex-KGB ally, Valentin Zukovsky, the group goes to Istanbul, where they realize that Renard is planning to insert the stolen plutonium into a submarine's nuclear reactor (the submarine would subsequently be hijacked by Elektra and was captained by Zukovsky's nephew). The resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. Elektra's pipeline is planned to go around Istanbul, dramatically increasing the value of her own oil.
After a further assassination attempt by Elektra's hired thugs, Bond and Christmas are captured. Christmas is taken aboard the submarine, which was seized by Renard's men. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a garrotte. Bond escapes with the help of Zukovsky, frees M and kills Elektra. He then dives after the submerging submarine, boards it and frees Christmas. Following a fight, the submarine starts to dive, and hits the bottom of the Bosphorus, causing its hull to rupture. Bond catches up with Renard and fights and kills him. Bond and Christmas escape the submarine, leaving the flooded reactor to detonate safely underwater. They are subsequently shown celebrating Christmas in Turkey, culminating in a romantic liaison that is unintentionally spied on by MI6 using a new body sensor designed by R, who soon turns it off, lying to M by saying it is an error likely caused by a premature form of the ""Millennium Bug"" said to occur in 2000.

As they sit in traffic Bond improvises a distraction by knocking an intoxicated reveler's liquor over the car's interior and igniting it with Volpe's cigarette lighter. He flees the burning vehicle into the Junkanoo crowds, pursued by Volpe and her men. Shot in the ankle, Bond inadvertently leaves a blood trail which leads them to the Kiss Kiss Club, where 007 attempts to mix in with the dancers.
Volpe approaches Bond as he is dancing with another woman. Assuming Volpe is his wife, the woman abruptly leaves, and the pair begin slow-dancing. As they dance another henchmen takes aim at Bond from behind a nearby curtain. Bond notices in time and spins Volpe into the path of the bullet, piercing her spine and killing her instantly. Her henchman flee and 007 drops Volpe's corpse into a nearby chair, quipping to the couple sitting at the table ""mind if my friend sits this one out? She's just dead.""

1070,/wiki/Chester_MacLean,"Chester MacLean was a fictional American employed by Industrias Scolopendra as harbourmaster at their shipyard on Isla de Pinos. He previously served as chief enforcer to Cuban industrialist, Scolopendra. The character served as a minor antagonist in Steve Cole's 2016 Young Bond novel, Heads You Die.
During the early 1930s, Chester MacLean served as chief enforcer to Scolopendra during his rise to power. When the industrialist wanted something to happen, MacLean saw to it. The villain did not ask for details. Gradually, MacLean was side-lined by Scolopendra's manipulative NKVD business partner and lover, La Velada. By 1934, MacLean was relegated to the position of harbourmaster at the shipyard on Isla de Pinos overseeing the construction of an enormous log raft designed to transport timber - and, secretly, smuggle poison-laced counterfeit bank notes into Great Britain as part of a Soviet plot to destabilize the country. In April, he faked the loss of timber during a storm and sold it cheaply to a competitor; resulting in construction of the raft falling behind schedule. United by their common detestation of La Velada, MacLean was paid by Scolopendra's daughter Jagua to get dirt on her. 
In the late summer 1934, an American CIP asset named Sarila Karatan broke into Scolopendra's poison laboratory on Isla de Pinos and stole a strongbox containing poisoned currency. Subsequent investigation by La Velada revealed that the operative had infiltrated the lab using a stolen shipyard truck; which had been parked outside the gates of the yard on MacLean's instruction. More damningly, a large amount of money had also been recently paid into his bank account. MacLean was abducted, beaten and taken to a suite at the Gran Casino in Havana by the villains' thugs - Ramón Mosqueda and El Puño. He remained unconscious there until Scolopendra and La Velada conducted his interrogation the following day. He failed to convince his boss of La Velada's duplicity and, despite his protestations of innocence, was shot through the head by Scolopendra after a coin toss. A bogus laundry truck came to collect the body at five o'clock.

1073,/wiki/Gareth_Mallory_(Ralph_Fiennes),"Lieutenant Colonel Gareth Mallory (also known by the initial ""M"") is the current Head of Secret Intelligence Service — also known as MI6 — and is portrayed by actor Ralph Fiennes.
Introduced in the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall as the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, Mallory assumes the role of M following the untimely death of the outgoing Head of MI6.
Mallory is a former Lieutenant Colonel in the SAS, who served in Northern Ireland and spent three months as a hostage in the hands of the IRA. His distinguishing trait is that during his wrongful incarceration he steadfastly refused to divulge confidential information; a fact that seems to have impressed the originally cynical James Bond.
Later on, during the inquiry, Raoul Silva, who recently escaped after disabling MI6's defense system, breaks in with two other henchmen of his and plans on shooting M but Mallory manages to jump in the way and took the bullet to his left shoulder. Despite the injury, Mallory helped Eve and 007 by picking up a dead police officer's Glock 17 and shoots one of Silva's henchmen and after James shoots the fire extinguishers which created a smokescreen, Mallory helped Miss Moneypenny in evacuating the parliamentary ministers and inquiry members out of the courthouse building. He was treated by medics and was given an arm sling. Returning to MI6 after the firefight, Mallory discovered Q and Bill Tanner making a complex electronic trail for Silva to single-handedly to follow, hoping to help Bond and M lure Silva and his henchmen into a trap. To their surprise, he allows them to continue, warning them to not get caught by the Prime Minister. At the end of the film, due to her death, Mallory is given M's alias and position as head of MI6, with the former giving the top secret document to Bond in his next assignment, of which Bond accepts.
When M reads on the headlines about a collapsed building in Mexico, he shows 007 the Guardian newspaper in his office and asked him the purpose of his trip, replying that he was on a holiday. M grounds him temporarily from the field for taking the trip without an official authorization and that it could stir up an international incident. Soon after, a man from the Joint Security Service named Max Denbigh (who is named by the alias of 'C' by Bond), enters the office whom M introduces to 007. M is in the middle of a power struggle between Denbigh's Nine Eyes Committee which would eliminate the need for the ""00"" section.
When it emerges that C is an agent of villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, M, Q, Moneypenny, Bond, and Tanner travel to arrest C and stop the launch of the Nine Eyes programme. En route they are ambushed and Bond is kidnapped. M and the others escape and proceed to wait for C in his office, arrest him and shut down Nine Eyes before it launches; in an ensuing struggle, C is killed. Bond comes close to executing Blofeld but then lets him be arrested by M.
Five years after James Bonds's retirement, M continues as the head of MI6. He has commissioned new agents, including a new 007, Nomi.
Ultimately, M reneges, re-enlisting Bond as an active agent and re-instating his title of 007. He then puts Bond on the mission to take down Safin, with Q and the new agent Nomi (who had been given the 007 title) as support. Bond succeeds in his mission, but is killed in the process, forced to remain behind to ensure the success of the missiles that take out the factory which creates the Project Heracles nanobots. Afterwards, M shares a drink in Bond's honor at MI6 along with Moneypenny, Q, Nomi and Tanner.
Mallory has a very aloof, cynical and sarcastic personality. However, he respects M for her years of service to her country, and isn't cruel to her for her retirement. He is, however, skeptical to the fact that Bond came back after he had the perfect chance of retirement. He remains skeptical and doubtful towards Bond. He also sends Moneypenny to spy on him. It is revealed that Mallory fought against the IRA, and was a prisoner of war at the time. He was possibly embittered by this experience to the point of borderline social detachment to everybody else. This shows both loyalty and bravery hidden beneath Mallory's shell. He eventually comes to respect Bond and fights alongside him during the battle against Silva. He is highly intelligent, as he was the first appointed as the next head of MI6 after his predecessor died.
When first cast in Skyfall, many people speculated that Fiennes would play Bond's arch-nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld as Fiennes is often cast as a villain in most movies.
During the filming of Skyfall, the fact that Fiennes was to become the new M was a closely guarded secret.
Ralph Fiennes is the youngest actor in the role of M, being 49 when he first appeared in the role.

1076,/wiki/Anya_Amasova,"When the British HMS Ranger and the Soviet submarine Potemkin are captured, M recalls James Bond from a mission where he is currently in a cabin located in Austria. While leaving Bond is ambushed by a Russian team lead by Sergei Barsov, but is able to kill Barsov in self-defense prior to parachuting off the mountain, unbeknownst that the agent was Amasova's lover. Later, Anya has also been recalled from a mission by General Gogol of the KGB.
Anya meets Bond during a show at the Pyramids in Egypt, where her thugs fight with Bond when she believes he has killed Aziz Fekkesh, an Egyptian contact whose body has been found in one of the pyramids. The real killer was Jaws.
However, they become formally introduced to one another in Cairo when they both arrive at Max Kalba's club. After spouting various biographical details to each other (for example, Anya is aware of Bond's doomed marriage), they attempt to outbid one another for a secret microfilm. When Kalba is killed by Jaws, they travel across Egypt tracking the microfilm. After Anya ultimately outwits Bond for the microfilm (but Bond had reviewed it), they report to the Abu Simbel temple where Gogol and M have decided to work together to find out how and why their submarines are being stolen while at sea.
For most of the film, Bond and Anya have the same mission objectives and try to achieve the same goals often by attempting to outdo one another, during which they fall in love. While travelling to Sardinia by train they share a meal together and while Anya is preparing for bed in her carriage, having politely declined Bond's offer of a nightcap, she is attacked by Jaws. Bond hears the sounds of a struggle over the noise of the train and arrives just in time to save her from being killed. After a brief fight, Jaws is dispatched out of a window and Bond returns to Anya, who tends to a cut on his shoulder before they kiss and ultimately spend the night together. On Sardinia, Anya accompanies Bond to meet Karl Stromberg posing as his wife. Afterwards, Anya learns that Bond killed her lover. She then tells him that she will ultimately have revenge once their mission is complete.
Anya is later captured by Stromberg and held captive at Atlantis, Stromberg's undersea base. Bond sneaks aboard and rescues her. As the mission reaches its end, she points her gun at Bond, only to discover that she is too in love with him to kill him.
Anya (pointing gun at Bond), tells him: ""The mission is over, Commander"". At that moment, as Anya is tightening her finger on the trigger, the cork pops off of a champagne bottle that Bond is in the process of opening. Anya smiles, stifling a giggle, and Bond says ""In my country, Major, the condemned man is usually allowed a final request"" to which she says ""Granted"". Bond then suggests that they get out of their wet clothes.
When James and Anya's escape pod goes into the ship Bond saved from Stromberg's 'instruments of Armageddon', Q, M, Fredrick Gray and Anya's superiors from Russia look inside the window at James and Anya making love in the luxury bed in awe. ""James!"" Anya says as she's the first one in the pod to see the duo's superiors.
Anya was depicted as cunning, devious, aloof and fearless. She was vengeful and became tenacious to kill James Bond after he killed her boyfriend. However, despite this, unfortunately for Sergei, she is also capable of forgiveness and letting go of these grudges as she has shown to have forgiven Bond after she realized Bond actually killed Sergei in self-defense. She is shown to have nerves of steel, since she was completely calm in holding Jaws at gunpoint.
It was planned to have Amasova make a cameo in Moonraker (which was released in 1979), as the woman in bed with General Gogol, but this never happened.

In the first section set in Paris, James Bond commandeers a taxi to follow May Day who has parachuted from the Eiffel Tower. Roadblocks and police cars are out to stop Bond, who can shoot his pistol at them to get them out of the way. The display is in three sections - an overhead map of Paris, a small 3D view from the car's point of view, and a scanner showing May Day's height. James must arrive at the right location to catch her as she lands.
In the second section, James must help Stacey Sutton escape from San Francisco City Hall, which is on fire. Each room is displayed from a side-on perspective. James must collect useful objects to get through the floors of the building, such as keys to open doors and buckets of water to stop the progress of the fire.
In the third and final section, James must collect the code numbers to stop the detonation of Zorin's bomb. Bond runs around the mine, avoiding rockfalls and long drops. Among the objects he can pick up are a grapnel gun (to fire ropes upward which he can climb to safety) and a plank of wood to bridge gaps. May Day is also somewhere in the mine.

Sir Robert King, head of King Industries comes from a wealthy Scottish family, owning a large countryside estate. However, his daughter Elektra identifies more with her maternal Azerbaijani heritage, and decides to live in Baku instead. Nevertheless, Glen Darrock Estate most probably was Elektra's childhood home.
Since the estate stretches over a large area, it also has its own chapel, like many old estates with no town or village nearby. Another example of this is Skyfall Lodge, another Scottish estate with its own chapel.
Apart from the chapel, nothing is seen of the estate grounds.
The route leading to the estate passes a gate with a small guardhouse. For Sir Robert's funeral, local police officers are guarding the gate.
Around the estate are vast stretches of park-like landscape, most probably also belonging to the King family.
The King family chapel is in fact the Gothic Temple, belonging to Stowe House in Buckinghamshire. Stowe House (completed in 1683) is a large estate, which today houses Stowe School. The main gate of the King Estate was also filmed on the Stowe House grounds - the building is called Oxford Gate House in real life.

In the year 1928, the Laird of the castle died, and it went to the American brothers Algar and Randolph Hellebore. The two, alongside Dr. Perseus Friend, used its basement as a laboratory for their experiments with Human Growth Hormone (HGH). It was full of secret passages and rooms, and served the Hellebores nicely as both a home and a workplace.
Randolph enacted tight security to keep unwanted variables out of his test pool of chemically altered eels that densely populated loch Silverfin, and so had several barracks erected on the grounds, and added a fence around the outside of his land.
When the young James Bond and George Hellebore decided to stop Randolph's highly dangerous experiments, they ended up burning it down, which did not bother George, as the castle, which, built in the traditional Scottish style more resembled a very large house, had long since lost its charm, and after years of living with his deranged father had long felt like a prison. After setting the documents and vials of SilverFin serum on fire, the boys doused the laboratory with flammable chemicals, which caused the castle to burn as well.

It was the first trainer aircraft to be equipped with a turbofan powerplant and was exported to a wide range of countries as a military trainer. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the Russian Air Force in 1991, the newly formed service found itself with hundreds of L-39 aircraft, the majority of which were surplus to their training requirements.

1095,/wiki/Diamonds_Are_Forever_(film),"Diamonds Are Forever is the seventh film in the EON Productions film franchise, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. It was released in 1971. The film stars Sean Connery as James Bond in the actor's sixth and final official film appearance as the spy. Connery would later portray Bond again for the seventh and last time in the unofficial Bond film Never Say Never Again,12 years later in 1983, and lend his voice for the character in the 2005 video game adaptation of From Russia with Love.
In the film, a diamond smuggling investigation leads 007 to Las Vegas, where he uncovers an extortion plot headed by his nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
Relatively little of the original novel survives the adaptation to film, though many characters from the original book, plus the idea of Tiffany being a diamond smuggler, are retained, so it isn't a complete ""rewrite.""
The test subject sits upright, preparing to shoot Bond as he scrambles towards the mud bath. Bond runs towards the mud bath and pulls on a cord which is linked to a huge tank containing more liquefied mud which is directly above the test subject. As the cord is pulled, Bond ducks by the mud bath as a stream of mud is dropped from the tank onto the test subject, who struggles to get out of the mud. He splutters but is unable to escape as the mud suffocates him but just before he sinks under the mud, he grunts. Bond stands up by the mud bath. He pulls his sleeve up and places it in the mud, searching for the test subject. He pulls the head of the submerged corpse above the surface of the mud, but it's still covered in mud. He finds a pistol that produces a jet of water and uses this to wash the mud off the corpse's face. Once it is washed off, he realises the person he killed isn't Blofeld, but a handsome young man. He lets go of the body and lets it sink under the mud, just as Blofeld arrives with two armed guards. Bond overpowers the guards and then manages to tie Blofeld to an operating table which he pushes into a huge lake of steaming mud. ""Welcome to Hell, Blofeld,"" he quips.
Meanwhile, huge quantities of South African diamonds are being stolen but have not been sold on the market. Suspecting that the stones are being stockpiled to depress prices, M orders Bond to assume the identity of a professional diamond smuggler called Peter Franks to infiltrate the smuggling operation and find out who the stockpilers are.
With the help of fellow smuggler Tiffany Case, and amidst the bright lights of Las Vegas, he uncovers a plot by Blofeld (who didn't die in the cave; Bond had killed another duplicate instead) to create a laser satellite capable of destroying any target on Earth. He uses this weapon to selectively destroy nuclear installations in America, Russia, and China, holding the world to ransom in an international auction, with nuclear supremacy going to the highest bidder.
A notable part of the plot of the movie involves Blofeld's use of the industrial properties of a recluse Nevada multimillionaire by the name of Willard Whyte, the character being a thinly veiled version of Howard Hughes.
The film features a very unusual couple of henchmen: Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. There is a strong suggestion that they are involved in more than just a professional relationship; they appear to be homosexual, although the film never explicitly makes that clear. Throughout the film, they use several interesting ways of assassinating their victims, from the use of a scorpion to kill a South African dentist, tying the feet of Plenty O'Toole to a metal plate and drowning her in a swimming pool, and attempting to incinerate James Bond alive in a crematorium furnace.
Also memorable are the female guards placed by Blofeld over Willard Whyte, named Bambi and Thumper.

Unbeknownst to both the fighter pilots and the Devonshire's crew, the frigate was being used in Carver's plot to provoke war between China and the United Kingdom in order to secure broadcasting rights in the former.

Believing it to be an aerial torpedo fired by the MiGs, Commander Day sent a message to the Admiralty and proceeded to abandon ship. Only seventeen crewmen escaped and they were promptly executed by Carver's men using Chinese weaponry.

Melina's decision to feed Max spared her life as she was shielded from the gunfire. She is startled by the noises and rushes topside, only to see both of her parents shot and dying almost instantly.
The Greek police identify Gonzales using Melina's description. Through a detective agency, Melina tracks Gonzales to a villa outside Madrid, Spain. After Gonzales receives a payment from his employer, Aris Kristatos' henchman Locque for the Havelock murders, he finds that Bond has been snooping around his party. Bond is searched and his firearm is confiscated, to which Gonzales remarks Bond is part of MI6 as his pistol is a standard issue Walther PPK, and for him to be ""taken away"". Immediately afterward Melina, hiding in nearby bushes, shoots him in the back with her crossbow simultaneously as he dives in to the swimming pool. In the resulting chaos Bond and Melina escapes.
Gonzales's death raises the ire of Bond's superiors, who ordered him to interrogate Gonzales, ""not perforate him"" (although Bond was not the killer). Bond saves his skin by pointing out (the not-yet identified) Locque was the connection they needed. This also causes Melina to resume her vendetta as she realises Gonzales was only the pawn in the murder of her parents.

1114,/wiki/Agent_XXX,"When the British HMS Ranger and the Soviet submarine Potemkin are captured, M recalls James Bond from a mission where he is currently in a cabin located in Austria. While leaving Bond is ambushed by a Russian team lead by Sergei Barsov, but is able to kill Barsov in self-defense prior to parachuting off the mountain, unbeknownst that the agent was Amasova's lover. Later, Anya has also been recalled from a mission by General Gogol of the KGB.
Anya meets Bond during a show at the Pyramids in Egypt, where her thugs fight with Bond when she believes he has killed Aziz Fekkesh, an Egyptian contact whose body has been found in one of the pyramids. The real killer was Jaws.
However, they become formally introduced to one another in Cairo when they both arrive at Max Kalba's club. After spouting various biographical details to each other (for example, Anya is aware of Bond's doomed marriage), they attempt to outbid one another for a secret microfilm. When Kalba is killed by Jaws, they travel across Egypt tracking the microfilm. After Anya ultimately outwits Bond for the microfilm (but Bond had reviewed it), they report to the Abu Simbel temple where Gogol and M have decided to work together to find out how and why their submarines are being stolen while at sea.
For most of the film, Bond and Anya have the same mission objectives and try to achieve the same goals often by attempting to outdo one another, during which they fall in love. While travelling to Sardinia by train they share a meal together and while Anya is preparing for bed in her carriage, having politely declined Bond's offer of a nightcap, she is attacked by Jaws. Bond hears the sounds of a struggle over the noise of the train and arrives just in time to save her from being killed. After a brief fight, Jaws is dispatched out of a window and Bond returns to Anya, who tends to a cut on his shoulder before they kiss and ultimately spend the night together. On Sardinia, Anya accompanies Bond to meet Karl Stromberg posing as his wife. Afterwards, Anya learns that Bond killed her lover. She then tells him that she will ultimately have revenge once their mission is complete.
Anya is later captured by Stromberg and held captive at Atlantis, Stromberg's undersea base. Bond sneaks aboard and rescues her. As the mission reaches its end, she points her gun at Bond, only to discover that she is too in love with him to kill him.
Anya (pointing gun at Bond), tells him: ""The mission is over, Commander"". At that moment, as Anya is tightening her finger on the trigger, the cork pops off of a champagne bottle that Bond is in the process of opening. Anya smiles, stifling a giggle, and Bond says ""In my country, Major, the condemned man is usually allowed a final request"" to which she says ""Granted"". Bond then suggests that they get out of their wet clothes.
When James and Anya's escape pod goes into the ship Bond saved from Stromberg's 'instruments of Armageddon', Q, M, Fredrick Gray and Anya's superiors from Russia look inside the window at James and Anya making love in the luxury bed in awe. ""James!"" Anya says as she's the first one in the pod to see the duo's superiors.
Anya was depicted as cunning, devious, aloof and fearless. She was vengeful and became tenacious to kill James Bond after he killed her boyfriend. However, despite this, unfortunately for Sergei, she is also capable of forgiveness and letting go of these grudges as she has shown to have forgiven Bond after she realized Bond actually killed Sergei in self-defense. She is shown to have nerves of steel, since she was completely calm in holding Jaws at gunpoint.
It was planned to have Amasova make a cameo in Moonraker (which was released in 1979), as the woman in bed with General Gogol, but this never happened.

1115,/wiki/General_Golgov,"Golgov arms cartelGeneral Golgov was a fictional Russian military general and the head of a shadowy arms smuggling cartel. He functioned as the primary antagonist of the 1998 James Bond video-game, James Bond 007, for the Nintendo Game Boy.
Dissatisfied with the direction of global politics following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian General Golgov was responsible for setting up an arms smuggling ring; amassing an army to crush the West in retaliation for Russian nuclear disarmament. James Bond follows the smuggling pipeline to arms dealer, Oddjob, and later to Kurdistan. Pawns in the General's plans, the rebel leaders, Sadam and Khatar, were subsequently used by him to destabilise Kurdistan and make it ripe for invasion. Bond foils his plans in Kurdistan and infiltrates Golgov's hidden base in central Russia. He finds that the General has captured ally, Zhong Mae, and tied her to one of his five nuclear missiles. Bond confronts Golgov, who attacks him in an armed mechanical suit. 007 defeats him, but the General triggers the launch sequence for the missiles with his dying breath. Bond subsequently disarms the weapons.

1116,/wiki/Eurocopter_AS355,"The Eurocopter AS355 is a twin-engine light helicopter originally manufactured by Aérospatiale. The AS355 first appeared in the 1997 James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies as a helicopter owned and operated by the Carver Media Group Network in Vietnam. An AS355 F1 was subsequently featured in 1999's The World Is Not Enough as an overgrowth-clearing helicopter utilised by King Industries.
After discovering the wreck of the British ship HMS Devonshire in the South China Sea, James Bond and Wai Lin, a Chinese spy on the same case, are captured by the henchmen of media mogul Elliot Carver and are taken by AS355 to the CMGN tower in Saigon, Vietnam. After escaping the building, the pair grab a BMW R1200C motorbike and are chased through the streets of Saigon by the helicopter. Its pilot eventually attempts to mow down the pair using the aircraft's main rotor, but is outmanoeuvred and crashes in flames.
Whilst investigating the activities of oil heiress Elektra King at a caviar factory owned by Valentin Zukovsky, James Bond fends off an assassination attempt using two AS355 helicopters with buzz saw pendants, known as aerial side-trimmers. The devices are essentially a string of rotating buzzsaws affixed to the bottom of a helicopter. In normal operation, the pilot navigates his aircraft into position alongside overgrowth, engages the saws, and slices through the vegetative foliage. In the hands of King Industry's assassins, the blades cut through wooden platforms and even 007's BMW Z8, whilst gunmen fire from its exposed cockpit. Bond uses a ground-to-air rocket from his Z8 to shoot down the first aircraft and utilises a gas pipe and flare gun to destroy the second.

1124,/wiki/007:_Licence_to_Thrill,"During the pre-show, the audience stands and are briefed by the director of the British Secret Service, M via a 'live' video feed from MI6's headquarters in London. They are informed that they are standing in one of MI6's most closely-guarded secrets - a high-tech training facility that travels the world disguised as an ordinary theme park ride. She notes that the audience members have applied for a position in the 00 Section and provides them with a test to accompany 007 on his latest mission via a video feed from Bond's Q Branch-designed sunglasses. 007 (and the recruits) are tasked with rescuing Dr. Callie Reeves, a seismologist who has been seized by an international ""techno-terrorist"" named Gunther Thorne. Dr. Reeves has developed revolutionary new technology designed to release tectonic plate pressure, controlling future earthquakes. Thorne, however, has other plans for her research - intending to harness it to trigger earthquakes, rather than avoid them. The audience are then briefed on the technology behind Bond's glasses by Q, who is also testing a number of other gadgets including a machine-pistol disguised as a staple gun and a gas-chamber telephone booth. M concludes by telling the candidates that they will know if they have been selected for the 00 Section if they are ever contacted with the code-words 'Shaken not Stirred'. Before proceeding into the cinema, the audience members pass a ""Q Workshop"" with a Lotus Esprit and the Bede BD-5J micro-jet from the 1983 film Octopussy.
Upon entering the cinema room, participants are strapped into a simulator seats. The main show film begins with the traditional gun barrel sequence with a silhouette of James Bond. The gun barrel wipes across the screen to reveal the exterior of the Geo Thermal Institute (GTI), where Dr. Reeves delivers an enthusiastic announcement speech, flanked by two very athletic body guards. A helicopter whips through the air and hovers above the grand stand. The audience scatters and the body guards sweep Dr. Reeves off the grand stand. The helicopter fires a missile that destroys a Guard Shack in a terrific explosion. Through a billow of smoke emerge a trio of high-powered motorcycles led by Gunther Thorne. Gunfire explodes from their machine guns. One of the bikers gets SHOT and crashes. Thorne races his motorcycle up on the Grand Stand to capture Dr. Reeves. James Bond, on a BMW motor bike, flies through the air and lands in front of one of Thorne's henchmen and knocks him out with a blow to the face. 007 shoots another and then activates the graphic overlay system of his shades. The high-tech viewfinder zooms in on Thorne as he ties Dr. Reeves to the back of his bike. She struggles as he races into the Thermal Institute.
Bond chases Thorne into the Institute interior. As he breaks through the smoke, one of Thorne's henchman swings a large metal pipe. Bond ducks and steers past him. A thug on a forklift tries to cut Bond off, bullets from his machine gun whiz overhead. Bond races past, dodging some falling barrels. As Bond closes in Thorne tosses a hand grenade, which explodes and forces Bond toward a closed emergency exit. Another henchman unloads a burst of gunfire. 007 picks up speed and launches rockets from his BMW bike. The exit explodes in a ball of flame, sending the henchman flying over Bond's head. Bond emerges on a road at the exterior perimeter of the institute and accelerates following the road. Up ahead, the road dead-ends into a steep dirt embankment. A barrier blocks Bond's way. He accelerates toward the embankment, hitting it at full speed and lands on train tracks. Up ahead Thorne's motorcycle (with Dr. Reeves tied on the back) drives up a ramp and into the boxcar of a moving train.
Bond hits the throttle, gaining on the train, and as he nears the boxcar the loading ramp is pulled inside. ""Q"" appears onto the screen via Bond's glasses and warns him about taking care of his equipment as Bond steers off the tracks to avoid Thorne's gunfire and heads into the thick bush of the forest. He makes it through and guns the throttle, trying desperately to catch up to the train. Bond hits a mound of dirt at tremendous speed and launches the bike into the air and onto a flat car of the train. Bond accelerates and drives up a stacked pile of cut lumber onto the top of the train; jumping off the motorcycle and landing on top of a boxcar. The bike skids, sparks flying, along the top of the boxcar knocking a gunman off the train and exploding; sending debris flying toward the audience. As Dr. Reeves and Thorne struggle, Bond is confronted by and brawls with a second man - a huge martial artist. Outmatched, the assailant whips out a large knife and is about to deliver his death blow when his head collides with a sign announcing a low-hanging tunnel; falling to his doom. The audience and Bond are plunged into darkness as they enter the tunnel. Back out of the tunnel, Bond continues along the top of the train. Up ahead, Thorne is forcing Dr. Reeves up a rope ladder that is suspended beneath a helicopter taking off from a flat car. Bond sprints toward the chopper as it rises into the air; leaping just in time to catch the bottom rung of the rope ladder that dangles beneath the helicopter.
007 swings wildly back and forth, narrowly missing several trees, as the pilot does his best to knock him from the ladder. Bond looks up in time to see Thorne standing in the chopper's doorway above him. Thorne tosses a grenade into the helicopter, and bails out alongside the pilot and Callie. The chopper explodes, fragments narrowly missing Bond as he free-falls towards the ground. As he falls, the freefall causes interference with Bond's head link transmission. He gains on the pilot, struggling with the him in hand-to-hand combat. Bond prevails knocking the pilot unconscious and pulling the ripcord. He slows just 50 feet from the water; noticing Thorne with Dr. Reeves taking off in a Zodiac below him, followed by two jet skiers. Bond draws his pistol and blows up one jet ski; the other skier is shot, falling into the water. Bond lands on the remaining jet ski, shrugs off the parachute and continues his relentless pursuit of Thorne. From his Zodiac Thorne fires at 007 with a high-tech handheld rocket launcher. Bond swerves over and around explosions until ramming the Zodiac with his jet ski. Thorne tries to shoot with the rocket launcher but is unsteady. Callie sees her moment and leaps from the boat into the safety of the water.

1125,/wiki/Hip_(Soon-Taik_Oh),"Lieutenant Hip is a fictional intelligence operative employed by the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6). The character appeared in the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun, portrayed by the late Soon-Tek Oh, and also appeared in the James Bond 007 tabletop role-playing game where he was given the name Chong Sun Hip.
Lieutenant Hip is first seen when James Bond goes to the Bottoms Up Club. He meets with Gibson to talk about the solex agitator, which is 95% efficient. When leaving the Bottoms Up club, Gibson is shot by Francisco Scaramanga. When Hip can't find the solex agitator, he arrests Bond and tells him he is taking him the station.

"
1126,/wiki/Cricket,"Cricket is a fictional henchman employed by photophobic criminal, The Worm. He is paired with his partner-in-crime, Slug. A one-shot henchman, he first appeared in episode 13 (""Pompeii and Circumstance"") of the 1991 spin-off animated television series, James Bond Jr.
As part of a scheme to loot a lost treasury in the buried city of Pompeii, the photosensitive criminal, The Worm, constructs several makeshift boring tanks from stolen military equipment. Cricket and his accomplice, Slug, pilot one of the vehicles and accidentally manage to crash it under a coastal road. Their activities draw the attention of James Bond Jr., whose sports car almost crashes into the collapsed section. They flee from their damaged tank and commandeer another one. Eventually, they cross paths with Bond and his car in the tunnel system. They corner him at a dead end of tunnel, but he manages to escape by driving up the wall and along the roof using retractable tyre spikes.
Later, Bond pursues their tank from behind and manages to sabotage its exhaust system using a rock - forcing its operators to stop and clear the blockage. With both villains outside, he and I.Q. sneak on-board and hijack it from under their noses. While Bond intercepts the Worm at the ancient city of Pompeii, Slug and Cricket manage to obtain yet another tank and give chase. Attempting to redeem themselves, they engage Bond's tank among the ruins and manage to drill a hole in their armour. Bond and I.Q. swerve into the villain's tank to avoid hitting a kidnapped tour guide - sending Cricket and Slug crashing into a huge column. To save the girl, Bond and I.Q. block the pillar's fall using their tank and are trapped inside.
Meanwhile, Cricket and Slug bring the Worm on-board and all three tunnel into the ancient treasury vault - loading up its treasure and accidentally triggering a lava eruption. As they escape through the tunnels, they are eventually met with a wall of water - the result of James Bond Jr. deliberately tunnelling into the ocean. The water quenches the flow and drives Worm's machine above ground. There, the soaking villains are surrounded by the Italian army. Although the Worm evades capture, both Cricket and Slug are taken captive and presumably incarcerated.
"
1127,/wiki/From_Russia_with_Love_(film),"From Russia with Love is the second film in the James Bond film series, and the second to star Sean Connery as Bond. Released in 1963 in the UK, the film earned over $78 million. It was written by Richard Maibaum and Johanna Harwood and was based on Ian Fleming's fifth Bond novel of the same name.
Following the financial success of Dr. No, United Artists greenlighted a second James Bond film. The studio doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions with $2 million, and also approved a bonus for Sean Connery, who would receive $100,000 along with his $54,000 salary. As President John F. Kennedy had named Fleming's novel From Russia with Love among his ten favourite books of all time in Life magazine, producers Broccoli and Saltzman chose this as the follow-up to Bond's cinematic debut in Dr. No. From Russia with Love was the last film President Kennedy saw at the White House on 20 November 1963 before going to Dallas. Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam - who went to work on Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. No's art director Syd Cain, title designer Maurice Binder was replaced by Robert Brownjohn and stunt coordinator Bob Simmons was unavailable and was replaced by Peter Perkins though Simmons performed stunts in the film. John Barry replaced Monty Norman as composer of the soundtrack.
The film introduced several conventions which would become essential elements of the franchise: a pre-title sequence, the Blofeld character (referred in the film only as ""Number 1""), a secret weapon gadget for Bond, a helicopter sequence (repeated in every subsequent Bond film except The Man with the Golden Gun), a postscript action scene after the main climax, a theme song with lyrics, and the line ""James Bond will return/be back"" in the credits.
Although un-credited, the actor who played Ernst Stavro Blofeld was Anthony Dawson, who had played Professor Dent in the previous Bond film, Dr. No. In the end credits, Blofeld is credited with a question mark. Blofeld's voice was provided by Viennese actor Eric Pohlmann. It is rumoured that author and James Bond creator Ian Fleming has a cameo appearance, in a location train scene, standing outside the train in grey trousers and a white sweater. Fleming reportedly visited the train set, and publicity stills exist of him alongside the Orient Express.
Peter Burton was unavailable to return as Major Boothroyd, so Desmond Llewelyn, who was a fan of the Bond comic strip published in the Daily Express, accepted the part. However, screen credit for Llewelyn was omitted at the opening of the film and is reserved for the exit credits, where he is credited simply as 'Boothroyd'. Llewelyn's character is not referred to by this name in dialogue (and would not be until The Spy Who Loved Me 13 years later), but M does introduce him as being from Q Branch. Llewelyn remained as the character, better known as Q, in all but two of the series' films until his death in 1999.
Many actresses were considered for the role of Tatiana, including Sylva Koscina, Virna Lisi, Annette Vadim, and Tania Mallet. 1960 Miss Universe runner-up Daniela Bianchi was ultimately cast, supposedly by Sean Connery's choice. Bianchi started taking English classes for the role, but the producers ultimately chose to dub her voice over. The scene in which Bond finds Tatiana in his hotel bed was used for Daniela Bianchi's screen test, with Dawson standing in, this time, as Bond. The scene later became the traditional screen test scene for prospective James Bond actors and Bond Girls.
Katina Paxinou was originally considered for the role of Rosa Klebb, but was unavailable. Terence Young cast Lotte Lenya after hearing one of her musical recordings. Young wanted Kronsteen's portrayer to be ""an actor with a remarkable face"", so the minor character would be well remembered by audiences. This led to the casting of Vladek Sheybal, who Young also considered convincing as an intellectual. Several women were tested for the roles of Vida and Zora, and after Aliza Gur and Martine Beswick were cast, they spent six weeks practicing their fight choreography with stunt work arranger Peter Perkins.
Pedro Armendáriz was recommended to Young by director John Ford to play Kerim Bey. After experiencing increasing discomfort on location in Istanbul, Armendáriz was diagnosed with inoperable cancer. Filming in Istanbul was terminated, the production moved to Britain, and Armendáriz's scenes were brought forward so that he could complete his scenes without delay. Though visibly in pain, he continued working as long as possible. When he could no longer work, he returned home, and took his own life. His son, Pedro Armendáriz Jr., would later appear in Licence to Kill.
Joe Robinson was a strong contender for the role of Red Grant but it was given to Robert Shaw. Shaw built himself up for the role and wore lifts to give him height.
Director Terence Young's eye for realism was evident throughout production. For the opening chess match, Kronsteen wins the game with a re-enactment of Boris Spassky's victory over David Bronstein in 1960. Production Designer Syd Cain built up the ""chess pawn"" motif in his $150,000 set for the brief sequence. A noteworthy gadget featured was the attaché case issued by the Q-Branch. It had a tear gas bomb that detonated if it was improperly opened, a folding AR-7 sniper rifle with twenty rounds of ammunition, a throwing knife, and 50 gold sovereigns. A boxer at Cambridge, Young choreographed the fight between Grant and Bond along with stunt co-ordinator Peter Perkins. The scene took three weeks to film and was violent enough to worry some on the production. Yet Robert Shaw and Connery did most of the stunts themselves.
After the unexpected loss of Armendáriz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from rewriting by Richard Maibaum during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key elements were still to be filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young conceived of moving the training exercise on a Bond double to preface the main title, a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to re-film Lotte Lenya's lines.
Behind schedule and over budget, the production crew struggled to complete production in time for the already-announced premiere date that October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into the water with Art Director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft sank into 40–50 feet (12–15 m) of water, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera for the full day's work. A few days later, Bianchi's driver fell asleep during the commute to a 6 a.m. shoot and crashed the car; the actress' face was bruised, and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed two weeks while these facial contusions healed.
The helicopter and boat chase scenes were not in the original novel, but were added to create an action climax. The former was inspired by Hitchcock's North By Northwest, and the latter by a previous Young/Broccoli/Maibaum collaboration, The Red Beret. These two scenes would be shot in Istanbul, but were moved to Scotland; the speed boats could not run fast enough due to the many waves in the sea, and a rented boat filled with cameras ended up sinking in the Bosphorus. A helicopter was also hard to get—the special effects crew nearly got arrested trying to get one at a local air base. The helicopter chase was filmed with a radio controlled miniature helicopter. The sounds of the boat chase were replaced in post-production since the boats were not loud enough, and the explosion, shot in Pinewood, got out of control, burning Walter Gotell's eyelids, and seriously injuring three stuntmen.
Photographer David Hurn was commissioned by the producers of the James Bond films to shoot a series of stills with Sean Connery and the actresses of the film. When the theatrical property Walther PPK pistol didn't arrive, Hurn volunteered the use of his own Walther LP-53 air pistol."" Though the photographs of the ""James Bond is Back"" posters of the US release airbrushed out the long barrel of the pistol, film poster artist Renato Fratini used the long barrelled pistol for his drawings of Connery on the British posters.
For the opening credits, Maurice Binder had disagreements with the producers and did not want to return. Designer Robert Brownjohn stepped into his place, and projected the credits on female dancers, inspired by constructivist artist László Moholy-Nagy projecting light on to clouds in the 1920s. Brownjohn's work started the tradition of scantily clad women on the Bond's title sequences.
From Russia with Love is the first Bond film in the series with John Barry as the primary soundtrack composer. The theme song was composed by Lionel Bart of Oliver! fame and sung by Matt Monro, although the title credit music is a lively instrumental version of the tune beginning with Barry's brief James Bond is Back then segueing into Monty Norman's ""James Bond Theme""). Monro's vocal version is later played during the film (as source music on a radio) and properly over the film's end titles. Barry travelled with the crew to Turkey to try getting influences of the local music, but ended up using almost nothing, just local instruments such as finger cymbals to give an exotic feeling, since he thought the Turkish music had a comedic tone that did not fit in the ""dramatic feeling"" of the James Bond movies.
In this film, Barry introduced the percussive theme ""007""—action music that came to be considered the 'secondary James Bond Theme'. He composed it to have a lighter, enthusiastic and more adventurous theme, in order to relax the audiences. The arrangement appears twice on the soundtrack album; the second version, entitled ""007 Takes the Lektor"", is the one used during the gunfight at the gypsy camp and also during Bond's theft of the Lektor decoding machine. The completed film features a holdover from the Monty Norman-supervised Dr. No music; the post-rocket-launch music from Dr. No is played in From Russia with Love during the helicopter and speedboat attacks.
From Russia with Love is frequently considered the best of the James Bond film series by many fans and critics, and by actor Sean Connery (although even critical opinion varies greatly). The film is also often considered the ideal Bond film that each film strives to aim for. Michael G. Wilson once stated, ""We always start out trying to make another From Russia with Love and end up with another Thunderball."" In 2004, Total Film magazine named From Russia with Love the ninth-greatest British film of all time.

1128,/wiki/Bambi_and_Thumper_(Larson_%26_Parks),"Thumper is the name of one of two women acting as guards for Blofeld to prevent anyone from seeing the reclusive Willard Whyte. The character were developed especially for the 1971 film Diamonds Are Forever and was portrayed by Trina Parks.
The exhausted and beaten Bond looks to be easy prey for these nimble karate experts and they quickly seize the advantage and hold Bond's head underwater. However, it soon turns out to be a tactical error for the ladies. Transferring the fight to the deep end of the pool, negates their martial arts skills and Bond is quickly able to turn the tables on the girls and holds them both underwater until Felix Leiter and his men show up. Bond continues to hold the ladies underwater for 30 seconds as they thrash about. By now their struggle indicates that they are desperate for air. 
Bond lifts their heads up for a quick breath but then it's right back under immediately while he talks amusedly to Leiter, who complains about Bond wasting time in the pool. The bubbles and struggles of the women underwater indicate that they are near drowning at this point and Bond senses that they might be ready to talk. Bond first releases Thumper, and she desperately uses her last breath to swim to the poolside while Bond continues to hold Bambi under.  Thumper knows that her partner needs air so she complies by pointing to the shed below where Whyte is being held. Then Bond releases his hold on Bambi, who desperately swims to the side. Bond, heading for Whyte, leaves behind the exhaustedly coughing women who are holding on to the sides of the pool, gasping for air.
Thumper's final fate is unknown.

1129,/wiki/Colonel_Luis_Toro,"Colonel Luis Toro was a fictional Latin American military officer. An antagonist portrayed by actor Ken Norris, the character appeared in the pre-title sequence of EON Productions' 1983 James Bond film, Octopussy.
In the pre-title sequence of Octopussy, James Bond is dispatched to destroy an enemy spy plane. Travelling under the guise of a horse trainer, Bond disguises himself as Colonel Toro (complete with a fake moustache, uniform and ID card) in order to access the facility. However, the real Toro notices 007 entering the aircraft hangar and blows his cover before he can complete his mission. Minutes later, Bianca spots Toro's paratrooper guards driving away with a captured Bond and helps free him. 007 attempts to escape in an Acrostar Bede Jet hidden in the back of his Land Rover's horse trailer and uses one of his enemies' own heat-seeking ground-to-air missiles to destroy the hangar with Toro inside.

1130,/wiki/Felix_Leiter_(Bernie_Casey),"Felix Leiter is a fictional character invented by Ian Fleming in the James Bond books, who also appears in the Bond movies. In the films, Leiter works for the CIA, and assists Bond in his various adventures. He was portrayed by the late Bernie Casey in the 1983 film Never Say Never Again. This was the first interpretation of Leiter as an African-American.
In 1983 Kevin McClory, one of the original writers of the novel Thunderball, produced Never Say Never Again, a re-make of the 1965 film Thunderball. McClory's rights to the film were held separate to those of Eon Productions, although he had been one of the producers for the original Thunderball adaptation. The film marked the return of Sean Connery to the Bond role; he spoke with Bernie Casey, saying that as the Leiter role was never remembered by audiences, using a black Leiter might make him more memorable. Smith and Lavington consider Casey to be ""the most compelling Felix Leiter since Jack Lord"", although again there was little in the script for him to do.

1131,/wiki/Fan_generated_content,"Fan generated content. As with many franchises, the James Bond franchise has encouraged numerous fans projects. These projects often include creation of written works (fictional, fan fictional and review literature), visual or computer-assisted art, music, or applied arts and costuming.
Fangames are video games made by fans based on one or more established video games. Many fangames attempt to clone or remake the original game's design, gameplay and characters, but it is equally common for fans to develop a unique game using another only as a template. Though the quality of fangames has always been variable, recent advances in computer technology and in available tools have made creating high-quality games easier.
A fan film is a film or video inspired by a film, television program, comic book or a similar source, created by fans rather than by the source's copyright holders or creators. Fan filmmakers have traditionally been amateurs, but some of the more notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in quality, as well as in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to full-length motion pictures.
There have been many James Bond Podcasts over the years since Podcasting came to the fore, but undoubtedly one of the biggest is James Bond Radio .
Formed in 2014 and hosted by James Bond fans Tom Sears and Chris Wright, the podcast has become extremly popular with Bond fans around the World, and has resulted in multiple gatherings of the ""JBR Army"" as they like to refer to themselves as.
The format of the show is fortnightly and discussion based, mainly Tom & Chris' in depth look at, and love of, the films, but over the 150+ episodes they have had notable interviews including Sir Roger Moore, Terry Bamber, Caroline Munro, Madeline Smith, Peter Lamont, Alan Tomkins , Bruce Glover  and Martine Beswick.
In 2016, James Bond Radio added a monthly ""Music of Bond"" podcast, hosted by Warren Ringham (of Q The Music Show) and John Williams.  In addition a reguar feature is wonderfully contructed episode ""featurettes"" from Dan Gale.
The popularity of the show, and undoubted expertise of hosts Tom & Chris have led to some notable media exposure including The Times, TalkSport Radio and BBC Radio 2.
Other noteable James Bond podcasts include BondCast, Being James Bond, Now Playing: The James Bond Movie Retrospective and James Bonding.
Additionally, Diminishing Returns is a general film show featuring James Bond Reviewer, Calvin Dyson, that is making its way through the entire Bond catalogue. Most episodes contain references or comparisons to James Bond.
Q The Music Show is a Tribute Show created by professional Trumpet player Warren Ringham as a tribute to the music from the James Bond Films.
Created in 2004, the group have become well known for their authentic and exciting performances of all the Bond Theme songs, as well as performing many of the series' incidental cues such as ""Bond '77"" or ""Backseat Driver"".
The group have appeared at fan events such as Bondstars and On The Tracks Of 007 and are generally regarded by the James Bond fans and fan organisations that have seen them as the greatest musical tribute to the films. At Bondstars they appeared at a celebration of the work of Peter Lamont, finishing with a rousing finale with Peter joining Q The Music on stage.
Regular supporters include Terry Bamber, who has worked on 7 James Bond films, as well as Caroline Munro and Madeline Smith.

1137,/wiki/Casino_Royale_(1954_TV),"Casino Royale is a television adaptation, released in 1954, of the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. This show was to be the first attempt at a screen adaptation of a James Bond novel. Though this is regarded as the first onscreen appearance of the character James Bond, this film's character is an American agent with ""Combined Intelligence"".
The show was low key and was more or less forgotten about after its initial showing until it was rediscovered in the 1980s by film historian Jim Schoenberger, with the ending and credits found later. The rights to this adaptation were eventually acquired by Metro Goldwyn Mayer at the same time as they gained the rights for the 1967 film version of Casino Royale. This would clear the legal pathway to enable them to make a canonical film of the same name in 2006. On December 1st 2020 MGM would officially release the film for free through YouTube Movies.
Act I ""Combined Intelligence"" agent James Bond comes under fire from an assassin: he manages to dodge the bullets and enters Casino Royale. There he meets his British contact, Clarence Leiter, who remembers ""Card Sense Jimmy Bond"" from when he played the Maharajah of Deauville. While Bond explains the rules of baccarat, Leiter explains Bond's mission: to defeat Le Chiffre at baccarat and force his Soviet spymasters to ""retire"" him. Bond then encounters a former lover, Valerie Mathis who is Le Chiffre's current girlfriend; he also meets Le Chiffre himself.
Act II Bond beats Le Chiffre at baccarat but, when he returns to his hotel room, is confronted by Le Chiffre and his bodyguards, along with Mathis, who Le Chiffre has discovered is an agent of the Deuxième, France's external military intelligence agency at the time.
Act III Le Chiffre tortures Bond in order to find out where Bond has hidden the cheque for his winnings, but Bond does not reveal where it is. After a fight between Bond and Le Chiffre's guards, Bond shoots and wounds Le Chiffre, saving Valerie in the process. Exhausted, Bond sits in a chair opposite Le Chiffre to talk. Mathis gets in between them and Le Chiffre grabs her from behind, threatening her with a concealed razor blade. As Le Chiffre moves towards the door with Mathis as a shield, she struggles, breaking free slightly and Bond is able to shoot Le Chiffre.
Producer and Director Gregory Ratoff bought the rights to the Ian Fleming novel Casino Royale in May 1954. It was a six month option and Ratoff took this to CBS whom produced and broadcast this one hour episode for Climax!. Before the sale, the Casino Royale novel had not been very successful, and was even retitled and Americanized for its paperback issue. Fleming also needed money. Twelve months later, and after the TV screening, Ratoff bought Casino Royale outright in perpetuity for an additional $6000. Both sales including the option and the buy-out are considered to have been sold too cheaply and were two sales that Ian Fleming later regretted. With the money from the larger sale, Ian Fleming bought a Thunderbird car at the cost of £3000. Gregory Ratoff passed away on 14 December 1960. His widow in 1961 sold the rights to Charles K. Feldman for $75,000. Feldman would go on to make the James Bond spoof, Casino Royale (1967). It would not be made as an EON Productions film until Casino Royale (2006).

1138,/wiki/Dominique_Derval,"James BondJames Bond first heard about Domino during a briefing from M to all the double-0 agents in Europe. Bond had recognized her brother from a photograph, having seen him dead the night before at the Shrublands health clinic, and requests that he be allowed to investigate this potential lead as opposed to his original assignment.
Domino is seen when Bond is swimming in Nassau. Her foot gets stuck in a form of ocean floor, but Bond sets her free. She swims up to her boat and thanks Bond. Bond swims back to his boat with his Nassau contact, Paula Caplan. Paula takes care of their boat as Bond is about to learn more about Domino. Domino and Bond have lunch on the beach. But Quist spies on the two. A sign that Domino had to go back to the Disco Volante.
At the hotel Bond stayed in, Bond sees Domino with Largo. Domino was smoking a cigar as Bond bid in the game against Largo. Domino tells Largo that Bond pressed her to a drink. Domino and Bond slow-dance outside, but Largo collects her. At Largo's home, Palmyra, Domino is swimming when Bond visits. She leaves Bond with Largo to go make lunch. Largo invites Bond to the Nassau Junkanoo.
After being released by a repentant Kutze, she proceeds up to the ship's bridge to find Largo holding Bond at gunpoint. As he prepares to pull the trigger, Domino shoots him in the back with a harpoon. He turns and collapses dead on the ship's wheel, jamming the controls. Unable to move the body and with seconds to spare, Bond, Domino and Kutze leap overboard as the Disco Volante runs aground and explodes violently. The two are subsequently saved by the CIA and are carried off into the air by a sky hook.
Domino Derval was an impeccable French beauty and embodied all that James Bond found irresistible in a woman: She was intelligent, imaginative, humorous, sexually aggressive and courageous. Until she met 007, Domino was resigned to being Emilio Largo's mistress. On the one hand, she got used to the opulent lifestyle Largo offered her. However, on he other hand, she was essentially a prisoner in a golden cage in which he held her captive. Her freedom was limited. It was observed - if not by Largo himself, then his many henchmen. She spent her precious free time alone, went to the beautiful waters of her Nassau passion to swim and lived with Largo in her investment, Palmyra. More than the extravagant attires the frigid Largo offered her, however, Domino desired true love. The wish was fulfilled by her later relationship with James Bond. Domino's deferred courage manifests itself when she risked her life to help Bond to stop Largo's nuclear threat in the United States.

1139,/wiki/Amy_Goodenough,"Amy Goodenough was a fictional British student. From a privileged background, she was the daughter of ex-Royal Navy admiral, Sir Cathal Goodenough, and sister of Mark Goodenough. The character served as an ally in Charlie Higson's 2006 Young Bond novel, Blood Fever, and made a final appearance in his 2009 concluding novel, By Royal Command.
Initially planning on ransoming her, Zoltan grew attached to the girl - seeing her as an opportunity for redemption. They criss-crossed the Mediterranean for weeks, before arriving at Sardinia to unload their loot. There, tensions flared between the Magyar and his business partner, Count Ugo Carnifex. Asserting his dominance, the bandit seized Amy from Zoltan with the aim of wedding her to solidify his aristocratic pretensions; callously murdering her tutor with a Thompson sub-machine gun. Amy was thrust into a prison cell, cutting her hair short to spite the Count. Her sole friend was a local boy who worked in the kitchens named Stefano. Feeling sorry for her, he led the young James Bond to her cell during a carnival at the Palazzo. Much later, Bond would return to rescue her from her prison as the feud between Zoltan and Carnifex ignited into open violence. They were unable to prevent the Magyar and his Samoan lieutenant, Tree-Trunk, from destroying Ugo's dam: killing Carnifex and destroying the complex.
James, Zoltan, Tree-Trunk and Amy departed on horseback. Wanting to ""do something good"", the Magyar relinquished his claim on Amy, gave the pair a pouch of gold and set them on a course toward the eastern coast. With no mode of transport they quickly succumbed to exhaustion on a wide, dry, stony plain. Suddenly, they were attacked by Peter Haight on horseback - dressed in the costume of a Su Compoidori and wielding a sword. Zoltan returned and, ultimately, both men were unhorsed and impaled on their respective weapons. James and Amy acquired a small boat and attempted to return the delirious, mortally-wounded pirate to his ship; but before they could he demanded they throw him overboard to drown. Despite Bond's protestations, Zoltan fell overboard - it is left ambiguous as to whether it was by his own hand or Amy's. After spending time together on a beach, they sailed onward to La Casa Polipo - the home of Bond's eccentric cousin, Victor Delacroix - and were met by Ugo's vengeful sister, Jana. The James and Amy leapt into the ocean and, in her haste to get a clearer aim, Jana slipped on the rocks; meeting her end in a bed of sea urchins. James then helped Amy out of the water. After thanking James, she realized she must have stopped on one of the urchins as well. James then assured her that he knew just what to do.
In the interim, Bond and Amy had drifted apart after exchanging a couple of letters. Despite this, Amy would later tell him that she thought about him all the time. Now an orphan, she lived with her aunt and uncle; slowly recovering from the events of the summer. A year later, Amy attended Eton College's Fourth of June celebrations with her aunt, uncle and a distant cousin named Philip. There she unexpectedly met James and his aunt Charmian. Her comments about her cousin (combined with a science demonstration) led James to realize that there was a plot afoot to assassinate King George V in Eton's chapel. Having prevented the bombing by Communist terrorist, Dandy O'Keefe, Bond was furnished with a cover story by the Secret Intelligence Service - informing Amy and his aunt that he had hurt himself fighting with another boy over her honour. They watched the Parade of Boats, some cricket and had tea on the lawn. At Five o'clock they parted ways, but not before she kissed him and gripped his hands tightly.

Henderson tells Bond of his best route to get the Magic 44 decoding machine that M wants. It is through the head of the Japanese secret service, Tiger Tanaka. He teaches Bond the basics of Japanese culture and how a westerner should accustomise to it before he introduces Bond to Tiger.
After showing Bond the aspects of the ways of the Orient he will need, Dikko takes Bond to the impromptu headquarters of the Koan-Chosa-Kyoku, the Japanese secret service. Bond is hardly amused as the building is still in the process of construction. He takes Bond to an elevator and instructs him to go underground, where he meets Tiger.
After Bond completes his mission from Tiger by killing Dr. Shatterhand and destroying his Garden of Death, Tiger keeps his word and gives the Magic 44 device to Dikko. Dikko then visits the Ama island Tiger left Bond at in search of him several times. After a great deal of inquiry he leaves, oblivious that Bond was living there with Kissy Suzuki in an amnesiac state.
Dikko is based on the Australian journalist Richard 'Dikko' Hughes, a foreign correspondent who covered Asia for Australian and British papers before and after World War II. Together with 'Tiger' Saito (the basis for Tiger Tanaka) he accompanied Ian Fleming on a two-week background research tour of Japan prior to writing You Only Live Twice. Hughes was also the basis for the character 'Old Craw' in John Le Carre's The Honourable Schoolboy.

After her aunt May's reluctant retirement, She suggested Donalda be given her job as James Bond's housekeeper at his flat in Chelsea. She apprenticed with May for an interim period of two weeks and took over duties seamlessly.
After Bond had gone away on business, he called Donalda to the Cafe Picasso on King's Road, where he revealed that he believed the flat was being watched and did not want anyone to know he was back in town. Together they discussed his cover story and housekeeping notes regarding money before he asked Donalda to return to the flat and unlatch the back window. Donalda went back to the flat. Donalda found the subterfuge exciting and went back to the flat. She unlatched the window and went to the kitchen when everything went black.
She had been attacked by an unknown assailant and suffered a two inch cut on the back of her head. When Bond arrived, he sat her up and allowed her to vomit in a saucepan before making her some tea and asking what had happened. He called her a taxi to get her to a hospital to have her head examined and called May.

C also wants to create the ""Nine Eyes"" intelligence co-operation agreement between nine countries, and close down the '00' section in the process.
Now Mallory is the one holding C at gunpoint and plans to bring him down the spiral staircase leading to the bottom of the building to have him incarcerated. However, M is momentarily disturbed by the arrival of a helicopter come to pick up Blofeld and C uses the distraction to go for M's gun. In the ensuing struggle, Denbigh loses his balance and drops over the ledge of the platform, falling to his death several floors below. Tanner confirmed the death of Max Denbigh.
An appropriate touch to C's death is that he fell to his demise, much like how Andrew Scott's infamous character of Moriarty in the BBC's television drama Sherlock made his adversary fall. He owed him a fall, after all.

1143,/wiki/Goldeneye_007_2010,"GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter video game published by Activision. It is a reimagining of 1997 video game GoldenEye 007, itself based on the 1995 film GoldenEye. The game was officially announced by Nintendo at their E3 2010 conference presentation. The game was released on November 2, 2010 in tandem with another James Bond game, James Bond 007: Blood Stone. It took on the elements of a modern shooter while retaining a classic name. A remastering of the Wii game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in 2011, re-titled as GoldenEye 007: Reloaded.
Although Pierce Brosnan starred as James Bond in GoldenEye' and was featured in the 1997 game GoldenEye 007, subsequent Bond actor Daniel Craig's likeness and voice are featured in the 2010 game and the plot has been modified to fit with the current style of James Bond films. Judi Dench, who has portrayed M since GoldenEye, reprises her role for the game. With the exception of M, all other main characters from the film have had their appearances altered, though they still retain their original names.
Unlike the original video game and therefore movie, the whole story takes place after the Cold War due to the Soviet Union's replacement by the Russian Federation, so the story does not jump nine years ahead after the opening sequence. 
Since the release of Spectre, the events of the game have been contradictory and are rendered as non-canon.
The story is set some time after the events of Quantum of Solace but prior to Skyfall.  It begins with James Bond (007) and Alec Trevelyan (006) on a mission infiltrating a chemical weapons facility in Arkhangelsk, Russia, which is believed to be the source of weapons used by a terrorist cell to target British embassies around the world. The mission goes awry when Trevelyan is caught and apparently shot by General Arkady Ourumov. Bond escapes by detonating explosives he had placed throughout the facility, and fighting his way out, with playable options to use the facility's missile embankments to destroy attacking helicopters before stealing a motorcycle and chasing a plane on the runway. With its pilot killed in the firefight, Bond is forced to chase it off a cliff and steady the controls, fleeing Arkhangelsk.
Afterward, Bond reports on his mission, and receives intel on a phone call intercepted from Ourumov connects him to Russian gangster Valentin Zukovsky as Ourumov attempts to acquire a helicopter that has been modified to survive an electromagnetic pulse attack. Bond travels to Zukovsky's nightclub in Barcelona, Spain, and through Sergeant Garcia local police mole placed inside Zukovsky's nightclub, Bond is able to make contact with the Russian and inquires about the helicopter. Zukovsky directs him to an arms fair in Dubai before being killed by Xenia Onatopp, disguised as a waitress in Zukovsky's club and has the murder pinned on Bond.
Bond tracks Onatopp to the same arms fair Zukovsky mentioned, but is unable to stop Onatopp and Ourumov from stealing the EMP-resistant helicopter. He is, however, able to plant his smartphone on-board, and MI6 is able to track the helicopter to Severnaya, a remote base in Siberia which the Russians claim is being used to observe the effects of climate change. In reality, it is a tracking system for ""GoldenEye"", a series of nuclear weapons in orbit designed to disable an enemy target with an electromagnetic pulse upon detonation, except for Bond's new smart phone that was EMP hardened. Bond is unable to stop the theft of the GoldenEye weapons satellite, with Ourumov detonating one of the satellites in orbit so as to cover up the theft. Negotiating his way through the lower levels of the Severnaya facility, Bond rescues Natalya Simonova before being arrested by the Russian army.
Believing Bond and Natalya to be responsible for the GoldenEye blast, Russian Defense Minister Dmitri Mishkin interrogates the two in St. Petersburg, but is interrupted by Ourumov - now working for The Janus Group, a shadowy PMC, murders Mishkin and abducts Natalya. Bond pursues Ourumov through the Russian military archives, before hijacking a tank and chasing Ourumov. Ourumov leads Bond to a rail yard where he boards a train with Xenia. Bond derails their carriage by crashing into it with the tank, leading to a confrontation with Ourumov over his plan for the GoldenEye satellite. He attempts to pit Ourumov and Xenia against one another, but Xenia betrays Ourumov and kills him. Bond is able to help Natalya off the train before it explodes and Natalya admits she overheard Ourumov arranging a meeting with someone for that night.
Bond goes to the meeting in Ourumov's place and is shocked to learn that Trevelyan survived his execution at the hands of Ourumov and is now Janus, the head of the Janus crime syndicate and the mastermind behind the GoldenEye theft. Trevelyan expresses disdain for his previous life, claiming that where they once fought for Queen and country, their cause had become corrupted by bankers and financiers seeking to make billions of dollars in profit by manipulating the course of governments around the world. He then leaves with Natalya, who is instrumental to his plan now that Ourumov is dead.
MI6 traces Trevelyan to a solar energy station in Nigeria. Bond is able to infiltrate the facility, killing Xenia in the process. Trevelyan's plan is to steal billions of dollars from all the banks in London and everything the banks have touched (stock markets, financial records, etc.) before detonating the second GoldenEye satellite, erasing all evidence of the theft, using Natalia's fingerprint; Bond, however, is able to trick him into destroying his own supercomputers before telling Natalya to deorbit the satellite. Trevelyan then makes his way to the top of the satellite array to defend the override module that will sabotage it; after fighting Trevelyan, Bond is able to overload the facility control room, causing the entire facility to collapse around them. Bond shoots Trevelyan, sending him to his death over the edge of the tower. Natalya has a helicopter piloted by a Janus man at gunpoint to pick up James and they soon get away as the station is destroyed. Landing a few miles from the station, MI6 arrest the pilot while James and Natalia get out and look at each other before being interrupted by M's phone call, congratulating him about the station's destruction and wants a report. Natalia throws the smart phone away and James and Natalia soon kiss.
Since GoldenEye 007 serves as a re-imagining of the film, rather than an accurate portrayal, the game does have some noticeable differences. Levels have been altered to reflect the game's modified story. According to Craig Harris of IGN, ""GoldenEye still retains the basics of GoldenEye's story, but retells it in a way that makes sense with Daniel Craig's interpretation of James Bond."" Likewise, the game features modern game elements to coincide with other modern first person shooters, such as destructible environments and online multiplayer.
Eurocom has also added a few updated features while retaining some features from the original game. Instead of a watch, players use a mobile phone to scan documents, take photos, and communicate with MI6. The original GoldenEye 007 featured a cheat menu which is available from the start in the re-make. The game updates the AI-Bot system which is built upon Eurocom's previous game, Dead Space: Extraction. Each computer player possesses its own AI-bot system to make them dynamic and challenging. The game, despite having a regenerating health system, contains a throw back to the orginial GoldenEye 007's health system with the 007 Classic single player difficulty. In this single player mode, the player has non-regenerating health and can pick up armor like in the classic GoldenEye.
The game offers players several choices of controllers: Wii Remote with Nunchuk, Wii Zapper, Classic Controller, Classic Controller Pro, or a Nintendo GameCube controller. GoldenEye 007 also provides players using the Remote with Nunchuk or Wii Zapper with the ability to peer around cover by tilting the Nunchuk. The game includes twenty-five weapons based upon counterparts from the Bond franchise.
GoldenEye 007 features both offline split screen for up to four local players and online play for up to eight players. There are 10 multiplayer maps. There are four different game modes for offline multiplayer and nine different game modes for online multiplayer. Online multiplayer is provided through the free Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, and though up to eight players can connect to a game remotely, only one local player is allowed at a time. Multiplayer includes characters from the single player campaign, such as James Bond and Alec Trevelyan, as well as classic Bond-series characters including Jaws, Oddjob, and Julius No. Additionally, online multiplayer offers XP progression, unlockables and multipliers. Split screen combat provides over a dozen modifiers, including Paintball Mode from the original game.
During November 2006, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime announced that Nintendo was exploring the possibility of adding the Nintendo 64 classic GoldenEye 007 to the Virtual Console, despite a complicated situation in which the game's developer Rare is owned by Microsoft (producers of the rival Xbox 360 console) and the video game rights to the James Bond franchise are held by Activision. He stated, ""We would love to see it [on the Virtual Console], so we're exploring all the rights issues. On January 7, 2008, Xbox Evolved reported that an updated version of GoldenEye 007 would be released on Xbox Live Arcade. However on January 11, 2008, 1UP.com reported that a GoldenEye port (as opposed to a remake) had been in development at Rare for several months, but stated that the title would not be released on the [[Wikipedia:Xbox Live Arcade]|Xbox Live Arcade]] since ""Microsoft and Nintendo couldn't agree on the financial side of things"". As of November 2011, Microsoft has made no comment on further effort to acquire the rights to the game and release GoldenEye 007 on XBLA. It was revealed at E3 2010 that a new Goldeneye video game would be released for the Wii in November 2010. GoldenEye 007 is built on a modified version of the game engine from another Wii game by Eurocom, Dead Space: Extraction.
Originally, Free Radical Design (now Crytek UK) were approached by Activision to develop the game because former Rare staff were working there, however the deal was never finalised.
David Arnold, composer of every Bond film score since Tomorrow Never Dies, composed the game's score. Nicole Scherzinger performs the title song, a cover version of the film's theme which was originally performed by Tina Turner. The game's script is penned by Bruce Feirstein. Rory Kinnear reprises his role as Bill Tanner, M's Chief of Staff.
Reviews for GoldenEye 007 have been mostly positive. GameRankings's aggregated review score for the game is 83.77% as of May 4, 2011, based on 62 reviews, about 13% less than the original game. IGN awarded the game a 9.0 out of 10 and an Editor's Choice Award, praising its multiplayer component and its well-crafted story while criticizing the lack of voice chat. The reviewer, Craig Harris, concluded by acknowledging that the game—as of its release—is the Wii's best first person shooter. Gaming Nexus gave GoldenEye 007 an A–, stating, ""instead of standing in the original GoldenEye's shadow, Eurocom has created a brand new game that is just as compelling and addictive as the original."" GameSpot reviewer Tom McShea also praised the game, awarding it an 8.5 out of 10. Joystiq scored the game 4 out of 5. Nintendo World Report awarded the game an 8.5/10, with the reviewer stating, ""Frankly, I haven't seen a more impressive Wii shooter."" The Official Nintendo Magazine gave GoldenEye 007 a score of 90%. GameTrailers scored the game at 8.6 of 10, indicating that while most aspects are well-done, the game's performance suffers from inconsistent framerates, particularly during splitscreen play. They also derided the menus as ""bland"" and the ""not very crisp"" overall picture due to aliasing. Digital Trends' gave the game 8 of 10, complaining of the enemy AI's simplistic strategies and lack of adaptability. While the multiplayer gameplay was highly praised by the reviewer, the lack of voice chat was seen as a significant omission.
GamesRadar, although less positive, were still pleased with the result, awarding the game a 7 out of 10, stating that it was impossible for the game to live up to the original, but that it was still ""a damn fine, 'serious' shooter on the Wii, and that's saying something,"" adding that ""even without the limited options for mature action for Wii owners, GoldenEye 007 is a solid game in its own right."" In contrast, however, Game Informer was less impressed, giving the game a 6.5/10, calling it ""a lackluster game that fails to hit the same high notes of the original, or keep pace with modern shooters"".

At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Activision unveiled GoldenEye 007: Reloaded, a remastering of the Wii game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles. The game features high-definition graphics due to running on a new game engine, an achievement system, new ""Mi6 Ops Missions"", and PlayStation Move compatibility for the PS3 version. On September 14, 2011, Activision announced plans to release an exclusive PlayStation 3 bundle called GoldenEye 007: Reloaded - Double 'O' Edition, which would include access to the downloadable character Hugo Drax. The bundle would include a PlayStation Move motion controller, navigation controller, PlayStation Eye camera, and Sharp Shooter peripheral along with the game. The game was released on November 1, 2011 in North America and on November 4, 2011 in Europe.
GoldenEye 007 features online play for up to 16 players. There are 14 multiplayer maps. There are nine different game modes for online multiplayer. Online multiplayer can be used by Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, and though up to 16 players can connect to a game remotely, only one local player is allowed at a time. Multiplayer includes characters from the single player campaign, such as James Bond and Alec Trevelyan, as well as classic Bond-series characters including Jaws, Oddjob, and Julius No. Additionally, online multiplayer offers XP progression, unlockables and multipliers.
Reloaded has some changes to its Wii counterpart. There's new added gameplay, peripheral compatibility and improved graphics.

The character appeared in the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger and was portrayed by British actress Aleta Morrison.
Denise and the others members of Pussy Galore's Flying Circus are involved in Auric Goldfinger's ""Operation Grand Slam"" consists to infiltrate Fort Knox, being in charge to dispensing the Delta 9 nerve gas across the aera of the bank in order to kill 60,000 people. So, Goldfinger and his task force (led by Oddjob and Kisch) to smuggle an atomic bomb (created by Mr. Ling) into the vault. Such an action would make the gold radioactive and useless for 58 years, and that the value of Goldfinger's gold will increase many times, thus making Goldfinger the richest man in the world.
Upon the arrival of James Bond (as he was invited to personally witness the preparations of the operation after being captured by Goldfinger), Denise is seen landing her plane before greeting Galore, who assures her and the other pilots that they will get their assignments tomorrow night. She then dismisses them for the day before transporting Bond to Goldfinger's ranch, where the secret agent learns of Goldfinger's plot. With that in mind, Bond seduces Galore into foiling Goldfinger's plan, so she has Denise and the pilots to replace the nerve gas with a harmless one while alerting the U.S. government about Goldfinger's plan. It is unknown what happens to Denise and the other pilots following the deaths of Goldfinger and his men.
In the script, when we first meet her her name is listed as Althea but later on it says Denise. Either this was a mistake or the two were mashed into one.

He would later switch to extended 33-round magazines. The firearm was loaded with his signature military grade, depleted uranium rounds (an extremely unlikely choice for the real-life weapon). Attempting to identify Patrice, MI6 analysed shrapnel fragments of the rare ammunition found lodged in 007's shoulder. 
In the video game Nightfire, a modified Glock 17 with burst fire function stands in for the Glock 18. Despite being named the ""Kowloon Type 40"" (Kowloon is an urban area in Hong Kong, indicating the weapon is supposed to be a Chinese clone), the name ""Glock 17"" is written on the side. In the video-game adaptation of Quantum of Solace the Glock 18C is renamed ""GF18"" as a subtle reference to the film Goldfinger. It comes with a 30 round magazine and occasionally a laser sight.

Mulroy began work on the ""Hotshot"", a solar laser weapon using his expertise in the study of light. By way of a ""Parabolic Reflector"" dish and a ""Tele-Flector"" to focus the sun's rays into a powerful solar beam capable of targeting and creating a beam of light up to 2500 degrees Fahrenheit. Mulroy, however, was more interested in his work and the money he received for it than the destruction it caused.
Dr. No then used Mulroy's weapon as a means of eliminating his prominent business rivals while pinning the blame of the apparent terrorist attacks on the Eblis terrorist group. During this time, Mulroy stood by and oversaw the operation of his laser with enthusiasm.
Over time, this brought MI-6 agent James Bond to investigate the tanker Shirkahn, on which the Hotshot was mounted. Despite their best efforts, this lead to Bond shooting their fuel tanks and blowing up the ship.

1154,/wiki/Everything_or_Nothing_(Sountrack),"The soundtrack for Everything or Nothing was released on November 17, 2003 by Electronic Arts. soundtrack includes a full-length rendition of the James Bond theme. The in-game music was composed by composer Sean Callery, with additional music by Jeff Tymoschuk. Later in 2006, Electronic Arts published Callery's score appeared for sale exclusively on Rhapsody.
Sean Callery hints at his electro-orchestral tendencies here, but largely stays faithful to the melodies of the original. He waits till the main gameplay sequences to really assert his identity. For example, on ""To Arms"", he combines the exuberant orchestrations and punchy brass typical of David Arnold, with various percussive elements and electronic distortions typical of his 24 scores. The result has an enormous impact in the game and serves as some of the series' most appealing music on a stand-alone basis too.
While Everything or Nothing didn't receive a widespread music release, Sean Callery clearly intended the music to stand on its own. From a functional perspective, ""Silent Ascension"" enhances the infiltration feel of the game's stages with its electro-orchestral ambient soundscaping. However, it is also quite satisfying on a stand-alone level, thanks to Callery's creative use of solo and tutti strings. ""Kiss Kiss Fight"" is another impressive fusion of orchestral and contemporary elements that brings genuine chaos and intensity to the action sequences. ""Freefall"" turns the volume up a few notches and proves to be a gigantic action cue.
While most of the tracks on the score are electro-orchestral fusions, there is still plenty of diversity within. For example, the fusion of ""Tunisia"" introduces various Spanish instruments and tonalities, culminating in a fantastic interlude at the 0:42 mark. It's a very entertaining depiction. ""Egyptian Descent"" further focuses on regional elements — this time Arabian instruments and vocals — but includes the hook of the James Bond theme as well. It comes together surprisingly well. A further highlight is ""Restoration"", a more cinematic entry that depicts the antagonist in a stereotypical but exciting way with Russian choir.

1157,/wiki/Aston_Martin_DBS_V12,"The DBS V12 was first seen in the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale, the first film in which Bond was played by Daniel Craig, as a result of a product placement deal with Aston Martin's parent company at the time, Ford. The car would go on to appear in Quantum of Solace (2008), as well as the video-games Blood Stone (2010), 007 Legends (2012) and the DLC Best of Bond Car (2018).
The DBS is equipped with 5935 cc V12 engine with four valves per cylinder. The same engine is also used in the DBR9 and DBRS9 racing cars albeit with extensive modifications. The engine of the DBS produces 510 horsepower (380 kW) at 6500 rpm and 570 N·m (420 lb·ft) of torque @ 5750 rpm with a compression ratio of 10.9:1. The engine also includes an active bypass valve which above 5500 rpm opens and lets more air into the engine resulting in increased performance and propels the car from 0-62 mph in 4.3 seconds and has a maximum speed of 191 mph (307 km/h) and 183 mph (295 km/h) with TOUCHTRONIC 2’ transmission. In 2007, the British motoring show Top Gear sent the DBS around their famous test track and recorded a lap time of 1:23.9; 3.2 seconds faster than its predecessor the Vanquish S, and a second faster than the comparable Bentley Continental Supersports.
Aston Martin uses the same VH (vertical horizontal) structure as with the DB9, which provides strength and rigidity to the whole car. Thanks to the structure, 85% of the weight of the car is kept between the wheelbase, which results in increased handling, responsiveness and feel during tight cornering.
Aston Martin has also developed an Adaptive Damping System, or ADS, which alters the suspension in order for the car to cope with the driver's desires and road/weather conditions. When turned on, the ADS automatically alters the suspension settings to ensure the driver has high levels of control at all times. Apart from the suspension getting stiffer, throttle and braking response is increased and steering is sharpened. The DBS is fitted with Pirelli P-Zero tyres developed especially for the car, along with lightweight, aluminium 20"" wheels. To keep the weight as low as possible, Aston Martin has made extensive use of carbon fibre throughout the whole car. The bonnet, the boot, the front wings and the door opening surrounds are all made of carbon fibre. The carpets are also made by special thin layers made from carbon fibre. The roof and the doors are made of aluminium. The result is a 30 kg (66 lb) weight reduction from a regular DB9. The car is also fitted with a carbon fibre splitter at the front wings to increase handling and a carbon fibre rear diffuser to increase high-speed stability.
The brake discs are carbon ceramic, which shaves a significant 12.5 kg (28 lb) from the unsprung weight. At the front, there are 398 mm (15.7 in) ventilated and drilled brakes with 6-piston alloy monobloc callipers. At the back, there are 360 mm (14.2 in) ventilated and drilled brakes with 4-piston alloy monobloc callipers.
The interior of a DBS is a blend of carbon fibre, alcantara leather, wood, stainless steel and aluminium surfaces. The seats are made from semi-aniline and Alcantara leather and both bear the DBS signature with an optional 2+2 seating configuration. The door panels are carbon fibre and the fascia is, as standard, matrix alloy and iridium silver centre console or, as an optional extra, piano black fascia and centre console. To achieve even greater weight savings, the carpet has a special lightweight weave. The car is started by means of the ""Emotion Control Unit"", which was initially developed especially for the DBS but as of 2008 is available for the DB9 and V8 Vantage as well. The key is made from stainless steel and glass and is inserted into a special hole in the dashboard.
Bang & Olufsen has developed a 1000 watt sound system for the DBS which consists of 13 speakers located in 10 different locations throughout the cabin with an integrated Apple iPod connector.
The Aston Martin DBS V12 was first seen in Casino Royale. In the film, the car only features a spare gun and a defibrillator. The car was later destroyed during Bond's pursuit of Le Chiffre.
Aston Martin delivered two working ‘hero’ cars to the film. As well as the two ‘hero’ cars, Aston Martin had to prepare three former development DB9’s for use as DBS look-a-like stunt cars. Also a white prototype DB9 manual was supplied to the film crew so that the stunt drivers had something to practice with.[1]
Due to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450 mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at Millbrook Proving Grounds and Adam Kirley, the stunt driver who performed the stunt, had to use an air cannon located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding 70 mph (113 km/h), the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records on 5 November 2006 as a new world record.
In its first video game appearance the DBS was used by Bond to capture Mr. White at his estate. Used in the car chase of the opening credits and in a flashback to Casino Royale was used by Bond to save himself from being poisoned. It is damaged (off screen) during Bond's pursuit of Le Chiffre. Finally the last flashback was when Bond used it to track down Mr. White.
The DBS appeared in the video game, Blood Stone along with the DB5. Bond uses it to stop a suicide bomber from exploding at the Acropolis. It was used when Bond and Nicole purse Pomerov's train. Finally it was used when Bond chases Nicole.
The DBS made it's third video game appearance in 007 Legends. It is first seen in the Goldfinger mission when Bond tries to use it to escape Goldfinger's headquarters only for him to be held at gunpoint in the car by Mr. Ling. He manages to get rid of Mr. Ling by ejecting his seat and sending him flying out of the car. It appeared at the end of the On Her Majesty's Secret Service mission with Bond and Tracy driving it before she is killed. It appeared again in the Die Another Day mission driven by Bond and Jinx in the chase with Zao and pursing Gustav Graves' plane. 
The DBS also appears in the James Bond's DLC of Forza Horizon 4 : Best of Bond Car.

He previously starred alongside Connery in the WWII film A Bridge Too Far.
Fox is generally associated with portraying the role of the upper-class Englishman, such as the title character in the film The Day of the Jackal (1973) and King Edward VIII in the serial Edward & Mrs. Simpson (1978).
He also portrayed Sgt. Miller in the 1978 film Force Ten From Navarone. The character of Miller had been previously portrayed by David Niven in the original film The Guns Of Navarone. Force Ten was directed by Bond veteran director Guy Hamilton and starred other Bond alumni such as Robert Shaw, Barbara Bach and Richard Kiel.
"
1159,/wiki/DB5,"The iconic Aston Martin DB5, released in 1963, is a luxury grand tourer made by British luxury sports cars manufacturer Aston Martin. It was a slight upgrade from the DB4 which preceded it.
The DB5 is most famous for being the third, but most recognized, James Bond car. The vehicle first appeared in EON Productions' 1964 film Goldfinger and went on to appear in Thunderball (1965), GoldenEye (1995), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), Casino Royale (2006), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015) and No Time To Die (2021). In addition, the vehicle has appeared in the video-games 007 Racing (2000), Agent Under Fire (2001), From Russia with Love (2005), Blood Stone (2010), James Bond: World of Espionage (2015) and the Best of Bond DLC for Forza Horizon 4 (2018).
The vehicle was used again in the following film, Thunderball (Reg: BMT 216A), where it was equipped with two rear-facing water cannons for Bond's escape from Bouvar's château. The effect was achieved using two fire hoses mounted under the vehicle, the hose pipes clearly visible in some shots.
After a thirty-year absence from the film series, the Aston Martin DB5 reappeared in 1995's GoldenEye. Sporting a new number-plate (Reg: BMT 214A), the car was fitted with a radio that doubled as a printer and communication device, and a champagne cooler concealed under the centre arm rest. During the film, Bond is accompanied to Monte Carlo by an MI6 psychiatric evaluator, and engages in a race against a Ferrari F355 GTS owned by assassin, Xenia Onatopp. Three different DB5s were used for filming. The BMT 214A also returned in Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), and was set to make a cameo at Castle Thane in The World Is Not Enough (1999). Although the scene was cut, the outline of the Aston Martin can still be seen in the closing scenes of the film; as M and her staff attempt to locate Bond with a thermal-imaging satellite.
The Aston Martin DB5 (Reg: BMT 216A) appears briefly in Eclipse Comics' 1989 graphic novel, Permission to Die, as Bond's personal automobile that he drives to work in London.
The DB5 made a prominent appearance in the premiere episode (""The Beginning"") of the 1991–92 spin-off animated television series, James Bond Jr., as well as its literary and comic adaptations. Borrowed by Bond's nephew, the vehicle is pursued by agents of the criminal organization, SCUM, who want to procure its electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generator. In reality, the vehicle is not equipped with one. This iteration of the car is equipped with a homing device and remote starter kit. Its most notable feature is its flight mode, whereby its doors fold into wings and a propeller emerges from the radiator grille. The car is destroyed after the SCUM plane it was being carried on crashes in the English countryside. It is implied that Bond Jr's sports car was constructed from the DB5's wreckage.
Playing up to its association with 007, the DB5 also made cameo appearances in media outside the James Bond franchise. It appeared in the 1981 comedy film The Cannonball Run, driven by Roger Moore's character. Two years later, in the TV-film The Return of the Man from UNCLE, George Lazenby, playing a Bond-like character referred to as ""JB"", also drove a gadget-laden DB5 (with the licence plate ""JB""). Another spy show with the homage to Casino Royale called Mission Impossible (1966) in Episode 6 “Odds on Evil” were Steven Hill drives a red Aston Martin DB5 complete with twin yellow flags. Consequently, Timothy Dalton remains the only official Bond actor who has never driven one on screen. However, scripts for his unmade third Bond film show a DB5 was planned to be used.
The most recent appearance of the vehicle was in the 2004 film, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers in which Geoffrey Rush, playing Peter Sellers, is shown driving one at the time of making Casino Royale, even though in real life that film did not feature the vehicle. The car further made a appearance in the popular sandbox game GTA 5 (Grand Theft Auto 5) under the name 'JB700'. It in a mission of the story mode had spikes and a ejecting chair, as well as visible guns on the hood. The car can be bought from Legendary Motor Sports in both the online and story modes. But to many people's dismay, the car does not have the many gadgets of story or the one featured in the movies. Although they all are visible. In a later update to Grand Theft Auto Online, another variant of the car, named JB700W, was added, with the capability to have functional machine guns and a choice between spike and oil slick mines installed, though the ejector seat remains nonfunctional.

She is last seen in the Octopus base, where she is killed by James Bond while trying to escape the facility in an airplane.
Although her presence in the game is virtually non-existent, as she is only once fought or even encountered in gameplay outside of cutscenes, she is available in From Russia With Love's Multiplayer mode for 40,000 skill points.
This makes her one of the most expensive characters in the game along with Auric Goldfinger and Dr. Julius No, who also cost 40,000. Her character description simply states that she is an OCTOPUS agent working with Red Grant to take down Bond.
Eva reappears in a mini-boss fight in the final level of the game ""Octopus Base"" she is very easy and can be beaten simply by flying side to side in the given jetpack and firing missiles at the plane she is in. defeating her will trigger a cutscene in which the burning plane flies into the hangar wall and explodes.

Gregory Lamb was raised in Manchester, the son of a South African father and a British mother. At some point he had travelled to South Africa with his parents and decided he preferred it to life in England. Lamb joined the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6) and requested to be assigned to South Africa after training at Fort Monckton, the secret service training base just outside Gosport, Hampshire. There he worked for ""Station Z"", spending most of his time in the Western Cape but travelling frequently around Africa, attending to his NOC – nonofficial cover –  operations. His cover in Cape Town was that of a successful businessman involved in cargo shipping. Lamb's odd behaviour, largely stemming from the fact that he was essentially a coward, earned him a negative reputation in the service; with Six apparently intending to hand him a redundancy package.

After kissing Bond, the hostess produces a pistol and holds the spy at gunpoint. The pilot emerges from the cockpit and takes the gun from her, handing her a parachute which she puts on. After the pilot shoots out the aircraft's controls, 007 kicks the weapon from his hand and the two brawl until the assassin ends up being knocked out of the plane - shortly followed by a parachute-less Bond. The hostess' fate is unknown.

The character appeared in the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun and was portrayed by Swedish actress Maud Adams. Andrea also appeared in the James Bond 007 tabletop role-playing game.
At the start of the film, Andrea is seen with Francisco Scaramanga, a famous assassin, on his private island in Red Chinese waters, first helping him dry off after a swim and then sunbathes with him. After the pre-title sequence, the plot for the story becomes clear: James Bond has been sent a note from Scaramanga, with a golden bullet engraved with '007'. As the plot unfolds it becomes clear that Miss Anders sent the note and the bullet hoping Bond would come and eventually kill Scaramanga. She considers Scaramanga a ""monster"" but she cannot just leave him because, according to her, people just don't walk out on him as he would kill her or have her killed.
After watching the mysterious Miss Anders collect a shipment of Scaramanga's custom-made gold bullets from a casino in Macau, Bond follows her back to her hotel in Hong Kong and walks in on her as she showers. Startled, she opens the shower door and points a Beretta at him (Bond quips 'a water pistol?'). Demanding a bathrobe she escorts him out of the bathroom at gunpoint. 
As she makes a call to the reception desk, Bond lifts and opens the cigarette packet containing Lazar's bullets. Unnerved, she orders him to give them to her. He obliges and as he passes her the packet, he knocks the weapon from her hand and pins her to the bed. Bond proceeds to interrogate Andrea about her connection with Scaramanaga, threatening first to break her arm if she refuses and then slapping her when she proves uncooperative. She eventually reveals that she is his mistress and divulges his location for that evening; the Bottoms Up Club.
Later that evening, after assassinating British scientist named Gibson, Scaramanga returns to his Junk moored in Hong Kong harbour. Andrea is in bed awaiting him looking uncomfortable. Drawing the golden gun from his jacket pocket, he sensuously caresses her arm and lips with the weapon, eliciting a fearful and repulsed response from the girl.
Later, while romancing fellow agent Mary Goodnight, Bond is visited by Andrea in his hotel room, where she says that she wants Scaramanga dead and she says that Bond can have anything that he wants as long as he kills him. Bond considers the solex agitator, and the young woman says that he can have it and her as well (saying she is not unattractive). She then changes into a light blue bathrobe which Bond admits is charming, and Anders turns off the light. Bond and Andrea kiss and 007 says that sending the bullet to MI6 was an inspiration. He then opens up her bathrobe, and drops it. It falls to the floor leaving her completely naked and the two of them engage in sex.
That night, Andrea goes back to Scaramanga on his junk, on the pretence she has been to the cinema. Scaramanga demandingly asks where she has been, to which she replies 'it was a double feature' (still claiming she was at the cinema). As she puts away her jewellery in Scaramanga's safe, she sees the solex agitator and thinks of Bond. Suspecting she is up to something, Scaramanga enquires what she is doing, and his reply is 'I'm just putting my jewellery away'.
The next morning, Bond meets Miss Anders at a Thai kick boxing match to pick up the solex, but upon arriving and finding that she is not replying, Bond finds that she has already been shot and killed after Scaramanga discovers her deceit. Scaramanga had shot her in such a manner that the bullet struck her heart but the entry wound was partially concealed by her jacket. Obviously searching for the solex after her murder, Scaramanga fails although Bond notices once Scaramanga comes and sits next to him that the solex had fallen out of her purse onto the floor, and Bond carefully guides it with his foot as Scaramanga says of Anders: ""Forget the girl, she is replaceable"".
In the end, Andrea got her wish when Bond gunned Scaramanga down during a duel on his island.
Though having loved Scaramaga, Andrea became fearful of him and loathed his trigger-happy enjoyment of killing. She was willing to do whatever it took to rid herself of this ""monster"" forever even if it meant deceiving others, which is why she set up Bond to kill Scaramanga in the first place, as in her opinion, simply leaving her former lover would only make her his next target. However after feeling guilty for setting Bond up, she willing agreed to help in his mission if it meant he would kill Scaramanga for her.

1168,/wiki/Denise_(Aleta_Morrison),"Second-in-command of the Pussy Galore's Flying CircusDenise is a fictional high-ranking member of Pussy Galore's Flying Circus, a female aviator team led by Pussy Galore under the employ of the infamous businessman, Auric Goldfinger. The character appeared in the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger and was portrayed by British actress Aleta Morrison.
Denise and the others members of Pussy Galore's Flying Circus are involved in Auric Goldfinger's ""Operation Grand Slam"" consists to infiltrate Fort Knox, being in charge to dispensing the Delta 9 nerve gas across the aera of the bank in order to kill 60,000 people. So, Goldfinger and his task force (led by Oddjob and Kisch) to smuggle an atomic bomb (created by Mr. Ling) into the vault. Such an action would make the gold radioactive and useless for 58 years, and that the value of Goldfinger's gold will increase many times, thus making Goldfinger the richest man in the world.
Upon the arrival of James Bond (as he was invited to personally witness the preparations of the operation after being captured by Goldfinger), Denise is seen landing her plane before greeting Galore, who assures her and the other pilots that they will get their assignments tomorrow night. She then dismisses them for the day before transporting Bond to Goldfinger's ranch, where the secret agent learns of Goldfinger's plot. With that in mind, Bond seduces Galore into foiling Goldfinger's plan, so she has Denise and the pilots to replace the nerve gas with a harmless one while alerting the U.S. government about Goldfinger's plan. It is unknown what happens to Denise and the other pilots following the deaths of Goldfinger and his men.
In the script, when we first meet her her name is listed as Althea but later on it says Denise. Either this was a mistake or the two were mashed into one.

1169,/wiki/Dent,"John Strangways, a field operative of the British Secret Service, had collected some samples from Crab Key (Dr. No's island) and sent them to Dent to be analyzed. A worried Dent alerted No, and Strangways and his secretary Mary Trueblood were later assassinated by The Three Blind Mice, three others No's enforcers. When James Bond arrives in Jamaica to investigate Strangways' disappearance, he first meets Dent at Queen's Club, where he and Strangways had often played cards with Pleydell Smith and General Potter.
Bond notices that Dent was the only person who had seen Trueblood, and suspectes that he is involved with the assassinations. Later, Bond interviews Dent about a receipt from Dent's practice he found in Strangways' office. He also questionnes him about some samples Strangways had sent to be analyzed and Dent says they were uninteresting and he threw them out. He also tells Bond that they were definitely not from Crab Key.
Suspicious, Bond later tests Quarrel's boat for traces of radiation using the geiger counter he requested earlier. He notices that there are abnormally high levels of radiation where Strangways had loaded the rocks, which signals to Bond that Dent is a liar. At the same time, Dent goes to Crab Key during the day when ordered never to, just to warn Dr. No about Bond discovering the samples. Dr. No soon informs him that if Bond reaches the island he would be held responsible. He is given a tarantula to murder Bond. During the night, Bond is awoken by the spider and narrowly escapes death by killing the spider with one of his shoes.
The next day, Miss Taro, who is also working for Dr. No, invites Bond to her house to lure him into a trap. He is chased by The Three Blind Mice but manages to escape, killing them and arriving at his destination. A surprised Taro answers the door and when she receives a call from Dent, she tells him that Bond is with her. Dent tells her to keep him there so he could come along later and kill him. Bond suggests going out for dinner and calls for a cab. However, he has actually called Government House and Taro is arrested.
Bond waits for Dent, putting some pillows under the sheets of the bed to make it look like he is sleeping. Dent opens the door and shoots the decoy. However, he turns around and sees Bond in a chair with his weapon with a silencer on it aimed at Dent. Dent tells him that Dr. No is behind the whole master plan and while Dent's gun is on the floor, he uses his leg to get it. He uses the gun and fires the trigger, but realizes too late that he used all of his bullets. Bond casually remarks ""That's a Smith and Wesson. And you've had your six.""
Bond coldly shoots him. As he lies on the floor, he shoots him again, killing him.
Dent's death scene was controversial because it showed James Bond killing a man in cold blood. Even though Ian Fleming had conceived the character as one who is authorized to commit such actions, in none of his novels is Bond shown acting in this manner. According to James Bond: The Legacy, the filmmakers needed a scene to illustrate the ""licensed to kill"" concept and in fact had originally filmed the scene to show Bond firing several more bullets into Dent (more directly illustrating Bond's ""you've had your six"" remark), but ultimately removed all but the first two shots. Some televised broadcasts remove Bond's second shot.

1170,/wiki/Briefcase_Sentry_Gun,"A briefcase turret is a portable sentry gun concealed in a briefcase. Once set-up, the turret automatically aims and fires at targets that are detected by its sensors. Several briefcase sentries were featured in the James Bond video game series, starting with 2002's Nightfire and later with 2005's From Russia with Love.
The first appearance of a briefcase turret was in the 2002 video game Nightfire. Manufactured by Phoenix International as the ""Ronin"", the briefcase hides a minigun which opens fire on anyone other than the individual who set it up. The weapon is sometimes used by enemy NPCs during single-player missions to guard hallways or rooms. It is available to the player during multiplayer, and although it isn't mobile, the Ronin can be controlled remotely by the player that set it up.
Electronic Arts' 2005 adaption of the classic 1963 film From Russia with Love featured deployable briefcase turrets provided by Q Branch. With its red interior, the weapon resembles the attaché case from the novel and film. Unlike its Nightfire equivalent, the turrets are only available to James Bond and are not remotely controllable.

1172,/wiki/Charles_Robinson,"Charles Robinson is a fictional MI6 aide and Deputy Chief of Staff who appears in the James Bond films Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Die Another Day (2002). He was portrayed by British actor Colin Salmon.
Robinson fulfilled much the same role as Bill Tanner, bringing Bond up to speed on the latest events and the parameters of his mission.
Robinson serves as the intermediary between Bond, the command center (headed by M and Admiral Roebuck) and the support ship HMS Chester as the latter infiltrated a terrorist arms bazaar on the Russian border, part of a joint operation between that country and the United Kingdom. Bond's mission was simply to perform reconnaissance before the Chester launched a cruise missile that would kill ""half the world's terrorists,"" according to Admiral Roebuck.
However, upon the agent's discovery of a pair of SB5 nuclear torpedoes affixed to one of the aircraft being sold at the bazaar, a shocked Roebuck immediately phoned the Chester and ordered them to abort the missile. It was out of range and Bond, hearing this from Robinson, sprang into action to steal the jet and managed to evacuate the torpedoes moments before impact. The command center initially believed, due to the destruction of their cameras in the area by the blast, that he had been unsuccessful. Bond then radioed the center and asked where the admiral would like the armaments delivered.
A short time later after Bond had returned to England, Robinson accompanied him, Moneypenny, and M as the agent was briefed on his next mission: to investigate the actions of media mogul Elliot Carver and his relation to the sinking of the HMS Devonshire, a ship that had been seemingly sunk by Chinese MIGs during a confrontation. As a result of the escalating tensions between England and China from this incident, which in reality had been engineered by Carver utilizing a stealth ship, the two countries seemed prepared to go to war. As Robinson and M observed the fleets of the two countries nearing one another in the South China Sea, Carver's plot was exposed.
Robinson is seen here and there but mainly visible near the end of the film when he, R (who has just become the new Q) and M all notice via satellite footage that Bond is having a rather erotic encounter in a hotel with Christmas Jones.
Robinson appears at the beginning during a realistic training simulation that Bond is participating in and later reappears near the end of the film while working with the NSA and M to help diffuse the growing threats by the main antagonists. Upon the arrival of Bond and Jinx, informs that the North Korean hardliners staged a coup and are preparing to invade South Korea under the leadership of Graves [Colonel Tan-Sun Moon].
Initially Charles Robinson was intended as a replacement for the character of Bill Tanner when Michael Kitchen was unavailable to reprise his role from GoldenEye. However, since his performance in Tomorrow Never Dies, he went on to appear in three consecutive films as a regular. Both characters then appeared in The World Is Not Enough.

1173,/wiki/Greco,"Arms dealerGreco is a fictional international terrorist and arms dealer who planned a suicide attack on the G-20 Summit at the Acropolis structure in Athens. The character appears only in the pre-title sequence of 2010 video-game Blood Stone and is voiced by actor Luis Soto.
The story is set a few years after the events of Quantum of Solace. It starts with Greco, an international terrorist planning a suicide attack on the G-20 Summit at the Acropolis structure in Athens. M sends James Bond to investigate and prevent an attack from occurring. After a brief encounter with Greco on his yacht, Bond pursues him through Athens by boat and then on foot. After a second confrontation with Greco which ends with Greco left alive, Bond stops a bomb-laden car destined for the Acropolis structure by knocking it off the road with an Aston Martin DBS V12 he had commandeered, saving the G-20 summit from potential disaster. Greco's fate is left unclear; leaving him potentially the only villain who escapes or ends up in the hands of the authorities.
In the Nintendo DS version of Blood Stone, Greco is able to outrun Bond and get into a truck loaded with explosives, intending to drive it into the Acropolis to carry out the suicide attack personally.  With no transportation immediately available to pursue Greco's truck, Bond then takes a rocket launcher from a nearby goon and uses it to destroy the truck before it reaches its intended target, killing Greco.

1174,/wiki/Beirut,"Beirut is the capital of the Lebanon, and is located in the Beirut Governorate, directly on the Mediterranean coast. It has over two million inhabitants. As one of the oldest cities in the world, Beirut was first mentioned in the 15 century BC.
James Bond shortly visits Beirut in The Man with the Golden Gun, but no scenes were actually filmed there.

Although the exact location within Beirut remains unknown, this nightclub is the only Beirut location visible in the movie. The club was a set built at Pinewood Studios. Bond visits the club, because agent 002 (Bill Fairbanks) had been killed by Scaramanga there in 1969.

1175,/wiki/Dominique_Paradis,"Dominique Paradis was a fictional French Intelligence agent and ally to James Bond in the 2002 video-game 007: Nightfire. The main Bond girl of the game, the player encounters her early in the game as she attempts to track down a missing nuclear warhead. She is voiced by actress Lena Reno.
Dominique and Bond first meet during ""Paris Prelude"", the opening mission of 007: Nightfire (console edition). Bond is assigned to protect the operative as she attempts to prevent an act of terrorism in Paris on New Year's Eve. Moments from being overwhelmed by enemies, Bond rescues her and continues the pursuit in his Vanquish. After preventing the terrorists from destroying the Eiffel Tower, the pair celebrate the new year together over a glass of champagne.
Following the Paris incident, Dominique is assigned to track down a missing nuclear warhead. She discovers that the trail of evidence leads to supposed green industrialist Rafael Drake and goes undercover to find out more. Consequently, she seduces Drake and becomes his mistress. This allows Dominique attends a party hosted at his Austrian castle. Acting as Bond's contact, she meets him in the library and the pair share an intimate moment before being interrupted by CIA agent Zoe Nightshade.
Noting that Drake's associate Alexander Mayhew has arrived with a stolen missile guidance module, they conclude an exchange is immanent. Dominique suggests that the meeting will probably occur in the nearby conference room and quickly heads back to the party before Drake can suspect anything.
Their paths cross again at the Phoenix Building in Tokyo, as Bond infiltrates the villain's headquarters under the cover of darkness. As she arrives at the building by helicopter, she notices Bond scaling the building's exterior and intercepts him in the stairwell. Confirming that Bond has walked into a trap, she helps him escape; suggesting that he take the stairwell to the rooftop and parachute to safety. The pair embrace, unaware that they have been caught on a surveillance camera.
They meet for a final time after Bond is drugged and transported back to the Phoenix Building by Kiko Hayashi. Kiko and two thugs escort Bond to Drake, who is dining with Dominique on the rooftop helipad. After announcing that he is aware of Dominique's betrayal, Kiko is ordered to throw her over the side of the building. Dominique attempts to defend herself and provides a successful distraction for Bond's escape, showing an impressive talent in martial arts. However, Kiko easily defeats her and suddenly kicks Dominique squarely in the gut, knocking Dominique off the side of the helipad to her death, seventy floors below to the lobby floor. Bond survives and gets out of the building by being picked up by Alura McCall in a red getaway car, but was left distraught about Dominique's death, explaining that he ""lost a friend"".
In the level Countdown, Bond avenges Dominique by confronting Kiko at Drake's launching silo where she is killed by incineration from the spacecraft's engines.

1177,/wiki/Dr._Kananga/Mr._Big,"PoliticianDr. Kananga, also known as Mr. Big, was the main antagonist in the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die and was portrayed by American actor Yaphet Kotto.
Drug baron and dictator of a fictitious Caribbean island named San Monique, Kananga is loosely based on the main villain of Ian Fleming's second James Bond novel, Live and Let Die. Like his novel counterpart, Kananga adopts the alias ""Mr. Big"" to conduct his illicit activities, however the difference of novel and film versions of the character are radically different to the point of being completely different people.
Dr. Kananga, operating under the alias ""Mr. Big"", is a businessman and owner of a chain of restaurants in New York City and New Orleans called ""Fillet of Soul"". As Big, he is also the head of one of the most vicious street gangs in Harlem. Kananga is the de facto dictator of the fictional Caribbean island of San Monique and thus has certain diplomatic immunities in the United States easily allowing him to smuggle drugs into the country.
Kananga grows vast quantities of opium in San Monique's poppy fields under the protection of large camouflage nets and guarded by the mystical Baron Samedi. Using the poppies, Kananga hopes to flood the U.S. market with two tonnes of heroin distributed through his legitimate restaurants free of charge, thus forcing other drug dealers out of business. In doing so, he believes that he would double the amount of addicts, which he would be able to exploit with his newfound monopoly.
Kananga attracts the attention of the Secret Intelligence Service when three British agents are killed in the space of twenty-four hours while investigating his business. One agent (Dawes) is killed during a UN meeting at which Kananga and Solitaire are present, another (Hamilton) in New Orleans by the brass band and the last (Baines) is murdered by Dambala, a member of Kananga's voodoo cult on San Monique.
MI6 assigns one of its best agents, James Bond, to investigate the tyrant and his connection with the murders. The agent 007 travels to New York, where Kananga is supposed to arrive later, at the San Monique embassy. However, the villain is warned about Bond's arrival and intentions by the medium Solitaire. To get rid of Bond, he sends his minion Whisper, who shoots Charlie, the driver of Bond's car while on the Rockfeller Expressway. Charlie, now dead from a poison dart, slumps over in his seat and his foot puts its full weight on the gas, causing the car to accelerate rapidly and possibly careen off the expressway. However, Bond grabs the wheel and pulls the emergency brake.
Kananga, who has left the UN and returned to the embassy, knows that he is being watched and that his office is most likely bugged. To deceive the CIA, he starts playing a pre-recorded tape in which he dictates a long, nationalistic letter. He and his associates (Solitaire, Tee Hee and Whisper) then change clothes and leave the embassy through a hidden exit in his office. Thinking that Kananga is still in his office, Felix Leiter calls his friend Bond and tells him to go after Whisper instead. Local police found that the car Whisper was driving when murdering Charlie was registered to the O. Cult Voodoo Shop. Following Whisper in a parking garage, Bond is disturbed by the arrival of Kananga and his henchmen, who enter a car and leave, pursued by Bond.
Bond follows the car in a cab, unaware that Kananga's spies inform their boss about Bond's every move. Arriving at Harlem, Bond sees Kananga's car before the Fillet of Soul restaurant and enters. The taxi driver, also a spy of Kananga, informs his boss that Bond is coming.
In the restaurant, Bond is seated at a table at the wall. While waiting for his drink, Bond tries to bribe the waiter for information but the wall and the table spin, bringing Bond into a secret room. There, three armed henchmen await him, telling him that Mr. Big will ""take care"" of him soon. Bond briefly talks to Solitaire, before Tee Hee arrives and asks the medium whether Bond is armed. Solitaire looks into the cards and confirms this, and Tee Hee disarms Bond with the metal claw he has as his right hand; he uses his artificial appendage to flatten the barrel of Bond's gun.
007 is then brought before their leader. Mr. Big asks Solitaire whether Bond is the one who tailed them from uptown. Bond tries to introduce himself but Big only looks at him briefly and then tells his men to bring Bond outside and kill him. He then leaves the room.
Two of Kananga's henchmen then bring Bond in an abandoned sidealley, where the British agent quickly takes them out. Another black man then arrives, holding his gun at Bond, but the man turns out to be a CIA agent named Harold Strutter. Both men, together with Felix Leiter (who is communicating via a radio in Strutter's car), then wonder how Kananga and Mr. Big fit together. Telling the agents that Kananga is about to leave the USA and return to San Monique, Leiter sends Bond after him.
Knowing that Bond has arrived at San Monique, Kananga sends Whisper, a poisoned snake, and CIA double agent Rosie Carver after Bond, who kills the snake by igniting his deoderant with his cigar and burning it. Due to a warning sent by Solitaire, Bond realises that Rosie is false and he is also able to kill the snake. The next day, Bond and Rosie set out to travel to the point where Baines was killed. Again, Kananga is warned by Solitaire, who he has confined to a isolated palace, about Bond's arrival on the island. He then asks Solitaire about the future. When she draws the card ""The Lovers"", a card Bond drew on their earlier meeting, Solitaire pauses for a moment. Kananga realises this and asks her whether the card meant death. Solitaire goes with the lie and confirms this. Kananga then calls his henchmen, telling them to prepare and that Rosie knows what to do.
Eventually confronting Rosie, Bond reveals that he knows she works for Kananga. Holding her at gunpoint, he tries to force her to give up information. However, when Rosie sees a voodoo totem, she is deeply afraid although Bond believes it to be an act. Rather risking Bond than Kananga, Rosie tries to run off. However, she is shot by a gun hidden inside the mouth of one of the totems on Kananga's orders. After Rosie's death, Kananga travels to Solitaire's palace to find out what went wrong. Telling her that the trap was set and that she saw death, he asks her how Bond could survive. Solitaire tells him that the death she saw must have been Rosie's and that she cannot be held responsible for Kananga's misinterpretations if he fails to ask specific questions. Kananga tells her that her growing impertinence disturbs him. He reminds her what happened to her mother when she lost her power and became useless. He then asks where Bond is now, but Solitaire can't answer him. She tells him that she cannot see when he treats her like that, as thing become unclear. He confines her to her chambers, telling her that she made him angry and he does not want to be. After Solitaire is gone, he talks to Tee Hee.
At the night, Bond infiltrates Solitaire's palace and seduces her. By sleeping with her, she loses her power and becomes useless for Kananga.
When Solitaire is about to bring Bond to Kananga's heroin field, which is protected by large camouflage nets, Kananga is warned. He tells his men to kill Bond if he finds the field, but Bond is able to escape all pursuers. Now aware that Kananga is smuggling heroin, Bond travells to New Orleans because Hamilton was killed there. However, while in a taxi, they are kidnapped by the driver, who is the same one as in New York. He brings them to an airfield, telling them that Mr. Big wants to see him because he stole something from a friend of Big. However, Bond is able to defeat Kananga's men and returns to Felix Leiter. Solitaire, however, is left behind, and returns to possession of Kananga.
In New Orleans, Leiter and Bond enter the Fillet of Souls, unaware that Strutter (they were supposed to meet there) had been killed by the same assassin that killed Hamilton. Remembering his last adventure in the Harlem restaurant of the Fillet of Soul chain, Bond decides against a table at the wall, instead choosing one in the middle of the room, right up at the front of the stage. Felix is then called away by the restaurant's maître d′, under the pretext of a phone call from Strutter, and Bond, along with the table and chairs, is lowered into the ground, having once again become a victim of Kananga's trap doors.
Bond lands in a room in which he is greeted by Tee Hee, Mr. Big and Solitaire, and finds himself secured to a chair by Tee Hee. Big tells him that by taking Solitaire with him, Bond stole something extremely valuable from his ""good friend"" Kananga. Big then tells Bond that while he has plans with Bond, there is, firstly, a question he needs to answer for Kananga. Bond replies that, for the question to be answered, Big had to ship him back to San Monique, as Bond wouldn't answer to lackeys. Though Big angrily asks Bond whether he touched Solitaire, Bond states that he will answer this question only to Kananga, intending to buy time.
However, Big rips his own face off, revealing that it was only a latex mask, and that he himself is Kananga. This causes Bond to seemingly finally realise Kananga's plan: Kananga grows heroin on San Monique and sells it as Mr. Big, thereby making the full profit. However, Kananga laughs, telling him that he wouldn't sell heroin for money. Bond remarks sarcastically that Kananga surely would just give it away, but Kananga confirms that this is exactly what he is intending: a underworld version of ""dumping"" (undercutting prices). He agrees that Bond was correct about Fillet of Soul being a front business and the distribution points for his heroin racket; ""anyone is welcome, black or white, male or female"". By distributing two tons of free heroin, he plans to drive every major drug dealer in the United States (particularly the crime families) out of business, and likely doubling, if not trebling or more, the amount of addicts. By driving up the price of the heroin after securing this monopoly, he intends to make a fortune. Kananga snidely adds that after the plan is done to fruition: ""the only monopolies in America will be me and the post office!""
After having revealed his plan, he comes back to his initial question, whether Bond slept with Solitaire. When Bond refuses to answer out of gentlemanliness, Kananga intends to find out another way. He has Tee Hee take off Bond's watch, which Tee Hee then brings to Kananga. Bond thinks to himself how Kananga could have found out about the watch's abilities from Q Branch. Kananga then tells Tee Hee to snip off the little finger on Bond's right hand on Solitaire's first wrong answer, proceeding to ""more vital organs"" with every subsequent wrong answer. However, Kananga has no knowledge that this watch was invented by Q, simply seeing it as an ordinary man's wristwatch. He then reads a registration number off the back of Bond's watch and asks Solitaire whether he spoke the truth. Solitaire, only able to guess, tells Kananga that he spoke the truth, and Kananga tells Tee Hee to let Bond go, letting him out of the restraint chair, even giving him back his watch. However, as soon as Bond puts his watch back on, Tee Hee knocks him out with his metal arm. Whisper, on cue, arrives in the room and is told by Kananga to take Bond to ""the farm"".
After Whisper and Bond are gone, Samedi, wearing more modern-styled clothes, enters the room. Solitaire then asks Kananga when they will go back to San Monique. Kananga tells her that they will go back soon, but then asks Solitaire why she betrayed him, revealing that the number he read was wrong, and he even gave her a fifty-fifty chance. He wants to know why she betrayed him although he gave her everything and she lacked for nothing. She tells him that the cards foresaw it. He angrily smacks her to the ground, telling her that in proper time he would have given her love and that she knew that. He says that there is only one appropriate way to deal with this betrayal, to which Samedi draws the tarot card 'Death'. Building on this, he says there is one proper time for administering this; on cue, Samedi draws the card marked 'Midnight'
He later intends for Solitaire to be executed by Baron Samedi in voodoo fashion on San Monique, mirroring the fate that befell Baines. Solitaire is tied to two posts by her wrists, and Dambala picks a snake from a coffin filled with snakes with which to kill her. The ceremony atendees summon Baron Samedi from one of the graves in the cemetery, and he gives the order for Dambala to move in for the kill. However, Bond, who has infiltrated the island with the aid of Quarrel Jr. after seeing the half-burnt tarot cards spelling Solitaire's fate, kills Dambala and another man who tries to attack him, seemingly kills Samedi and saves Solitaire, after blowing up the heroin fields.
By a hidden elevator used by Samedi built into one of the graves in the church cemetery, Bond and Solitaire enter Kananga's underground base, where the two are quickly captured and brought before Kananga, who, despite Bond's intervention, is celebrating his success. Kananga reveals to Bond that they found his wetsuit on the beach, before the destruction of the fields, and were thereby expecting him. He acknowledges that Bond blew up some of his heroin but reveals that there is more then enough left, as Bond has done only minor harm. He then takes Bond's gun, admitting that he is very intrigued by it. He asks Bond what it does and Bond tells him that it is a shark gun that shoots compressed gas pallets.
Kananga laughs and aims the gun at the sofa Whisper is sitting on, causing the covering on the main body to inflate and eventually explode. Kananga is highly amused, calling the weapon ingenious. He then takes one of the gas pallets, but Bond warns him to not meddle with it, as the air inside is already ""foul enough"". Kananga replies that he never thought Bond would be a a bad loser, stating that he expected that Bond would drink with him on the success on his operation. The agent and the traitor are then tied up and attached to a winch normally used to carry the heroin onto a monorail that takes it to the coast for shipment. Bond, expecting that the winch will be lowered into the water beneath, states that surely there must be a more efficient way of drowning someone. Kananga says that they will hardly have the chance to drown. He then cuts Bond on the arm three times, just enough to draw blood. Whisper then starts lowering the winch into the water and opens a underwater gate, through which sharks enter. With the electromagnetic field in his watch, Bond obtains the gas pellet Kananga played with before. Bond also uses his watch to free himself from the ropes. Jumping down onto the ground, he runs towards Kananga. Whisper tries to warn his master, but due to his whispering voice, Kananga cannot hear him. Bond drops Whisper into one of the air tight metal capsules used to keep the heroin dry, locks him inside, and engages Kananga. During their fight, both men fall into the water. Underwater, Bond forces Kananga to swallow the gas pallet after pulling the pin out, causing Kananga to inflate enormously like a giant balloon and rapidly rise to the cave's ceiling before exploding into pieces, in which Bond would quip that Kananga ""always did have an inflated opinion of himself"".
Dr. Kananga and Baron Samedi appear in 2012 in the video game 007 Legends as two of the multiplayer characters.
As a well-known and respected UN politician, Kananga is a charismatic and authoritarian man. He can know the doings of his antagonists thanks to Solitaire, who is never far from him, but his tyrannical authority and considerable influence make her fear him because he treats her almost like a slave, while considering that her psychic power is only there to serve him, and is even ready to withdraw it if the urge takes him. As such, he was horribly jealous when his valued ally had a relationship with Bond and so tried to eliminate them both in a convoluted manner, demonstrating the high value he places on loyalty and his intolerance of betrayal. Kananga is also willing to use any means imaginable to find out what his enemies are hiding from him and does not hesitate to use torture and intimidation to get what he wants, as was the case during his interrogations with Bond. Furthermore, because of his power, the dictator has an implicit tendency to be convinced of his own superiority, to the point of being arrogant and conceited. He is also determined to seize every opportunity that can further his plans and is alert to loopholes in the system which he tends to use to his advantage.
Kananga's status as an ambassador makes him distinguished and careful in his appearance, usually wearing dark, high-collared suits that fit perfectly with a tie and briefcase in the top pocket of his jacket. He always expresses himself in a polite and formal manner even when he is angry, and may display a jovial, childish and somewhat extravagant mood in certain situations.
As a Grosbonnet, the gangster adopts an entirely different appearance, opting for contrasting but still expensive costumes including leather jackets and bandanas around his neck. His language is also radically more casual and he insults his enemies much more easily while unleashing his anger and aggression more often. These two contrasts in the character's personality make it even harder to believe that he is leading a double life and therefore give him a definite advantage over his enemies.
At thirty-three, the actor Yaphet Kotto, who portrayed Kananga, is the youngest actor to play a main antagonist in a Bond film.

1179,/wiki/Blast_From_the_Past,"""Blast from the Past"" is the tenth James Bond short story and the first to be written by Raymond Benson. It was first published in the January 1997 issue of Playboy magazine.
Benson has acknowledged that Playboy cut 1/3 of the story for space reasons.
""Blast from the Past"" is a direct sequel to Fleming's You Only Live Twice and appears to exist outside the timeline of either Benson's or John Gardner's other Bond stories.
Bond receives a message, apparently from James Suzuki, - his son with Kissy Suzuki - asking him to come to New York City on a matter of urgency. When Bond arrives, he finds his son murdered. With the aid of an SIS agent, he learns that James was killed in revenge by Irma Bunt, the onetime companion of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and a woman who Bond assumed had died alongside Blofeld (again in You Only Live Twice).

During the pre-credits sequence, Colonel Toro's soldiers can be seen using two Dodge M37s when chasing after Bond. One of them is equipped with a British L7 General Purpose Machine Gun, hinting a possible former Canadian military background.
The other one, without a machine gun, crashes into a rock formation.
As original Russian military vehicles were not available for the filmmakers, Colonel Feyador's Red Army units can be seen using a strange mixture of western vehicles. Among them is at least one Dodge M37, best visible when Bond rides through Afghanistan and sees the bodies of dead Russian soldiers next to their vehicle.

1181,/wiki/Elvis,"Elvis was the fictional right-hand man of Quantum operative, Dominic Greene. The character was a supporting antagonist in the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace and was portrayed by Swiss actor, Anatole Taubman.
As part of his assignment with Quantum, Elvis is tasked with assisting Greene's mission to secure a resource-rich patch of land in Latin America by funding the overthrow of the Bolivian president in favor for exiled Bolivian General Luiz Medrano.
In the film, Elvis first appears when Bolivian secret agent Camille Montes storms along a dockside in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to confront Greene for trying to have her killed by hitman Edmund Slate. He talks to his mother in Swiss-German on the phone. The bodyguard tries to stop her from entering the area, but she just pushes him aside; for good measure, she later ends up escaping with James Bond, quickly establishing Elvis as somewhat ineffectual (an impression not helped by his ridiculous bowl-cut hairpiece).
Elvis then accompanies Greene in their private jet during a meeting between Gregg Beam and Felix Leiter, this time remaining firmly in the background as his boss and the crooked CIA agent conduct their business. He is later present at the Tosca performance where he stands guard over Greene in his personal box.
Shortly after the confrontation with Greene at the the Greene Planet Fundraiser Party, Elvis is dispatched to stop Bond and Camille from leaving the area, chasing them up a stairwell. However, Bond's MI6 partner Strawberry Fields ""accidentally"" trips Elvis, sending him falling down the stairs and allowing Bond and Montes to escape. To add insult to injury, Elvis is seen wearing a neck brace from then on.
Elvis and Greene's driver are later seen at the Eco Hotel in Bolivia's Atacama Desert, where they watches over Greene's meeting with General Medrano and Colonel Carlos. Though Greene is able to talk Medrano into signing the deal with Quantum, the meeting is interrupted when Bond arrives on the scene, killing Carlos and sparking a fire inside the hotel, forcing Greene to evacuate the area as Bond fights off the remainder of Medrano's soldiers. Per Greene's instructions, Elvis is ordered to stay behind and cover his employer's escape, keeping his gun trained at the door in readiness for Bond. Unfortunately for him, the fire sparked by Bond's arrival in the building reaches one of the hotel's hydrogen fuel cells at this point, causing a massive explosion that engulfs the room and much of the hotel, incinerating Elvis on the spot.

She took the information to Bond, who snapped at her for disobeying his wish to be left alone. Minty was overwhelmed by his harshness, and shrank away, weakly defending her decision, as she only meant to deliver important information. Realizing his error, he thanked her and urged her not to cry.
After weeks away in Zanzarim, Bond called Minty to give her a fake address and to say he was fishing in Scotland while he went solo in the America for a mission of revenge.

Whilst M, Q and Miss Moneypenny are enjoying the horse racing at Royal Ascot, James Bond is introduced to Sir Godfrey Tibbett. He puzzlingly tells him that he has never seen a horse perform so well in the late stages of the race, suspecting foul play by Max Zorin.
Later, Tibbett accompanies Bond to Zorin's Chateau where he poses as Bond's chauffeur, although Tibbett gets more than he bargained for when he is made to carry a multitude of Bond's baggage to his room. Bond then plays a recording of himself haranging Tibbett, suspecting the room is bugged. He and Tibbett go to the veranda to have an actual conversation about Zorin. Tibbett remarks it is quite a bit of work pretending to be a put-upon Man Friday.
As night falls, the pair uncover Zorin's secret underground surgery room and warehouse.
However, when Zorin discovers Bonds true identity, he arranges for him and Tibbett to be killed. Tibbett is the first to go. He is killed by May Day when she grabs him from the back seat and strangles him as the 1962 Rolls Royce drives through the car wash. Back at the track, Bond attempts to flee with Tibbett, only to see May Day wearing Tibbett's driving hat and pointing a pistol at him. Bond is overpowered and forced into the Rolls Royce alongside Tibbett's corpse, where both have an ""underwater funeral"" by being buried in a lake, courtesy of May Day shoving the car into the water. Bond sees that Zorin and his henchmen are standing by the shoreline, prepared to shoot him should he swim back up. Bond saves his life by unscrewing the cap on one of the Rolls Royce's tires, then helping himself to compressed air until Zorin, confident 007 is dead, leaves.
Tibbett have the personality of a seasoned English gentleman, he is very patient to Bond's over the top demands. Sir Godfrey possessed a gentle and friendly personality, which is very much unlike his position in British Intelligence.

After Bond and Dufour are gone, Drax tells Chang to make sure that some harm comes to Bond.
While showing Bond around, Bond and Goodhead arrive at the centrifuge chamber, in which astronauts are trained to endure the gravity force felt when travelling to space.

1189,/wiki/0014,"The 00 Section of MI6 is considered the secret service's elite. A 00 (typically read ""Double O"" and denoted in Fleming's novels by the letters ""OO"" rather than the digits ""00"") is a field agent that holds a licence to kill in the field, at their discretion, to complete any mission. Standard mandatory retirement age is 45 though various writers including Ian Fleming, Sebastian Faulks and John Gardner have contradicted this as a matter of Poetic License and several actors who have portrayed Bond on film have been older than 45 at the time of playing the character. Although Fleming only mentioned five 00 agents, others have been added over the years across various franchise media.
The following list is of the known members of this elite order who have been referenced in officially licenced James Bond fiction: novels, films, video games, and comic strips (not including impostors).

1190,/wiki/Anatol_Gogol,"Ministry of Foreign AffairsDespite the popular assumption about the James Bond series' Cold War focus, Gogol is never depicted as a true villain. At his most hostile, he is a respectful competitor and more often is an ally against the common foes of peace. His first appearance is in The Spy Who Loved Me, where he is seen sending Anya Amasova to recover an important roll of microfilm.
Later in the film, Gogol and James Bond's superior, M, form an alliance, which is the start of the Anglo-Soviet relationship as a result of their mutual pursuit of Karl Stromberg.
Gogol is seen next in Moonraker, talking to USAF Colonel Scott over the telephone about Hugo Drax's space station. He tells the Americans it is not a Soviet station and that they would investigate it themselves after the US had intercepted it. Colonel Scott apologizes for calling Gogol at a bad time due to the time differences, but Gogol says there is nothing to apologize over, as ""problems in Russia keep him awake"", just as he is seen with an attractive Russian woman in a nightgown.
In For Your Eyes Only, Gogol wants to buy an ATAC communicator from Aristotle Kristatos, after the ship carrying it is sunk in an accident. Kristatos recovers the unit and arranges a sale at his private headquarters, but Gogol arrives there just as Bond and his allies are going after Kristatos for the murders he has committed to retrieve the device. When Bond throws it off a cliff, Gogol is initially dismayed but keeps his guard from shooting Bond; as Bond notes that his actions maintain détente, Gogol chuckles as he acknowledges Bond's observation that the machine's destruction allows the nations to remain in their relatively peaceful status quo. The assistant of General Gogol, appearing briefly in For Your Eyes Only, is called Rubelvitch, a wordplay on the name Moneypenny.
In Octopussy, when General Orlov proposes invading the West, Gogol is the loudest voice opposing the reckless plan, asserting both the danger of provoking a nuclear war and that the USSR wants peace, not war. Gogol's investigations of Orlov's scheme to weaken NATO's defence runs parallel to Bond's, but his subordinates' unauthorized fatal shooting of the traitor prevents him from learning the full details of his plot and warning NATO, though Bond is able to stop Orlov's plan on his behalf, and later appears before M to inform him that his government will deny the incident and request that Bond return their treasure Romanov Star that he has in his possession which Orlov previously stole.
In A View to A Kill, Gogol in first seen in France. He reprimands Max Zorin, an erstwhile KGB agent, for killing 007 without the KGB's approval beforehand. Zorin thinks of himself as no longer part of the KGB. Gogol also learns of Operation Main Strike, and demands Zorin stop at once.
When Zorin defies the order to stop his plan, Gogol sends KGB agent Pola Ivanova to see what Zorin is up to. When Pola meets Bond, she tries to take the tape from him and give it to Gogol. Gogol is embarrassed that Pola got the wrong tape.
At the end of the film, Gogol awards Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's plan to destroy Silicon Valley, stating that Bond was the first non-Soviet citizen to receive it and that the KGB has its own heart of operations producing their own technology at Silicon Valley (being awarded this medal contradicts a statement in the novel Goldfinger that stated that people in the British Secret Service could not accept awards from foreign services, no matter how friendly (such as the CIA). However, Bond may not have accepted the award, and the Russians may have insisted he was awarded it anyway, whether he'd accepted the medal or not.)
In The Living Daylights, Gogol is mentioned as having retired from the KGB and his position being succeeded by General Pushkin, He is only seen in the end, as a diplomat in the Foreign Ministry. He attends Kara Milovy's concert with M, offering Milovy a visa which would allow her to leave the Eastern bloc at will.

When Bond seemingly assassinates Colonel Moon, the general has him imprisoned and tortured for more than a year. He eventually releases him in exchange for the release of Zao, who had been captured by the West for terrorism.
Towards the end of the film, tensions escalate between the Koreas and the hardliners stage a coup in North Korea, arresting General Moon. He is later to be accompanied by Gustav Graves as he demonstrated the power of the new Icarus heat-ray in Iceland. On Graves' giant plane, while he and his officers are having a conversation with Graves, Graves tries to convince the him that the General himself is his father by saying the General's personal memorized tactics. Now the General learns that Graves is actually the new identity of his still living son, Colonel Moon, hiding behind a new face thanks to gene therapy.
Graves hoped his demonstration of power to break the Korean Demilitarized Zone in order to invade South Korea would impress his father, but instead Moon realizes that his son is insane and threatens to kill him with one of the officers' Makarov, saying that the plan will instead destroy themselves and his real son died long ago. Graves disarms his father and, stating his disappointment in him, shoots him in the chest, killing him as other officers seeing their comrade getting murdered by his own son. Graves then coldly removed his Order of Freedom and Independence, Korean equivalent of 'Medal of Honor', provoking Bond, enraged at seeing the death of the general who spared his life back in North Korea, to try and kill Graves on the spot.

"
1195,/wiki/General_Koskov,"Lieutenant-General Georgi Koskov (Russian: Георгий Косков) was a fictional deceitful Soviet General who was in league with arms dealer Brad Whitaker. Portrayed by Dutch actor Jeroen Krabbé, the character was one of the two main antagonists (alongside Whitaker) in the 1987 James Bond film The Living Daylights. He later made an appearance in the 2000 video game 007 Racing, voiced by Alistair Abell.
Georgi Koskov is a deceitful, mastermind and sociopathic Soviet general in business for himself, who carefully plays both sides of the Cold War. Initially, Koskov gives the impression of a somewhat anxious pawn in the battle between the Soviet Union and the West, when he is, in reality, a mastermind using all means to his own advantage. He is prepared to dote on his girlfriend Kara Milovy and give her all manner of expensive gifts (the prize among which is a Stradivarius cello), but when necessary will easily sign her death warrant. He is also secretly working with American arms dealer Brad Whitaker in an illicit arms and drug deal.
Koskov fakes his own defection using Kara Milovy as a sniper to make it look real. James Bond is assigned in aiding him across the border into Austria. At a safe house in England, Koskov falsely and deliberately fingers KGB head General Pushkin as the mastermind of ""Smiert Spionem"" or ""Death to Spies,"" a plot to kill off American and British spies, but Bond suspects the truth. After Koskov is recaptured by the KGB following a raid on an MI6 safehouse after his debriefing, MI6 dispatches Bond to terminate Pushkin despite the 00 Agent's doubts.
Bond eventually discovers through his contact with Kara that defection was not Koskov's true intent, and in an attempt to lure him out, conspires with General Pushkin to fake the latter's death. Bond fakes Pushkin's assassination in Tangier just as Necros was ordered to carry out the attack himself and Koskov moves forward with his plans upon this news. He tricks Kara into incapacitating Bond and flies the two of them to Soviet-occupied Afghanistan where the two of them are to be imprisoned. Despite their eventual escape, Koskov was still left to operate freely.
It is later discovered that Koskov is misusing funds from the Soviet Union to purchase a massive supply of opium with a street value of $500 million from the local Mujaheddin drug lords in Afghanistan; he and Whitaker would then distribute the drugs through the United States and reap huge personal profit in the sales, while still buying up plenty of advanced armaments through Whitaker to bolster the Soviet occupation of the country. Intending to disrupt this exchange, Bond trails Koskov back to the airbase, where he is later rescued by his newfound Mujaheddin allies as they attack the Soviet forces. Amidst the confusion, Bond and Kara hijack the aircraft carrying Koskov's newly purchased opium supply, and make their escape despite Koskov and Necros' attempts to stop them.
Ultimately Koskov is captured by Pushkin just as Bond kills Whitaker in Tangier and is returned to his motherland under armed escort. Koskov is arrested and presumably executed off-screen by the Russian government.

He is later present at the Tosca performance where he stands guard over Greene in his personal box.
Shortly after the confrontation with Greene at the the Greene Planet Fundraiser Party, Elvis is dispatched to stop Bond and Camille from leaving the area, chasing them up a stairwell. However, Bond's MI6 partner Strawberry Fields ""accidentally"" trips Elvis, sending him falling down the stairs and allowing Bond and Montes to escape. To add insult to injury, Elvis is seen wearing a neck brace from then on.
Elvis and Greene's driver are later seen at the Eco Hotel in Bolivia's Atacama Desert, where they watches over Greene's meeting with General Medrano and Colonel Carlos. Though Greene is able to talk Medrano into signing the deal with Quantum, the meeting is interrupted when Bond arrives on the scene, killing Carlos and sparking a fire inside the hotel, forcing Greene to evacuate the area as Bond fights off the remainder of Medrano's soldiers. Per Greene's instructions, Elvis is ordered to stay behind and cover his employer's escape, keeping his gun trained at the door in readiness for Bond. Unfortunately for him, the fire sparked by Bond's arrival in the building reaches one of the hotel's hydrogen fuel cells at this point, causing a massive explosion that engulfs the room and much of the hotel, incinerating Elvis on the spot.

The character appeared in the 2010 video-game, James Bond 007: Blood Stone, and was voiced by Timothy Watson.
Dr. Malcolm Tedworth was a lead scientist in a Midhurst Laboratories project to investigate smallpox and anthrax; developing antidotes for the British armed forces, for use in the event of a biological attack. In a bid to extract details of his research which might be weaponized, Tedworth was kidnapped from his yacht in the English Channel by mercenaries in the hire of Russian oligarch, Stefan Pomerov. He was brought to Istanbul, where he was held captive by Bernin in the Byzantine catacombs underneath the city, along with fellow bio-tech researchers 'Remy' and Dr. S. Justacomins, director of bio-engineering at the University of Stuttgart. He is initially presumed dead as a result of a sudden squall capsizing his yacht, however MI6 is tipped off to his presence in Turkey (believing him to be selling his research) and dispatches James Bond to investigate. 007 arrives too late to rescue Tedworth from electric-shock interrogation; under pressure he divulges the password to the encrypted USB drive containing his research and is shot dead by his interlocutors. Bond later uncovers footage of his torture in Pomerov's safe.
In the Nintendo DS version of Blood Stone, instead of whispering out the password to his torturers prior to his execution, Tedworth tearfully says out loud that it was his phone number, twice.

Felony O'Toole was a S.C.U.M. agent operating in Southern California. She was responsible for the theft of the U.S. Galaxy Defence System during transit to its home base and, realizing that nobody in the organisation was capable of programming it, she organised the capture of the world's leading computer expert, Professor Braintrust. Taking advantage of the scientist's love of the popular Spy Man film series, O'Toole replaced the film's lead actor (Neville Geniue) with a disguised subordinate and invited Braintrust to tour the studio. Despite successfully abducting the professor, her scheme was unravelled by the intervention of James Bond Jr., who chased the villains, Genue's kidnapped daughter, and their unwitting scientific abductee around the studio complex.
In a bid to escape from her pursuers, O'Toole persuaded the gullible Braintrust to reprogram an enormous animatronic lizard robot. With James and his friends preoccupied by the robot, the villains fled from the studios with their captives. At the urging of S.C.U.M. Lord, Felony attempted to dispose of Geniue and his meddling daughter by tying them to both to the rocket-attached ""H"" of the famous ""Hollywood"" sign. However, she was ultimately thwarted by the arrival of Bond and his friends in a movie stunt helicopter. As Bond rescued the father and daughter, his companions used the helicopter's electro-magnet attachment to lift O'Toole's speeding car from the road; tossing her and her accomplice out and into nearby water. Her fate is unknown.

1207,/wiki/007:_License_to_Drive,"After testing a new combat simulator (Level 1: Tutorial), James Bond is assigned to investigate a recently formed terrorist group in Beirut City. M instructs him to drive to the terrorists's safe house and make observations (Level 2: Beirut 1). Bond finds that there is no one there and they appear to have left recently. M informs him that MI6 intercepted panicked calls from the group to a handler. The handler was very concerned about an unidentified 'cargo', which the terrorists are moving in three trucks. 007 is subsequently ordered to pursue and destroy them (Level 3: Beirut 2). Due to damage sustained to his car, Bond is provided with a motorcycle for the mission and destroys the vehicles, finishing the last with a rocket-propelled grenade. M then contacts him and sends him to Greece in pursuit of the handler, who is going to transport the cargo on a ship docked in Thessaloniki (Level 4:  Thessaloniki ). 12 hours later, Bond arrives by gadget-equipped speedboat and after fighting off hostile boats reports back to M that the ship is empty. He provides her its registry numbers, which she uses to trace the vessel’s owner –  the arms dealer, Thierry Cogney.
Bond travels to the South of France, where Thierry is attending the Cannes film festival. Knowing Cogney will be returning to his hotel shortly, Bond speeds through the streets in his car, outrunning the local police (Level 5:  Cannes). He enters the hotel and pockets documents, revealing that Cogney is an ex-French foreign legion Colonel who served in the first Indochina War. A businessman, he owns a crab processing plant in Alaska and is suspected to be an arms dealer by US authorities. Travelling to Alaska, 007 is warned by M that Cogney is on to him and has mobilized his henchmen to stop him from reaching the plant (Level 6: Alaska). After discovering that he can't reach the factory by car, Tanner provides Bond with a jet ski to navigate the river to the plant (Level 7: Alaska 2). Reaching the plant, Bond discovers that the warehouse is stuffed with weapons and explosives. In addition, he discovers a number belonging to a student in Munich, Germany. Five helicopters attempt to escape with some of the weapons and Bond is ordered to shoot them down (Level 8: Alaska 3). Successful, 007 heads to Munich and is informed that the student has been flagged for arrest by German authorities. Bond races to get to him before he is moved to US custody - effectively thwarting MI6's investigation (Level 9: Munich). Interrogating the student, 007 extracts two Manila airline tickets.
Travelling to Manilla, 007 is ordered to follow a truck leaving the harbor (Level 10: Manilla 1) and swaps his car for a boat (Level 11: Manilla 2). He reports that the 'cargo' has been moved once again and provides M with a name - La Flour Trinh - which MI6 attempt to track down as 007 escapes the harbor. It turns out that it is the name of a hotel in Ho Chi Minh City. The Indian Prime Minister is staying at the hotel; leading M to surmise that he is the target. The Manila terrorist organization 007 has been battling has ties with the Pakistani ISI, which Cogney is using to perform the attack. The arms dealer stands to make a lot of money from starting a war between Pakistan and India; the entire region will be destabilized and he can traffic weapons to all sides of the fighting. M orders Bond to leave Manilla and head to Vietnam (Level 12: Manilla 3). Once there, M sends 007 the location of the 'cargo', which they have determined is a powerful explosive device. Bond 'borrows' a helicopter and sets off after the bomb (Level 13:  Ho Chi Min City 1); protecting the truck from enemies until he can board it and drive it to safety (Level 14:  Ho Chi Min City 2). The scheme foiled, M sends 007 to apprehend Cogney. However, 007 is already making for his farm with the bomb; aiming to 'force his retirement'. He detonates it, killing the arms dealer.

1209,/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Guermantes,"The Château de Guermantes was the filming location for the interior of the Drax residence in the film Moonraker.  It is a private French château located 2 km from Euro Disneyland.
Construction of the Château de Guermantes in Lagny-sur-Marne, Seine et Marne, France, was undertaken by Claude Viole (died 1638), whose family had possessed the fief of ""Le Chemin"" since the mid sixteenth century. Paulin Pondre (1650-1723) purchased the property in 1698. He engaged Jules Hardouin-Mansart for renovations to the building, completed in 1710 (Ministère de la culture), and André Le Nôtre to lay out the garden. Pondre was receveur des finances at Lyon and had become one of the most powerful financiers of the reign of Louis XIV; he was appointed President of the Cour des Comptes in 1713. Guermantes was the scene of memorable fêtes.
In 1719 the Scottish financier John Law purchased Guermantes for 800,000 livres; he only enjoyed possession for a matter of months before the bubble built on paper money burst and he was forced into exile. Paulin Pondre was able to take possession once more; his family were dispossessed at the Revolution.
Guermantes is built of brick with stone facings and quoins, in an H-plan, with projecting pavilions flanking the corps de logis, under tall sloping slate roofs and tall chimney stacks. The house stands in a large park. The front is now approached in the English manner, with a drive sweeping to the side and an unbroken expanse of lawn. On the garden front, the house stands on a terrace with steps leading down to the former parterre, which is now lawn, and the expanse of water in the formally-shaped pièce d'eau, from the far end of which the château is reflected in its entirety..
The original furnishings of Guermantes have been scattered, but rooms retain their seventeenth- and eighteenth-century boiseries. The family Pondre maintained the property until 1929, by which time Marcel Proust had employed ""Guermantes"" for the family at the top of the French society he was describing. There has never been a duchesse de Guermantes; Proust's ""château de Guermantes"", unreachably beyond the limits of family walks from Combray then purchased by the Verdurins, was based on the duc de Sully's Château de Villebon, Eure-et-Loir.

1211,/wiki/General_Bukharin,"Major General Bukharin is a fictional General of the Russian Armed Forces. A minor character played by late British actor Terence Rigby, he appeared in the 1997 James Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies, and was subsequently adapted for the film's accompanying novelisation, penned by Raymond Benson.
The film begins with James Bond remotely broadcasting footage of a terrorist arms bazaar somewhere on the Russian border. Major General Bukharin is Russia's liaison to the joint MI6 / Admirality team in the British Situation Room. Impatient and satisfied with the intelligence provided by 007, Admiral Roebuck asks Bukharin if his troops are prepared for the kind of firepower presented by the terrorists' defences. With an upcoming election in Moscow, the President of Russia has made it clear to the General that any loss of life is unacceptable. Roebuck opts for a naval solution - ordering a cruise missile strike on the position. However, shortly after ordering the strike it is revealed that one of the terrorist aircraft is equipped with a Soviet SB-5 nuclear torpedo. A visibly nervous Bukharin exclaims that it might not detonate, but there's enough plutonium on-board to make Chernobyl look like a picnic. Unable to abort the missile, Bond is forced to steal the plane - along with its deadly cargo - and narrowly escapes.
"
1212,/wiki/Aki_(Akiko_Wakabayashi),"Aki is a fictional agent of the Japanese Secret Service who appeared in the 1967 James Bond film, You Only Live Twice, portrayed by actress Akiko Wakabayashi.
When the movie got dubbed in Japanese, Aki was voiced by Kazue Komiya and Mayuno Yasokawa in the TBS and DVD/Blu-Ray versions, respectively.
Aki is first seen when 007 meets her at a sumo wrestling show. Bond is there to meet a contact who will take him to Mr. Henderson, M's recommended contact in Japan. He confirms that Aki is his contact by saying the code words ""I love you"" to her. Aki takes Bond to meet Henderson in her Toyota 2000GT. After Henderson is killed during their meeting, Bond attacks and kills one of Henderson's killers. Taking the man's place, he is driven to the Osato Chemical Works HQ, where he is discovered by the villains. Aki rescues him, using her skills as a driver, then takes him to meet her boss, Tiger Tanaka. It is after this that a bikini-clad Aki invites Bond to spend the night with her, famously saying ""I think I will enjoy very much serving under you"", before Bond carries her to bed.
At Tanaka's house, the shapely and scantily-dressed Aki unnoticeably swaps with Bond's masseuse and gives him a kiss. As he carries her away she remarks that nobody will disturb them tonight and that she ""will enjoy serving under him"".
Shortly after Bond's arrival at the ninja academy, an assassin stealthily enters the bedroom where Bond and Aki are sleeping together and lowers a thin cord to Bond's mouth, intending to poison him. At the last moment, Bond turns in his sleep and Aki moves to his position and the poison falls on her lips which she inadvertently swallows. The poison acts quickly, causing Aki great pain; after a few agonized seconds of gasping for breath, she dies.
The original name of the character was Suki. It was changed out of gratitude to actress Akiko Wakabayashi, who had originally been cast as the film's other Bond girl, Kissy Suzuki. It was discovered that Mie Hama, who had originally been cast in the Suki/Aki role spoke poor English and the producers were concerned that she would not be able to cope with the part. They were, however, fearful that if they fired her, she would consider that by being fired she had brought shame on her family, and might commit suicide.
As a result, they built up the role of Suki/Aki, decreased the number of lines Kissy had and asked Wakabayashi if she would agree to switch parts. She agreed, and they renamed the character to thank her. In the finished film, Kissy plays a far smaller part than Aki (and is actually billed after her in the credits), even though she is generally regarded as being the lead Bond girl.
Certainly, Bond builds far more of a relationship with Aki, and may possibly be falling in love with her, as evinced by a scene where Tanaka tells him that when he goes undercover as a Japanese fisherman, the role will require him to have a ""wife."" Bond immediately looks to Aki, and her pleased reaction clearly shows that the idea appeals to both of them (although Tanaka vetoes it, as the ""wife"" - Kissy - needs to be an operative who is a native of the region Bond is staking out).
Indeed, Aki is among the more pro-active female characters from the 1960s Bond films, and her character has some similarities to that of Tracy Bond, who Bond would marry for real in the series' next film On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Both are depicted as intelligent women who can take care of themselves, both save Bond from the villains during the course of the story, and both are excellent drivers, taking the wheel during the films' respective main car chases. Bond's reaction to Aki's death is also stronger than similar characters such as Jill Masterson.

1213,/wiki/Cyanide,"Cyanide is a fast-acting poison that can be lethal and is often used in espionage stories as a method of assassination or suicide. In the James Bond franchise, the poison was first mentioned in Ian Fleming's 1957 novel, From Russia, with Love, and had been utilized many times since in literature, film, and games.
It was first seen in the 1962 James Bond film where a henchman called Jones who is working for SPECTRE operative Dr. No uses it when Bond outmatches him. Bond offers him a cigarette but Unbeknownst to him Jones deliberately trying makes one with a hidden Cyanide capsule and commits suicide by ingesting the substance.
Bond's Attaché case is fitted with this if he has no other option although he takes it and flushes it down a toilet seeing no use for it.
In Thunderball it is revealed that Paula Caplan swallows Cyanide to commit suicide with.
The Police Narcotics agent Kwang is shot and before suffering at the hands of the infamous Drug Lord Franz Sanchez he bites into a Cyanide Capsule and dies.
In Skyfall Bond captures Raoul Silva and takes him to the Mi6 Safehouse to be interrogated. There he Reveals to Bond and M that he was tortured by the Chinese Communists during the Transfer of Sovereignty in 1997 after M sold him to them. After 5 months of Brutal torture and hopelessness Silva still kept a Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN) capsule in his back left Molar. He. Broke the tooth that contained the Capsule then he bit and ingested it. After he did this however the Capsule did not kill him but even worse intenally burned his insides and damaging them as well as dissolving his gums most of his teeth as well as painfully burning away his cheekbone. After he escaped captivity he had to where prosthetic teeth with a false metal Jaw bone and Temporomandibular joint which when is fit into place hides the disfigurement and burns caused by the damage done by the Hydrogen Cyanide.

1214,/wiki/Doctor_No,"Dr. No (sometimes published as Doctor No, primarily in American editions) is the sixth James Bond novel by Ian Fleming, originally published in 1958. The novel was adapted as the first official Bond film in 1962, the success of which would lead to a popular, long, and continuing series of films made by EON Productions.
The novel marks the first time a number of James Bond signature elements are used. It is the first novel in which Bond uses his signature Walther PPK handgun and also the first time Major Boothroyd (also known as Q, the armourer) appears, although Bond's first gadget was in the previous novel, From Russia, with Love.
The plot of the novel and the film are very similar, only differing when elements from the previous novels are referenced, primarily From Russia, with Love and Live and Let Die.
From Russia, with Love ended in a cliffhanger with the status of James Bond unknown. Bond was poisoned by SMERSH agent Rosa Klebb and collapsed at the end of the novel. In Dr. No, M learns from the firm's neurologist that the poison was tetrodotoxin, which is obtained from the sex organs of the Japanese fish fugu. Tetrodotoxin paralyses the muscles of the victim while they stay fully conscious until eventually they die from asphyxiation. Bond is given first aid treatment by his friend, René Mathis, whilst a doctor is summoned. The doctor had spent time in Africa and had dealt with various poisons. He diagnoses curare poisoning and treats Bond accordingly. Even to date, there is no current antidote and the chances of survival are very slim.
Nonetheless, Bond survives. When he returns to duty, he is sent by M on a ""rest cure"" to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of Strangways, the head of station in Kingston, who had previously appeared in Live and Let Die. Bond learns that Strangways had been investigating the activities of Dr. Julius No, a Chinese-German who lives on an island called ""Crab Key"" that is said to be the home of a vicious dragon.
With help of Quarrel (previously in Live and Let Die), as well as the beautiful Honeychile Rider, who visits the island to collect valuable shells, Bond discovers that Dr. No, who ostensibly operates a business harvesting and exporting guano, is in fact working with the Russians. They have supplied him with several million dollars worth of equipment to sabotage nearby American missile tests. Bond and Honeychile are captured by Dr. No, but Quarrel is burned to death by the (mechanical) dragon. Doctor No's speciality is torture and he tortures Bond to discover and record his powers of endurance.
Bond discovers that Dr. No is also working with the Russians and has built an elaborate underground facility from which he can sabotage American missile tests at nearby Cape Canaveral. No had previously been a member of a Chinese Tong, but after he stole a large amount of money from their treasury, he was captured by the organisation, whose leaders had his hands cut off as a sign of punishment for theft, and then ordered him shot. The Tong thought they shot him through the heart.
However, because No's heart was on the right-hand side of his body (as a sufferer of dextrocardia), the bullet missed his heart and he survived. Interested in the ability of the human body to withstand and survive pain, No forces Bond to navigate his way through an obstacle course constructed in the facility's ventilation system. He is kept under regular observation, suffering electric shocks, burns and an encounter with large poisonous spiders along the way. The ordeal ends in a fight against a captive giant squid, which Bond defeats by using improvised and stolen objects made into weapons. After his escape he encounters Honey from her ordeal where she had been pegged out to be eaten by crabs; the crabs ignored her and she had managed to make good her own escape. Bond kills Dr. No by taking over the guano-loading machine at the docks and diverting the guano flow from it to bury the villain alive. Bond and Honey then escape from No's complex in the dragon buggy.
Back in Jamaica, Bond tidies up his official affairs with Pleydell Smith, colonial secretary, arranging to have Honey's surgery to mend her broken nose. He then has a nighttime dinner at the remains of Honey's family estate alone with her.
Dr. No was adapted into comic strip form in 1960.

1220,/wiki/Carver,"Elliot Carver was a fictional British media baron who attempted to provoke a war between the United Kingdom and China in order to destroy the Chinese government and use the new government to obtain exclusive broadcasting rights in China. The character was the main antagonist in the 1997 James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies and was portrayed by British actor Jonathan Pryce. Carver also appeared in Raymond Benson's accompanying novelization as well in his 1999 video game adaptation, voiced by Steve Hope Wynne.
Elliot Carver was born in Hong Kong, officially an orphan. He is the illegitimate son of a German woman who died in childbirth and Lord Roverman, a press tycoon. A Chinese family took the boy for a one-time fee of fifty pounds. Thirty years later, Carver confronted and blackmailed Roverman into suicide and took over his media empire.
Elliot Carver went to college in Hong Kong and received a degree in the communication arts. By his own accounts, he had worked for a local newspaper during his adolescence. During his early adulthood, he was hired as a meteorologist at a Hong Kong Television Station and eventually became the station's anchorman. During this time, he often sexually harassed his female coworkers, to the point that one of them fled Hong Kong to get away from him.
In the years since, Carver fashioned himself as a media magnate, utilizing his background in the press and broadcasting. After striking success in rebranding Roverman's enterprise as his own, Carver took Paris McKenna as his first wife. Before marrying Elliot, Paris Carver was romantically linked to James Bond.
In the present, Carver is a billionaire international media mogul of the German-based mass media company, the Carver Media Group Network. He frequently uses his influence to gain advantage for his firm or wreak havoc on opponents. Moreover, CMGN is typically the first to report on scandals and disasters due to the fact that it directly orchestrates them. During one of Carver's daily teleconferences, various heads of his divisions smugly gloat over the terror they inflict upon the world: Jeff Hobbs reports ""floods in Pakistan, riots in Paris and a plane crash in California"" while Philip Jones has all current releases of CMG's software loaded with bugs, forcing consumers to endlessly upgrade. To boost his viewership, Carver instructs Tom Wallace to call the President of the United States and threaten to release scandalous photos of him with a cheerleader if he doesn't sign a bill lowering cable rates - and then to release the photos when he complies.
During the CMGN Satellite Network inaugural party, Carver denies claims that after British beef baron Sir Angus Black lost £10,000 in a game of poker to him and refused to pay up, he exacted revenge by releasing stories on Mad Cow Disease. He further retorted that there was even less truth to the rumor that the French paid him 100 million francs to keep the stories going.
Having been denied media presence in China, Carver attempts to provoke a war between them and the United Kingdom, hoping to wipe out the existing Chinese leadership in Beijing. This action would effectively allow the Carver Media Group secure exclusive broadcasting rights in China for the next century. To that end, Carver arranges for a stealth ship to be built, utilizing material smuggled by the Chinese general Chang. In return, Chang would be placed in the top seat within the Chinese government, while Carver would capitalize upon the coverage of the ensuing conflict.
During the initial phase of his plan, Carver sends American ""techno-terrorist"" Henry Gupta to purchase a GPS encoder (made by the American military) from a terrorist arms bazaar. Gupta then utilises the encoder to remotely interfere with the GPS systems of both the British HMS Devonshire and two Chinese MiG's. This sends the Navy frigate and Airforce jets off-course into what is perceived to be Chinese-held waters. Meanwhile, Carver has Richard Stamper and Captain Scott oversee the sinking of the Devonshire at the hands of his torpedo-like ""Sea-Vac"" drill (piloted by Timblin). From the Stealth Boat, Carver's forces unleash the Sea-Vac upon the warship and launch two guided missiles that obliterate the rival aircraft overhead. Carver then has his men eliminate the surviving crew with Chinese military-grade rounds while a diving team steals a cruise missile from the sunken ship.
Meanwhile, MI6 notices a spurious signal from one of the CMGN communications satellites, directed at the coordinates where the frigate was sunk. M sends James Bond to investigate Carver after his publication delivers news with critical details, hours ahead of competing media outlets. Bond travels to Hamburg and infiltrates Carver's launch party for his new satellite network. While posing as a banker, he meets the villain for the first time and also reunites with Paris. Carver develops an instant suspicion of Bond when the spy questions him about the applications of his satellites. He has his henchmen capture and attempt to interrogate Bond, but the spy escapes and cuts off power to Carver's live international broadcast, sabotaging the party and humiliating him.
Later, Carver learns by Gupta that Bond is a secret agent and commands Paris to get information from him as to why he was at the party and what he knows. Carver soon discovers that Paris and Bond are former lovers despite her claims that any former ties to the man were merely platonic. Feeling infuriated and betrayed, Carver has his wife killed by master assassin, Dr. Kaufman.
As Bond further investigates the Devonshire wreck, he discovers that the ship and aircraft had actually been in Vietnamese waters during the Stealth Ship's attack. During this time, Bond also discovers that People's External Security Force agent Wai Lin had also been probing Carver's activity. Previously, the two had encountered one another twice at Carver's Hamburg HQ - first at the launch party and later that subsequent day. The pair of agents are eventually captured by Stamper and taken to Carver at a CMGN tower in Saigon. Meeting with them, Carver reveals his plans to the pair and prepares to have them tortured by Stamper. However, they manage to escape and subsequently agree to collaborate on the investigation.
The two find Carver's stealth ship in Ha Long Bay and board it to prevent the madman from firing the stolen cruise missile at Beijing. During the battle, Wai Lin is captured but Bond manages to evade Carver's henchmen by using one of the guards to fake his death. On the ship's bridge, Bond captures Gupta to use as his own hostage. However, Carver kills Gupta as the final stage of the plan is set to go forth. Despite being cornered, Bond detonates an explosive, damaging the ship and making it visible to the Royal Navy's radar. Carver eventually sneaks up on Bond in the control room and holds him at gunpoint; he explains to Bond that by foolishly destroying the stealth ship, any evidence of Carver's actions is also destroyed. As the mogul pontificates, Bond secretly activates the Sea-Vac. With the roar of the drill having momentarily distracted the enemy, Bond is able to disarm him. He then holds a screaming Carver in front of the approaching drill and releases him at the last possible second, shredding him to pieces as Bond escapes.
Bond ultimately thwarts Carver's plan by positioning detonators on the missile to ensure its destruction before launch. With confirmation of Carver having expired in the Stealth Ship's destruction, M releases a news story stating that Carver went missing while on board his luxury yacht in the South China Sea, while the authorities believed he committed suicide.
Raymond Benson's novelization to the film adds more background to Carver's pre-film biography. The film itself mentioned that he previously worked for a newspaper in Hong Kong, but the novel reveals that he was the illegitimate son of the British newspaper baron Lord Roverman and a German prostitute. His mother died in childbirth, and his father paid a Hong Kong family to take him in. His foster father revealed on his deathbed who Carver's father really was. Carver went on to become a TV anchor in Hong Kong until he went to England to notify his father that he knew who he was, and his father tried to bribe him into never coming back. Carver then met Stamper and had him follow his father, and Stamper discovered that Lord Roverman was having an affair with an American prostitute and that he enjoyed dressing up in a Catholic school-girl's uniform while she spanked him. Carver tortured his father with this information until Lord Roverman re-wrote his will to make Carver his sole heir. Roverman then went back to America to find that Stamper had already murdered his mistress. Stamper then gave Roverman a gun and pressured him to commit suicide which he subsequently did. Roverman's wife and daughter tried to contest his will as they did not even know of Carver's existence, but Carver won in court and inherited his father's fortune.
Carver appears throughout several points in the narrative, ultimately serving as the game's final boss. While his role in the adaptation is largely unchanged from that of his film depiction, the final altercation differs significantly. Unlike in the film, Carver engages Bond in a deadly firefight, utilizing a powerful submachine gun rather than the handgun from the film. Upon losing the showdown, Carver slowly succumbs to his injuries but not before activating the stealth ship's self-destruct countdown. With his dying breath, Carver assures Bond that escape is futile and that his media empire shall live on. As he keels over, the player is able to pick up Carver's weapon as well as the keycard needed to deactivate the missile launch.  
Personality-wise, Carver is manipulative and vengeful, remorselessly murdering anyone he deems useless or a traitor. Carver is also vain and highly narcissistic, going so far as to decorate his headquarters and other places pertaining to his media empire, with tapestries and over sized banners that bear his visage. It also appears that Carver has a rather unique affinity for television screens since all of his bases are saturated with unusually grand quantities of video screens, some large enough to cover several meter-high walls.
Physically speaking, Carver poses no real threat and would much rather rely upon his vast legion of henchmen before getting involved in any altercations himself. Possessing a rather wiry frame coupled with a thinning head of neatly trimmed grey hair, Carver (in traditional Bond Villain fashion) is perpetually seen wearing a series of identical black Nehru suit jackets; the media baron usually wears these vestments over a black mock-neck shirt and matching dress slacks. His most distinguishing feature, perhaps, are his reflective steel rimmed glasses with which he is never seen without.

1224,/wiki/Fraizer,"Professor Fraizer is a solar energy scientist who appears in the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun. He was portrayed by Gerald James.
He is seen on the meeting with M, Q, Bond, and Hip on the wreckage of the liner Queen Elizabeth. He was there to talk with Gibson and check out his invention the Solex Agitator. But unfortunately the invention was stolen and the scientist was killed.
"
1225,/wiki/Edmund_Slate,"Edmund Slate was a fictional hitman sent to kill Camille Montes at the behest of her lover, environmentalist Dominic Greene. A minor antagonist portrayed by British actor Neil Jackson, the character appeared briefly in the 2008 James Bond film, Quantum of Solace.
After M's bodyguard Craig Mitchell reveals himself as a double agent for Quantum and gets killed by Bond, MI6 forensically examines the late operative's personal affects. Examining the contents of Mitchell's wallet, they find marked notes which had been introduced by MI6 into Quantum financier Le Chiffre's money-laundering operation.
Bills from the same series as Mitchell's were recently scanned at a bank in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and deposited in the account of a ""Mr. Slate"". They connect this to Edmund Slate, a gentleman returning to Port-au-Prince from Heathrow and staying in room 325 of the Hotel Dessalines.
James Bond is sent to the Hotel Dessalines to intercept Slate. Breaking into room 325, Bond is set upon by the knife-wielding hitman. After a vicious brawl, Slate is stabbed in the neck and endures a slow death.

1226,/wiki/Adam_Blackwood,"Adam Blackwood is an English actor who provided voices for various characters in the video game adaptations of Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough, as well as 007 Racing. Aside from his work on the 007 Franchise, Blackwood is best known for playing Balazar in the 1986 Doctor Who serial The Trial of a Time Lord.
"
1227,/wiki/Aztec_Complex,"The Amazonian launch complex was a fictional covert space-shuttle launch site constructed by billionaire industrialist, Hugo Drax, and was concealed among the ruins of an extinct ancient civilization near the River Tapirapé, in north-central Brazil. The facility appeared prominently in the 1979 James Bond film, Moonraker. The iconic location would later be inspiration for a level in the 1997 video-game, Goldeneye 007, and would be re-imagined as a private space-tourism port for the 2012 game, 007 Legends.
The secret Moonraker launch complex is constructed under and around the ruins of an extinct Mesoamerican civilization, rendered infertile by long-term exposure to the pollen of the Orchidae Nigra (or 'black orchid'). The orchid continues to grow among the ancient stone structures and has been weaponized into a nerve agent by Drax's scientists as part of his scheme to wipe out humanity and repopulate the Earth with his 'master race'.
James Bond stumbles upon the launch site whilst searching for the source of the orchid toxin and is lured by one of Drax's girls into an ancient pyramid structure. In an idyllic garden cavern he is tossed into a pool of water by a hidden mechanism, and is forced to kill a large constricting snake to escape the death trap. He is dragged from the water by Jaws and is brought to an angular Launch Control Center lined with monitors. There he witnesses the launch of the shuttles and Drax reveals his plans. Bond and his CIA contact, Dr. Holly Goodhead, are then left to die in a flame exhaust pit under Moonraker #5 and narrowly escape by blowing apart a vent cover. The pair disguise themselves as pilots and escape the complex by riding on Moonraker #6.
Known for its reputation as one of the hardest levels in the game, featured enemies include hidden drone guns and an infinite number of re-spawning Moonraker Elites armed with US AR33 rifles, Moonraker laser rifles and grenades. Jaws appears in this level as an enemy, dual wielding AR33 rifles. After defeating Jaws and pocketing his key-card, Bond must enter the computer room, reprogram the guidance system and launch the shuttle in the hangar to complete the mission.
"
1228,/wiki/Alec_Trevelyan_(Elliot_Cowan),"According to MI6 records, Alec Trevelyan graduated from Sandhurst Military Collage in 1995 and served with the British parachute regiment between '96 and '97. He operated with MI6 as a European field agent from March 2004 and became Section Lead in February of 2005. In 2006 he was promoted and was assigned 00 status in July 2007 with the number 006.
In the 2010 video-game adaptation of GoldenEye, Trevelyan's motives have changed. Whereas the original story saw him seeking revenge against Britain for the death of his Cossack family, he now wishes to wreck the current banking system. Trevelyan is disgusted by the way soldiers and agents like himself are no longer able to fight for Queen and country - all their efforts now seem to go towards propping up the bankers. Once again, he implies that he would have let Bond in on his plan if it wasn't for the fact that he ""only ever cares for the mission - never his friends"".
As opposed to the Cuban antenna cradle from the original, Trevelyan now intends to conduct his plan using a solar collector tower in Nigeria. He plans to use the collector tower to access the second orbiting GoldenEye satellite, using it to steal all the money from the banks before detonating it in orbit to create an enormous electromagnetic pulse, cutting off the banks' financial records and erasing all evidence of the theft.
During a fight between Bond and Trevelyan in the control room of the solar tower, Trevelyan's computers are destroyed, making the theft impossible to complete. Trevelyan then plans to detonate the satellite anyway in a final attempt to cripple the banks. The last control console is conveniently placed on the antenna, a platform placed at the front of the tower, high above the ground zoverlooking the solar plant. After a second vicious fight with Trevelyan, Bond manages to use the console to abort the detonation and reprogram the satellite so that it will crash onto the Cradle. A weakened Trevelyan, who now stands on the edge of the platform after a sudden explosion caused them both to slide towards the edge, smugly asks ""For England, James?"", to which Bond replies ""No. For me."" Bond then shoots Trevelyan several times, knocking him off the platform and sending him plummeting to his demise.
This adaption of Alec Trevelyan appears far more arrogant than the Sean Bean portrayal. He is almost unconvincingly suave and has a more xenophobic sense of humor. He is also very overconfident, as he dares Bond to do better than he is already during their fight. He has no visible relationship with Xenia Onatopp, who only appears in a small number of scenes without Alec in the picture. He also has a far more brutal fighting style than he does in the film, using objects around him and the environment to his advantage, as shown when he uses a fire extinguisher and a steel axe against Bond. He is a lot more daring during this fight scene, as he strangles and also headbutts Bond in order to overpower him. He also tries to push Bond’s head into a beam of focused sunlight.

1229,/wiki/Caroline_Munro,"Caroline Munro is an English actress and model known for her many appearances in horror, science fiction and action films of the 1970s and 1980s. She played the Bond girl Naomi in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me. In the film, Naomi was the helicopter pilot/henchwoman for the evil villain Karl Stromberg.

"
1230,/wiki/Blonde_Beauty_(Irka_Bochenko),"Blonde Beauty is a fictional character in the James Bond film Moonraker. She is portrayed by French-Polish actress Irka Bochenko and is a henchwoman for Hugo Drax.
The Blonde Beauty is one of Drax's Girls. Bond first encounters her at Venini Glass, where she works as a receptionist. She asks if she can interest him in something, and he says he will have a look around, to which she tells him to go anywhere he wishes. As he leaves, she has a devious look on her face.
After Bond lands in the jungle, he sees a woman in a white robe walking under a waterfall and into the woods and follows her to a temple. Once she arrives, the woman turns around to reveal herself as the blonde receptionist. She lures Bond inside the temple, where there is a waterfall. She walks over a bridge and signals for him to follow her, as the other girls reveal themselves. Bond walks closer to the water and is dropped in by a trap door as a python swims into the water, and the blonde beauty and her friends watch him with devious smiles. Bond manages to escape the trap.
Her final fate is unknown, but she presumably dies when the space station explodes.
The Blonde Beauty seems to be the leader of Drax's Girls, due to the fact that her uniform was different from all of the other girls when they lure Bond into a trap.

"
1232,/wiki/Hector_Gonzales,"Hector Gonzales was a fictional Cuban hitman hired by Aris Kristatos to murder the Havelocks and the quaternary antagonist in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only. Portrayed by actor Stefan Kalipha, the character is based to Major Gonzales, a character in the 1960 short-story For Your Eyes Only, and would later to be appears in the comic adaptation of the film by Marvel Comics.
Hector Gonzales is employed by Greek smuggler Aris Kristatos to kill Sir Timothy Havelock, the man who was employed by MI6 to find the sunken ship containing the ATAC device. Gonzales poses as a pilot for the Athens-based Kerkyra Charter Service in order to murder Havelock and his wife, Iona. He flies Timothy and Iona's daughter Melina to her parents' research ship, the Triana in Corfu Harbour. He then turns his seaplane around and flies back to the Triana. Mr. & Mrs. Havelock believe that Gonzales is making the return voyage and wave goodbye to him, only to learn too late that he opened fire on them. Prior to this, Melina had given her parents gifts she brought from the mainland and went into the cabin to give a bag of cashews for Max, the pet parrot of the Havelocks. Melina's decision to feed Max spared her life as she was shielded from the gunfire. She is startled by the noises and rushes topside, only to see both of her parents shot and dying almost instantly.
The Greek police identify Gonzales using Melina's description. Through a detective agency, Melina tracks Gonzales to a villa outside Madrid, Spain. After Gonzales receives a payment from his employer, Aris Kristatos' henchman Locque for the Havelock murders, he finds that Bond has been snooping around his party. Bond is searched and his firearm is confiscated, to which Gonzales remarks Bond is part of MI6 as his pistol is a standard issue Walther PPK, and for him to be ""taken away"". Immediately afterward Melina, hiding in nearby bushes, shoots him in the back with her crossbow simultaneously as he dives in to the swimming pool. In the resulting chaos Bond and Melina escapes.
Gonzales's death raises the ire of Bond's superiors, who ordered him to interrogate Gonzales, ""not perforate him"" (although Bond was not the killer). Bond saves his skin by pointing out (the not-yet identified) Locque was the connection they needed. This also causes Melina to resume her vendetta as she realises Gonzales was only the pawn in the murder of her parents.

1235,/wiki/Cadence_Birdwhistle,"Cadence Birdwhistle is a fictional Forensic Accountant for the MI6, and a main character in the 2016 James Bond comic Eidolon.
Cadence Birdwhistle was a forensic accountant for MI6 who was undercover at the Turkish Consulate in Los Angeles. While working there she discovered some illegal transactions but in doing so broke her cover, so Agent 007 was sent to extract her before the Turkish government could harm her. As they drove to the airport they were attacked by MIT operatives from the Turkish government, but Bond managed to escape them. Unfortunately, the Los Angeles International Airport had been temporarily closed due to a bomb threat.
She and Bond stayed at an MI6 safehouse, but were attacked by two CIA agents at the airport the next day. Then, while pulling out of the Heathrow airport, they were attacked again by two gunmen, but were unharmed due to their heavily armored car. They got back to the MI6 headquarters at Vauxhall Cross, where she, with the help of an I-Branch specialist, traced the money back through MI5 with shell companies called ""Eidolon"". She, M, Miss Moneypenny, and MI5 agent Eve Sharma then presented their findings to the Commissioner of Defense, who was killed by MI5's head Sir Stephen Mackmain of MI5, and so Sharma and 007 gave chase to the other assassin, Beckett Hawkwood of the Eidolon cell within MI5, but he escaped.
While walking through London to bring some additional research to the government, Birdwhistle discovered Hawkwood in town. She called Bond, who had been tailing her with two other operatives, who were quickly defeated, but 007 was able to corner him and defeat him.
"
1236,/wiki/Czechoslovak_People%27s_Army,"The Czechoslovak People's Army or ČSLA were the official armed forces of Czechoslovakia during the communist era. They consisted of ground forces, an air force air defense forces.
The military got its name in 1954, and changed back to their old name 'Czechoslovak Army' in 1990, before being split up in both Czech and Slovakian militaries. 
Before the 1938 Munich Agreement, the Czechoslovak Army was one of the strongest in Europe. As a member of the Warsaw Pact, all units of the ČSLA were attached to the Soviet military.
In 'The Living Daylights', a group of ČSLA soldiers is deployed in order to stop James Bond and Kara Milovy from exiting the country. As the VB was unable to stop the Aston Martin V8 Vantage Volante, the military was called to support the 'public security' forces.
As the Cold War was still going on in 1987, the producers could not get any real Czechoslovakian military equipment, therefore a large variety of material has been used.
"
1237,/wiki/Bloodstone,"In 2010, after stopping a terrorist from destroying a fundraiser, Bond is given a new assignment, a scientist who specializes in biological engineering goes missing, presumed dead as his boat was found capsized in the ocean. The US Echelon system picks up a cell phone call that pertains to his disappearance that he is alive and the call was made in Istanbul. Bond is sent to investigate whether it was the scientist or not. Posing as professor of the British Museum, James investigates the foreman's office but was already found out and he manages to escape before the trailer was put in the pit. James manages to head down to the catacombs and heard the scientist reveal codes to a man and is soon killed before Bond could save him. Bond chases down the man who was interrogating him and learns that he was hired to interrogate the scientist by a man named Pomerov.
Using an MI6 cover agent, fashion-designer Nicole Hunter, who has ties to Pomerov, Bond infiltrates a Casino owned by him while Nicole meets with him as a way to get Bond in without Pomerov noticing. Bond finds incriminating evidence in Pomerov's safe, and it's revealed that he had the scientist kidnapped and interrogated to create weaponized biological agents from vaccinations that the scientist was working on but triggers an alarm and fights his way out to Nicole.
Again, using Nicole as cover for Bond's infiltration, he heads to a facility in Siberia to determine whether Pomerov is indeed creating WMDs, and upon learning that such is the case, Bond destroys the facility, hunts Pomerov down, and eliminates him before he can flee the country.
Thought it seems that everything is wrapped up, Bond concludes that some third party tipped MI6 off about what was happening in Istanbul, as the scientist couldn't have made the calls that MI6 believed him to have made, being that he was imprisoned at the time. Bond sets out to discover the who and why.
Finding himself in Bangkok, Bond meets with Colonel Ping who claims to know who was really behind it all: a criminal named Rak. Suddenly, Rak's men attack and kill the officer, but Bond survives and hunts down the assassin, who confirms that Rak has something to do with everything. Unable to find Rak on his own, Bond meets with an old acquaintance while evading the police for causing many property damage in the chase with Ping's assassin before he was killed. He learns of Rak's location. He double-crosses Bond however, and informs Rak that Bond is on his way. Upon finding Rak, Bond is captured and brought to Burma.
In Burma, Rak is about to torture Bond with a jewel-encrusted knife, but is suddenly called away to deal with urgent matters. Bond takes this opportunity to escape, hunt Rak down again, and finally eliminate him. Before his death, Rak informs Bond that he was actually working for someone, stating that he'll offer up who hired him to have the scientist kidnapped in the first place if Bond spares his life, but Bond refuses the offer, as the knife Rak used to torture his victims was encrusted in the same jewels used by Nicole Hunter in her fashion-line.
Bond hunts down Nicole and interrogates her, learning that she, too, was working for a higher organization as a double agent. Nicole says she did it to prove herself to the unknown powerful head of the organization, who she claims is bigger than any organization in the world, including MI6. However, before Bond is able to interrogate her further, an unmanned drone passes by shoots Nicole dead. With no further cues to follow, Bond reports to M, advising her to find a new contact in Monaco, before departing.
Due to the game's intended sequel being cancelled, the identify of the man Nicole was describing at the end of the game was never revealed. However, with the release of Spectre in 2015 and the reveal that the villains of Craig's previous 3 films were all agents of SPECTRE; many have retroactively speculated that the person Nicole was referring to was Ernst Stravro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE. However, this is highly unlikely to be the case considering MGM didn't regain the rights to SPECTRE and Blofeld until 2013, 3 years after the game was released. 
The game was hinted on April 21, 2010, when a British retailer listed ""Blood Stone"". Two days later Activision was later registering a domain name called bloodstonethegame.com. The game was officially announced on July 16 later that year.
James Bond film writer Bruce Feirstein was chosen to pen the story for the game. The game itself is built on developer Bizarre Creations' Bespoke engine, which was first created for the game The Club. Ben Cooke, who is Daniel Craig's stunt double in the films, has provided the motion capture choreography for Bond's digital animation. He is credited as the game's stunt coordinator.
Joss Stone provides the main title introduction song with an original soundtrack called ""I'll Take it All"".
Blood Stone is a third-person shooter game similar to games like Uncharted, Gears of War and Splinter Cell and with an elements of stealth, similar to Splitner Cell: Conviction, Blood Stone has a ""Focus Aim"" system that lets you accurately shoot enemy which is unlocked by taking an enemy with melee combat.

Due to being invited to the Highland Games by Murik at Ascot, Bond is challenged in a wrestling duel to Caber, known as the undefeated Champion of Glen Murcaldy. Bond manages to defeat Caber, though he uses Q'ute's Dunhill lighter filled with the anesthetic Halothane, which he sprays on Caber's mouth and nose. Though Caber is still in control, Bond twists Caber's arm, and sends him unconscious on his back. Murik then proclaims Bond as the new Champion of Murcaldy.
After Bond is recaptured after the shootout, Murik transports Bond to Perpignan, France. There, Bond escapes at the airport in an attempt to telephone M and Bill Tanner at MI6 of Murik's ""Operation Meltdown"". At the corner of the Place de la Résistance, Bond is pursued by Caber and three other Scotsmen. He manages to escape them and make a call at a café, and MI6 traces the call to Bond's location.
Shortly after the deaths of Franco and Mary Jane Mashkin, Bond is captured again by Caber and his men, and is tied aboard Murik's Lockheed-Georgia C-14 Starlifter. Bond releases himself, knocks Murik unconscious, and foils Murik's ransom plot calling off the terrorist squads. Caber, whom had returned after eating aboard, engages in a fierce battle with Bond that ends with Lavender Peacock slitting Caber's throat, and his body falling out of the rear of the plane.

Investigating the disappearance of British Secret Service operative, John Strangways, Bond discovers a link between the missing man and radioactive rocks taken from Crab Key - a private island belonging to the reclusive Dr. Julius No. 007 asks local fisherman Quarrel to take him there under the cover of darkness. However, Quarrel is reluctant to do so, stating that there is a dragon on the island. Despite his initial reluctance, he agrees to take Bond to Crab Key. After inadvertently alerting the Doctor's security forces to their presence on the Island, fellow intruder Honey Ryder guides them to a hiding place up stream. Arriving at the hiding spot, they agree to take turns watching out for the dragon, which Honey claims to have seen. When Quarrel spots tracks, Bond insists they follow them to the dragon. The trio follow the tracks until night falls. Eventually they come across a barren swamp, where they are spotted by the ""dragon"" - an armored vehicle painted with teeth and armed with a flamethrower. As it approaches them Bond and Quarrel attempt to shoot out its tires and lights. They fail and Quarrel is torched to death. Bond and Honey are apprehended by the tank crew and are taken to a compound.
In 1985, the vehicle was re-imagined for a children's talking storybook adaptation of 1962's Dr. No, published in North America by Kid Stuff Records & Tapes. As in the film, Bond encounters the ""Dragon"" whilst investigating suspicious activity on Crab Key. As he wades through the mangroves, pursued by guards and their dogs, he is ambushed by the Dragon - a large Jeep Wrangler, apparently from the illustrations, equipped with twin flame-throwers. He surrenders to its driver, and is knocked unconscious and taken prisoner.

Located at MI6 in the Bahamas, Bond discovers where he lives on the island and knows his wife, Solange, riding a beautiful white horse on the beach. In the evening at the casino, Bond sits down at a poker table where Dimitrios ais playing. The game continues until Solange appears, but she is berated by her husband for lateness, hinting at his recent bad luck with the cards. At one point, Dimitrios, decided to recover his losses, goes all-in and raises the stakes with a check, but is warned by the croupier that the players are only allowed to bet what's on the table; he then decides to bet his car, an Aston Martin DB5, the keys of which were already on the table. Bond convinces the croupier to allow Dimitrios to bet the car, and goes all-in. At first, Dimitrios' confidence in his hand (three kings) seems to pay off, but Bond reveals his hand (three aces) shortly after, and wins: the Aston Martin, together with Dimitrios' cash, is his.
After the game, Dimitrios meets Le Chiffre on his luxury yacht to receive instructions while Bond, having seduced Solange after appearing in front of her with her husband's car, makes love with the woman in the villa where he stayed, to get more information about Alex. Dimitrios calls his wife saying he will have to go to Miami, allowing Bond to go after him.

1253,/wiki/Bird_1,"Osato Chemicals and EngineeringA two-stage rocket, Bird One uses two vehicles mounted on top of another, each of which contains its own engines and propellant. It is piloted by two astronauts from a cramped cockpit in the second-stage orbiter. When it runs out of propellant, the first stage is jettisoned in low orbit and presumably burns up in the Earth's atmosphere. The second stage vehicle continues to orbit under its own power. The orbiter has a segmented nose that can be opened to engulf smaller space vehicles within its cavity. Before it re-enters the atmosphere, the craft is oriented with its aft section pointing 'downwards' towards its landing destination; an orientation that keeps the vehicle's heat shields facing the majority of the heat generated by friction. Within the atmosphere the orbiter jettisons its heat shield to reveal a set of rocket boosters which control the vehicle's descent. On landing, three landing struts extend from Bird One's sides and it lands vertically. Notably, the orbiter is equipped with a remote self-destruct mechanism.

1254,/wiki/Francisco_Scaramanga_(Literary),"Francisco Scaramanga, of Spanish Catalan origin, became a trick shot in a circus act while a youngster, and he also cared for one of the circus elephants. When the elephant went on a rampage and Scaramanga witnessed a policeman kill him, the enraged boy retaliated by killing the police officer with a single shot through the heart. He then made his way to the United States, where he found employment as an enforcer for the Spangled Mob, an outfit that plays a role in two other Bond novels; Diamonds Are Forever, where they were the main foe of agent 007, and Goldfinger as an accomplice to Auric Goldfinger's Operation Grandslam.
By the time Bond finally encounters him in The Man with the Golden Gun, Scaramanga is a Caribbean gunman who often works for Fidel Castro's secret police in addition to being engaged in other criminal enterprises such as drug-running into the United States in partnership with the KGB. His signature weapon, a gold-plated .45-calibre revolver with custom-made gold core bullets, has earned him the title 'The Man with the Golden Gun'. He is responsible for the deaths of agents 267 (British Guiana), 398 (Trinidad), 943 (Jamaica) and 768 and 742 (Havana) and for the maiming of 098. Bond's service has evaluated him as one of the finest shots in the world, and M authorizes Bond to assassinate Scaramanga— if he can.
Bond catches up with Scaramanga in Jamaica, where Bond pretends to be a freelance security officer, and Scaramanga hires him to guard an upcoming meeting of gangsters. During the meeting, a KGB officer blows Bond's cover, subsequently pitting Scaramanga and Bond in a shootout. Bond wounds Scaramanga, but before he can finish the gunman off, Scaramanga shoots Bond with a poisoned bullet from his backup weapon, a golden Derringer. Bond returns fire, killing Scaramanga instantly; soon thereafter, a policeman finds the nearly dead Bond in time to save him.
In the novel, British intelligence also has an in-depth psychological profile on Scaramanga, which is printed in the book before the mission begins. The profile (read by M) is unusually disturbing in describing his background and psyche. The profile also claims that Scaramanga is a latent homosexual.
Ian Fleming named Francisco Scaramanga after a fellow student at Eton with whom he shared a lasting rivalry. Following several schoolground spats Fleming decided to use the animosity he felt towards George Scaramanga for the influence behind one of his most famous villains. Fleming and Scaramanga were at Eton in the 1930s until the Bond author was expelled.

1255,/wiki/Casino_Royale_(2006_film),"Casino Royale is the twenty-first film in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions. It served as a series reboot, resetting its continuity to the start of Bond's career as a 00 and was the first to feature Daniel Craig as 007. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and adapted for the screen by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis.
Based on the 1953 novel Casino Royale by Ian Fleming, it is the first Bond film to take its title from an Ian Fleming novel or short story since 1987's The Living Daylights, and the first to be directly based on any of Fleming's writing's since 1989's Licence to Kill (although several films in the interim, such as the preceding Die Another Day, had incorporated some story elements from Fleming). It is also considered to be the first more-or-less faithful adaptation of a full-length Fleming novel since 1973's Live and Let Die as all the films in the interim had either only used selected elements from Fleming's novels, were based upon short stories (requiring substantial expansion), or were original works. This film marks the third screen-adaptation of Casino Royale, which was previously a 1954 television episode and a 1967 film spoof; however, as an EON production, the 2006 release is considered the only ""official"" adaptation of Fleming's novel.
In the film, Bond must defeat criminal banker Le Chiffre in a high-stakes game of poker to thwart his criminal organisation from funding terrorists. He is aided by CIA agent Felix Leiter and HM Treasury liaison Vesper Lynd.
In Prague, Czech Republic, James Bond has tracked down an MI6 section chief, Dryden, who was selling secrets to enemies for profit. They chat about what it takes to be a Double-O agent (one of the requirements is making two kills) and Bond casually tells Dryden that his espionage contact, Fisher died, and ""Not well."" Intercut with the conversation are black and white scenes of Bond and Dryden's contact fighting in a men's room. Bond finally pushes the man's face into an overflowing sink and holds him there until he falls to the floor, apparently dead.
Dryden points a gun at Bond. ""Shame. We barely got to know each other."" He pulls the trigger, but James has removed the ammunition from the weapon. ""I know where you keep your gun. I suppose that's something."" Dryden continues to taunt Bond, asking him if he felt any remorse or guilt over killing Fisher. Bond remains passive, his face expressionless. Dryden says that Bond ""needn't worry, the second is--"" at which point Bond kills Dryden. Bond puts his pistol away saying, ""Yes, considerably."" (Though not said explicitly, Bond found the killing of Dryden, his second such kill, ""considerably"" easier than the first.) In flashback, Fisher recovers from Bond's attempt to drown him and picks up his pistol. The frame instantly shifts to the series' iconic ""gun barrel"" sequence. Bond spins around and shoots the man. Blood runs down the frame, prompting the opening titles.
The scene shifts to Uganda, where the terrorist group known as the Lord's Resistance Army is meeting with Le Chiffre, a private banker to terrorist groups around the world. The broker for the deal is a Mr. White, who invests their money and manipulates stocks so they get a 100% return on the investment. The Lord's Resistance Army, represented by a man named Steven Obanno, agree to allow the money to be loaned to Le Chiffre for his nefarious purposes.
In Madagascar, Bond is working with another MI6 agent, Carter, monitoring a terrorist, Mollaka, who is gambling on a fight between a cobra and a mongoose. Carter, who is inexperienced, is exposed after Mollaka gets a cell phone call and the terrorist bolts from the scene. Bond chases Mollaka, who is an experienced ""free runner"", who leads Bond through a construction site, onto several cranes and finally to the Nambutu embassy where he seeks asylum. Bond charges into the embassy, in direct contravention of international law and his orders, and catches Mollaka. Bond fights his way through the halls of the embassy and finds himself surrounded by armed guards. The ambassador appears and orders Bond to let Mollaka go. Bond shoots Mollaka and a nearby gas tank and escapes in the explosion. He also steals the backpack Mollaka was carrying. Searching through the backpack, he finds a cell phone and a bomb. Bond examines the man's messages briefly, seeing one with an American phone number and the word ""ellipsis."" Bond keeps the phone.
Back at MI6, M is furious that 007's violent actions were caught on tape at the Nambutu embassy. Bond later sneaks into M's home and hacks her top-level clearance so he can trace where the cell phone call originated from. When M enters, she is startled and lectures him on proper protocol and conduct. She thought it was a mistake to give him 00 status. Bond assures her that ""the life expectancy of a 00 is brief, so your mistake will be short-lived."" M tells him that ""arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand-in-hand"" and she wanted him to take his ego out of the equation when on a mission. She also tells him to go on a brief vacation until she can decide how best to deal with him. As Bond goes to leave, M tells Bond to never break into her house again (something he will do again in Skyfall).
Bond had discovered that the call to Mollaka originated in the Bahamas, so he goes there to investigate who made the call and why. He ends up finding a middleman, Alex Dimitrios, who was working for Le Chiffre and that he was hired to find someone who could carry out a task for Le Chiffre. Bond meets Dmitrios and plays poker with him, winning his 1964 Aston Martin in the process. Bond uses the Aston to finagle a romantic evening with Dmitrios' spurned wife, Solange, to get information about her husband. She tells Bond that Dmitrios is going to Miami.
Bond follows him there where he confronts Dimitrios, after seeing him put a bag away for someone to pick up later. Bond kills Dimitrios when he's held at knifepoint; however, the bag goes missing and Bond follows the man, Carlos, hired for Mollaka's job. Bond follows Carlos to Miami International Airport, where he pulls a security uniform out of the bag and puts it on. He slips into the secure area of the airport and Bond follows him, having figured out ""ellipsis"" was the security code to get through the door. M calls Bond to tell him Le Chiffre will have Carlos destroy the prototype for a large airline named Skyfleet. The prototype is the largest passenger aircraft in the world and destroying it will bankrupt Skyfleet. Carlos sets off the emergency sprinkler system in the building to cause a diversion, forcing everybody out of the airport and slips out onto the tarmac. Carlos attaches an explosive charge disguised as a keyring to a refueling tanker and starts driving it towards the plane. However, Bond manages to leap onto the tanker. The two have a vicious fight all the way around the runways while being chased by the Miami-Dade Police. Eventually, Carlos leaps off the truck, and Bond is barely able to stop the tanker from hitting the plane. Carlos smiles as Bond is arrested and sets off the charge. However, Bond had discovered Carlos' small explosive device & attached it to Carlos' belt during the melee, and Carlos ends up killing himself by accident.
Upon returning to Nassau, Bond discovers that Solange had been murdered, when MI6 find her drowned corpse in a fishing boat net. M explains she was tortured and killed by Le Chiffre because she was the only one left alive and he assumed she talked. Le Chiffre's plan was to ""short-sell"" hundreds of millions of dollars in Skyfleet stock and, in destroying their prototype, cause their stock to plummet and send them into bankruptcy. Thanks to Bond, Le Chiffre loses over $101 million dollars. Now a marked man, Le Chiffre must find another way to earn the money back so his investors will not kill him. He sets up a high stakes poker match ain Montenegro for ten players, with entry fees at $10 million each plus a $5 million buy back should they lose all their money. M informs Bond of the poker game at the Casino Royale, which is in Montenegro, and agrees to let Bond continue the mission since he's the best poker player in the service. M also implants a homing device in Bond's left forearm so she can track him anywhere.
The British Government put up the money and send along Vesper Lynd, a representative of HM Treasury, to monitor Bond and give a go, no-go should he lose the money. They talk on the train about each other, Vesper commenting on his cold nature and Bond remarking on how Vesper is retentive. Upon arriving they pose as a married couple and meet René Mathis, their contact in Montenegro. Each poker player has their money in a Swiss bank in Escrow while they play, and each one has a password to keep the money secured. Vesper has the account number, but only 007 knows the password. On the first hand, 007 loses a chunk of cash to figure out how Le Chiffre bluffs (his physical ""tell"" involves him placing his left hand near his wounded eye); however, Vesper is not at all impressed, thinking Bond is inept. After a lengthy round of hands, a break is called. Bond places a tracking device in Le Chiffre's inhaler and takes Vesper back to their room.
Le Chiffre is called back to his room by his girlfriend, Valenka. However, he was confronted by Obanno and his henchman, demanding his money back. They threaten to cut off Valenka's arm; however, Le Chiffre doesn't acquiesce, even with this mutlation. Out in the hallway, Bond hears Valenka screaming. He quickly grabs Vesper and they kiss in the stairway entrance to cover themselves. Obanno's henchman notices Bond's earpiece and attacks them both. The fight takes them into the stairwell, where the henchman gets thrown off the stairwell to his death, and Bond and Obanno have a knock-down drag-out fight all the way down the stairwell. Finally landing on the bottom, Bond gets Obanno into a chokehold. Obanno tries to reach for Bond's gun, but Vesper smashes it out of his hands. Bond kills Obanno and orders Vesper to contact Mathis, who sets up a man to take the fall for the dead bodies by placing them in the man's car trunk. Bond finishes the poker session, but he returns to the room to find Vesper shaking uncontrollably in the shower from the fight. He holds on to her and comforts her.
The next day, during the continuing poker game, Bond loses all his money to Le Chiffre after misreading a bluff and admits to Vesper that he made a mistake. Vesper won't give him the buy back money, saying he's going to lose it. Furious, 007 goes after Le Chiffre but is stopped by one of the other poker players, Felix Leiter, an agent sent by the CIA to the poker match to catch Le Chiffre. Leiter tells 007 that he's doing poorly himself in the game and that he'll back Bond to re-enter the game; Leiter believes that Bond can beat Le Chiffre. In return, Bond will give Le Chiffre to the CIA. Bond slowly builds his bank again and once again becomes a threat to Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre has Valenka poison Bond's martini with digitalis, causing Bond to suffer severe tachycardia. Bond goes to his car, distressed and, communicating with medical specialists at MI6 Headquarters, is about to use the defibrillator when he sees the connection isn't plugged in and passes out. Vesper arrives, fixes the defibrillator kit and shocks him back to life. Bond, shaken, returns to the game. The final hand of the game is down to four players, including Bond and Le Chiffre, who all go ""all in"", betting their remaining money, driving the ""pot"" amount to well over $120 million. One man has a flush, while another has a full house. Le Chiffre has a higher full house and is about to take the entire pot. Bond reveals he has a straight flush and wins the game and all the money.
Bond has dinner with Vesper, who receives a call from Mathis stating that Le Chiffre has been apprehended by the CIA. Vesper leaves the dining room; seconds later, Bond realizes she's in danger. Vesper is kidnapped by Le Chiffre. Bond races after them in his Aston Martin, but has to swerve violently when he sees Vesper lying bound in the road. The car rolls several times, destroying it and injuring Bond, rendering him unconscious. Le Chiffre and his cronies take him, remove his homing implant and take him and Vesper to a nearby tramp steamer. Bond is stripped naked and bound to a chair with the seat removed, leaving his testicles exposed. Le Chiffre uses a large knotted rope, striking Bond's scrotum, demanding the password for the account the winnings have been secured in. Bond refuses, despite Le Chiffre's threats to kill him and Vesper. Le Chiffre finally draws a knife and is about to castrate Bond when gunshots are heard outside. The door opens and Mr. White, the broker from the first scene with Obanno, walks in. Le Chiffre pleads with him, saying he'll secure the money, to which White replies, ""Money isn't as important to our organization as knowing who to trust."" White shoots Le Chiffre in the forehead, killing him.
Bond wakes up in a hospital bed during a haze while he recovers. He talks to Mathis, whom he believes was responsible for his and Vesper's capture by Le Chiffre. MI6 agents appear, taze Mathis and drag him away. Vesper visits Bond and they confess their love for each other. The Swiss banker in charge of the winnings account visits and Bond gives Vesper the password to key in; the password is her own first name. 
Bond resigns from the service to go away with Vesper, and they sail to Venice, Italy where Vesper says she'll get the money and Bond will get the supplies for the trip. When M phones 007 about his resignation, she says that they need to talk about the money being returned to the British government first, which tips off 007 that Vesper was using him all along. 007 follows Vesper to a secret meeting where she turns the money over, in cash, to a man named Adolph Gettler. Gettler and a few of his men retreat to a building being renovated and a gunfight ensues. Bond shoots and ruptures the flotation bags that hold the building above water-level and fights with them all, killing them. He tries to save Vesper, locked in an old elevator, but is unable to after she commits suicide by drowning herself. Bond recovers her body and takes her above water but is unable to revive her. Mr. White, who'd been watching the scene, is seen leaving with the suitcase full of money.
Sitting on the sailboat he and Vesper had been vacationing on, Bond talks to M, who informs him that Vesper had a boyfriend who was being held by Le Chiffre's organization, Quantum. She had intended to pay off Le Chiffre's associates with the money to secure her boyfriend's release. M believes that there are no further leads, that the ""trail has gone cold."" Bond examines Vesper's cell phone and finds the phone number of Mr. White, which he theorized she left for him on purpose. At Lake Como in Northern Italy, White arrives at a palatial estate. After he exits his car, he receives a phone call from someone telling him they ""need to talk."" Asking who the caller is, White is suddenly shot in the leg by a sniper. He falls to the ground and crawls toward the house. As he tries to climb the stairs and the familiar Bond theme begins to play, Bond appears, carrying a cell phone and an HK rifle. As White looks up defiantly, Bond says ""The name's Bond. James Bond.""
Casino Royale received positive reaction from critics. The film holds a 95% rating, based on 220 reviews, on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus that, ""Casino Royale disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent James Bond outings, and Daniel Craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for: a caustic, haunted, intense reinvention of 007."" The film holds an average score of 81 out of 100 on Metacritic, signifying ""universal acclaim"". Craig's performance and credibility received acclaim from fans and critics alike. Roger Moore, who has portrayed Bond in seven films, wrote, ""Daniel Craig impressed me so greatly in his debut outing, Casino Royale, by introducing a more gritty, unrefined edge to the character that I thought Sean Connery might just have to move over."" Craig's portrayal was thought of as ironic, brutal and cold. 
Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer said that the film is the first Bond film, ""that I would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10-best list."" He also said Daniel Craig was the most ""effective"" and ""appealing"" Bond yet.
Casino Royale was a box office success, earning $599,045,960 worldwide. It was the 4th-highest grossing film of 2006, and was the highest-grossing installment to the James Bond franchise until Skyfall surpassed it in November 2012.
The DVD and Blu-ray for Casino Royale were released on March 13, 2007. The two-disc collector's edition Blu-ray was released on October 21, 2008. Casino Royale will also be part of the Bond 50 Blu-ray set.

1256,/wiki/Damballah,"Dambala was a fictional skilled reptile handler affiliated with Dr. Kananga's voodoo cult. A minor villain, the character first appeared in the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die, portrayed by the late Bermudian actor Michael Ebbin, and was also seen in the James Bond 007 tabletop role-playing game.
Dambala is the chief of a tribe living on the fictional island of San Monique, which is governed by Kananga, who is secretly behind the appearances of Dambala's god, Baron Samedi, who he needs to use to get Dambala to eliminate his enemies via sacrifices to Baron Samedi. We see one such sacrifice at the end of the pre-titles sequence: MI6 agent Baines is tied to an altar, being menaced with a venomous snake by Dambala as the rest of the tribe dance as part of their strange ritual. Eventually, Dambala throws blood over Baines, and then holds the snake in his face, causing it to bite him to death. Later in the film, Kananga's unfaithful medium Solitaire faces the same fate, as she is tied to the altar facing the insane Dambala and his snake. However, she is temporarily saved when a statue of Baron Samedi appears, and is mistaken for the real Baron Samedi by Dambala, who is distracted.

1259,/wiki/Anya_Amasova_(Barbara_Bach),"When the British HMS Ranger and the Soviet submarine Potemkin are captured, M recalls James Bond from a mission where he is currently in a cabin located in Austria. While leaving Bond is ambushed by a Russian team lead by Sergei Barsov, but is able to kill Barsov in self-defense prior to parachuting off the mountain, unbeknownst that the agent was Amasova's lover. Later, Anya has also been recalled from a mission by General Gogol of the KGB.
Anya meets Bond during a show at the Pyramids in Egypt, where her thugs fight with Bond when she believes he has killed Aziz Fekkesh, an Egyptian contact whose body has been found in one of the pyramids. The real killer was Jaws.
However, they become formally introduced to one another in Cairo when they both arrive at Max Kalba's club. After spouting various biographical details to each other (for example, Anya is aware of Bond's doomed marriage), they attempt to outbid one another for a secret microfilm. When Kalba is killed by Jaws, they travel across Egypt tracking the microfilm. After Anya ultimately outwits Bond for the microfilm (but Bond had reviewed it), they report to the Abu Simbel temple where Gogol and M have decided to work together to find out how and why their submarines are being stolen while at sea.
For most of the film, Bond and Anya have the same mission objectives and try to achieve the same goals often by attempting to outdo one another, during which they fall in love. While travelling to Sardinia by train they share a meal together and while Anya is preparing for bed in her carriage, having politely declined Bond's offer of a nightcap, she is attacked by Jaws. Bond hears the sounds of a struggle over the noise of the train and arrives just in time to save her from being killed. After a brief fight, Jaws is dispatched out of a window and Bond returns to Anya, who tends to a cut on his shoulder before they kiss and ultimately spend the night together. On Sardinia, Anya accompanies Bond to meet Karl Stromberg posing as his wife. Afterwards, Anya learns that Bond killed her lover. She then tells him that she will ultimately have revenge once their mission is complete.
Anya is later captured by Stromberg and held captive at Atlantis, Stromberg's undersea base. Bond sneaks aboard and rescues her. As the mission reaches its end, she points her gun at Bond, only to discover that she is too in love with him to kill him.
Anya (pointing gun at Bond), tells him: ""The mission is over, Commander"". At that moment, as Anya is tightening her finger on the trigger, the cork pops off of a champagne bottle that Bond is in the process of opening. Anya smiles, stifling a giggle, and Bond says ""In my country, Major, the condemned man is usually allowed a final request"" to which she says ""Granted"". Bond then suggests that they get out of their wet clothes.
When James and Anya's escape pod goes into the ship Bond saved from Stromberg's 'instruments of Armageddon', Q, M, Fredrick Gray and Anya's superiors from Russia look inside the window at James and Anya making love in the luxury bed in awe. ""James!"" Anya says as she's the first one in the pod to see the duo's superiors.
Anya was depicted as cunning, devious, aloof and fearless. She was vengeful and became tenacious to kill James Bond after he killed her boyfriend. However, despite this, unfortunately for Sergei, she is also capable of forgiveness and letting go of these grudges as she has shown to have forgiven Bond after she realized Bond actually killed Sergei in self-defense. She is shown to have nerves of steel, since she was completely calm in holding Jaws at gunpoint.
It was planned to have Amasova make a cameo in Moonraker (which was released in 1979), as the woman in bed with General Gogol, but this never happened.

1261,/wiki/Braun_(Guy_De_Saint_Cyr),"HenchmanBraun was a fictional enforcer and one of the Sanchez Cartel's three main henchmen alongside Dario and Perez; serving as the silent muscle of the three. The character appeared in the 1989 James Bond film Licence to Kill, portrayed by actor Guy De Saint Cyr, and was fleshed out in John Gardner's accompanying novelization.
As James Bond and Pam Bouvier are secretly sabotaging Sanchez's operation and framing other subordinates of his with treachery, Sanchez's men find money stolen by Bond in Milton Krest's decompression chamber, leading to Sanchez suspecting Krest's betrayal. Braun serves as witnesses to Krest's execution afterwards. He is also present at Sanchez's chemical plant where the cocaine they trafficked was to be ground up and mixed into gasoline for transport via gasoline trucks. After Bond's sabotage and destruction of the facility, Braun executes another of Sanchez's henchmen, Colonel Heller, due to his attempting to escape with Sanchez's stinger missiles, and brings up the rear of the convoy of tanker trucks in his own personal pickup truck.
Braun catches up to the convoy and, with Perez riding shotgun and the other thugs riding in the back, drives after Bond. Braun shows off his recklessness by driving through a wall of flame from a destroyed tanker, causing the henchmen riding in the back to jump out to safety and setting his tires on fire. Seeing Bond hanging onto the back of a tanker Perez attempts to shoot at him, but the agent opens a gas valve in the tanker and dumps a long trail of spilled gasoline on the road. The already burning tires of Braun's pickup truck suddenly combust from the spilled gasoline, causing Braun to lose control of the truck. The burning truck careens off the road, barely missing Pam Bouvier's plane, and tumbles into the air ensuring him a ghastly demise.

The Turbo is a turbocharged variant of the original Bentley Mulsanne (released in 1980) and was featured in the two James Bond novels Role of Honour and Nobody Lives Forever by John Gardner.
The Mulsanne Turbo was launched at the Geneva Motor Show in 1982 and produced until 1985. The Mulsanne shared the traditional 6.75 L (6750 cc/411 in³) Rolls-Royce V8 with aluminium alloy cylinder heads. All Mulsannes use a 3-speed automatic transmission. There was a 50% increase in power thanks to the Garrett AiResearch turbocharger. There was the usual highly polished walnut veneered fascia, blemish-free leather and carpets and headlining of pure wool for the interior. 498 short wheelbase and 18 long wheelbase Mulsanne Turbos were built
Bond purchases a Mulsanne Turbo in John Gardner's 1984 James Bond novel Role of Honour. The car is British racing green with a magnolia interior. Likewise with the Silver Beast, Bond had CCS outfit the car with a long-range telephone and a hidden weapon compartment. Bentley had apparently requested that Gardner not outfit the car with any gadgets other than the telephone.

1263,/wiki/Beckett_Hawkwood,"In the mid-2010s, Eidolon was compromised by a series of financial slip-ups - prompting Hawkwood to murder the accountant responsible. An MI6 number cruncher named Cadence Birdwhistle happened across the suspicious money transfers and became a target of the network. After a pair of botched assassination attempts in the United States, Hawkwood intercepted the accountant and her MI6 protector, James Bond, at Heathrow Airport in London. The attack was a failure and their distinctive choice of weapons further incriminated MI5. Birdwhistle's intelligence resulted in 007 successfully raiding the organisation's UK arms stockpile at Box Tunnel. Hawkwood narrowly evaded the spy and was dispatched to attack a joint intelligence services meeting by his Eidolon superior and MI5 chief, Sir Stephen Mackmain.
After the coup spectacularly failed, Hawkwood - now the sole remaining member of Eidolon's UK cell - travelled to Westminster with a lorry carrying a thermobaric weapon. His recognition by Birdwhistle put the area in lockdown and forced Hawkwood to instead target the SIS Building at Vauxhall Cross. James Bond intercepted him en route and, after colliding with the truck, forced him to abandon the vehicle. The pair brawled; culminating with 007 stabbing him between the ribs. Realizing that he had no chance of escape from the authorities, and wanting to die with honour, he was persuaded by Bond to slit his own throat.

The character served as an antagonist in John Pearson's 1973 continuation novel, James Bond: The Authorised Biography.
Born to a German father and a Belgian mother, Grautz worked with the Vichy secret police, and for the Gestapo during the Second World War. He was involved in the torture of suspects, murder of hostages and alleged involvement in mass executions at Nantes in 1943. Following the end of the war he was employed as a mercenary by former British spymaster, Maddox. Circa 1950, operating under the alias ""Descaux"", Grautz was tasked with assassinating another of Maddox's employees - James Bond. Bond's friendship with- and unreciprocated love for- Maddox's wife prompted the vengeful husband to plot his humiliating demise by framing him for the murder of a moderate Algerian nationalist named El Bezir. After rigging Grautz's gelignite bomb to detonate, Bond allowed himself to be caught and tortured - eliciting a gloating confession of Maddox's guilt from the racist henchman. As Grautz departed to kill El Bezir, the bomb exploded in his Citroën - killing him and foiling the plot.

1265,/wiki/Double_or_Die,"Double or Die is the third novel in the Young Bond series depicting Ian Fleming's superspy James Bond as a teenager in the 1930s. The novel, written by Charlie Higson, was released in the UK in January, 2007 by Puffin Books.
While visiting Highgate Cemetery, Professor Alexis Fairburn, a professor at Eton College, was kidnapped by two thugs for his knowledge of ""Project Nemesis"", but he dropped a clue on his way out of the cemetery. At the Duck Inn in Pett Bottom, James Bond was contacted by his headmaster, who informed him of the cover story for the events of Blood Fever, and told James to stay out of trouble and never to speak of what had happened to him.
Months into the school year, James was again contacted by the Headmaster regarding the disappearance of their maths professor, Alexis Fairburn. Fairburn had sent a vague notice of resignation, and a letter to Bond's messmate Pritpal Nandra, which they hoped might help them understand the situation. Pritpal read the cryptic letter, but could make nothing of it. The Headmaster then took it to his office, but by remembering a phrase from the letter, the boys realized that it was a puzzle with their first hint being from the morning crossword, which had been set by Fairburn, ""Solve Seven Cryptic Clues"". Bond then arranged with the school Danger Society to make a copy of the letter by spying on the Headmaster from the glass roof of his study. They then worked through two more clues and deduced that a man by the name of Gordius, an alieus used by the morning crossword setter that had replaced Fairburn.
Gordius agreed to come to the school crossword society meeting, but the man that came was less interested in crosswords than in the letter left by Fairburn. He challenged James and two other boys to a card game called Hearts, which James was able to win, much to Gordius' dismay. Before they parted company, James asked for Gordius' name, and after some thought he replied with Ivar Peterson. With this information, James began to plan a meeting with the real Professor Ivar Peterson at Cambridge. When James and Pritpal returned to Eton they were nearly run over by a skull faced man, and found that their house had had a fire after a break in, the perpetrator of which, the housekeeper swore was death itself. The boys were then transferred to Eton Mission, a church in Cambridge until the house was repaired. In Cambridge, James went to see Petersen, and waited outside of his study with a young Alan Turing. When Bond entered the study, he found Petersen murdered at his writing desk. Deducing that the murderer was in the next room, James took the letter Petersen had been writing, a paper with binary code on it, and a photograph of Fairburn, Peterson, and a third man.
Outside, James ran into Turing, whom he told to take the police to Petersen's room, but he spotted the skull faced man who had nearly run him down, and ran away. He went to the tea shop where he had arranged to meet Perry Mandeville who had driven to Cambridge with him, but Mandeville was not there. After reading the letter from Petersen, James went to his car, where he was cornered by the skull faced man and his colleague. James sped away in his car, but his pursuers did not give up. They chased him through the surrounding countryside, and James made several escape attempts to escape but to no avail. After one final attempt, by speeding past a truck that the gangsters' car could not get past. Shortly up the road however, James discovered that they were now in front of him, and fearing he had gone mad, James decided to ram them. As he got closer, the gangsters veered off the road, but shortly after, James' car hit an ice puddle which sent it skidding through the stonework of the bridge that it led to, throwing James out of the car and onto the riverbank. As he got up to observe his car it exploded, sending James tumbling back into the river. The gangsters, named Wolfgang and Ludwig Smith came down to investigate, but the flaming car's spark plug exploded and took out one of Wolfgang's ears, necessitating them to make a speedy escape. James then awoke under the bridge and began an aimless walk across the countryside. He awoke in a hospital in London, which he quickly escaped to avoid speaking to police, and got a cab to Perry Mandeville's house in Regent's Park, where they decide to track down Sir John Charnage, who was mentioned in the letter from Peterson. When they arrived at Charnage's house, they discovered that he was the man who had masqueraded as Peterson at the Crossword Club, and he tried to call the police on them, but they escaped into the street and back to Eton Mission after learning that they both were looking for Fairburn.
In their room, James and Perry deciphered the binary code with the help of Pritpal Nandra, and learned that Fairburn had been working on a Project Nemesis. They were then visited by police, who were turned away when they learned that there were no students at the Mission with James and Perry's cover names. They then decided that they must meet the deadline in the letters by acting themselves and James and Perry headed to find Egyptian tombs at Highgate Cemetery that were mentioned. When they arrived, they enlisted the aid of a tramp named Theo who led them to Nero: a statue of a lion on a ringmaster's grave where Fairburn had hidden an important letter. They then were discovered by the Smiths, whom James tricked into taking the binary code instead of the letter they wanted, and escaped with help from Theo, who was killed in the struggle. Perry and James were separated, and James got into the boot of the Smiths' car, which he believed would take him to Fairburn. They arrived at the Charnage Chemical Foundry, where James set fire to their car in order to infiltrate the factory, win which he discovered the Paradice Casino. On his way out, he briefly helped a man named Dutch Flegenheimer win back his losses before Ludwig Smith took him away to Charnage's office, where he was questioned and tortured by having lethal amounts of Gin forced down his throat as he eventually shared what he knew with Charnage to make it stop. During the torture session, James managed to solve another clue, and deduced that Charnage was working for the Russians.
James was then deemed too dangerous to be kept alive and was taken by the Smiths to the Thames to be dumped into the river. James, using a bottle of unstable potassium he had stolen from the Charnage Chemical Foundry, and set the boat on fire, causing Wolfgang to lose all of the fingers on his left hand, and he escaped in the turmoil. He was found asleep in a back alley by Kelly Kelly and her gang of street urchins, and was kept from mutilation by her elder brother Red Kelly. After telling them his story and resting at the Kelly house, James called Mandeville and Nandra, who had solved another clue and returned to Eton to see a wall painting of Sir Amoras attempting to sell his wife to the Devil, which reflected the situation of John Charnage and Colonel Irina Sedova. On learning from Red's father that there was a ship at the King George V port called the Amoras, and Kelly's reasoning that Project Nemesis would be transported by boat, the Kellys took James through the sewers to the abandoned pneumatic rail system, and Kelly and James sneaked to the docks.
They used a rowboat to get alongside the Amoras, and sneak aboard. James finds the Nemesis Device, and later finds Fairburn, whom he safely gets off the ship, but when they get back to the rowboat, they Amoras crew had noticed Fairburn's disappearance, and the three spent the night in a scrapped ocean liner next to the Amoras. In the morning they had been discovered, but fought their way to the wharf where the sailors of the Amoras were waiting for them. They prepared to surrender, but Perry Mandeville and Red Kelly had assembled a small army and they fought them off. James then decided to re-board the Amoras with Red and a few others to destroy the Nemesis machine. On board, Ludwig and Wolfgang attempted to kill James, but were both killed in gruesome ways. After Nemesis was safely destroyed, Kelly revealed to Bond that Sedova, the mastermind behind the plot to steal the Nemesis, had taken Fairburn and Mandeville through the pneumatic rail system. He and the Kellys then trailed her through the tunnels and found Perry, who helped James to get Fairburn back, but James was knocked into a fan. He landed on a narrow walkway over it, and allowed Sedova to go free.
Thirteen years later, at age 25, James drove to Site X, where decoding during the recently ended war had happened. There he ran into Alan Turing again, and met up with Fairburn, who had been on the coding team. The two ended their reunion with a discussion of how wars would be fought by machines in the near future, and James remarking that ""I suppose I'm doomed to spend the rest of my life trying to sort out the problems that the clever people of the world make for the rest of us"".

1272,/wiki/BMW_750iL,"The BMW 750iL is a member of the the E38 generation (1994–2001) by that time, the 7 series was in it's third generation. The 750iL was essentially a long-wheelbase 750i (the ""L"" is from the German word for long, ""lang""). In America, the model was sold as the 750iL; there was no E38 750i in the US lineup. The 750i (and iL) came with a 5.4 L V12 346 hp (258 kW; 351 PS) engine, as was used in the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph. Both variants had a five-speed automatic gearbox.
Features of the BMW 750iL included high-pressure headlight washers, auto-levelling xenon HID headlamps (The E38 was the first car in the world to feature Xenon headlights), power moonroof, a sound system with 14 speakers and four subwoofers as well as 6-disc CD changer and rain-sensing wipers. BMW was also the first European car manufacturer to offer an integrated satellite navigation screen which featured on the E38 7 Series. The E38 was also the first generation of 7 series to be available with the option of a diesel, was the first BMW to have televisions fitted , the first to have a five speed automatic gearbox and the first car ever to be fitted with curtain airbags.
Other features included an automatic climate control system with separate controls for the driver and passenger, a three-position memory system for the driver’s seat, safety-belt height, new steering wheel and outside mirrors. Front-seat side airbags and a Head Protection System (HPS) were also standard. The 750iL featured an all-leather interior with burl walnut trim. The continuous-motion Active Comfort Seat technology was introduced in 1998 to improve comfort and reduce fatigue for the driver and front passenger.
The BMW 750iL was Bond's provided vehicle for the 18th James Bond feature film Tomorrow Never Dies (1997). Used during sequences set in Germany, the car came equipped with a security system that sprayed tear gas and delivered electric shocks to intruders. The vehicle also came equipped with a fingerprint-protected safe hidden behind the passenger airbag compartment. The 750iL could be controlled remotely via Bond's Ericsson cell phone, which flipped open to reveal an LCD display and trackpad. Defense mechanisms included a roof-mounted rocket launcher, self-sealing and re-inflating tyres, a cable cutting device in the front bonnet emblem and a caltrop dispenser under the rear bumper.
During a chase sequence in the Atlantic Hotel parking garage, its windshield (despite able to withstand sledgehammer blows) and rear window are shot out by a combination of grenades and assault rifle gunfire from Elliot Carver's henchmen who were at the wheel of two Mercedes S Classes, an Opel Senator Mk2 and a Ford Scorpio Mk1. Bond eventually eludes the thugs and drives the 750iL off the roof of the garage via remote control. The car ironically ends up crashing into an Avis car rental store at street level. In a deleted scene, while leaving Bond made the excuse ""Left the keys in the car"" to the civilians.
Seventeen vehicles were used during filming of the German scenes. Four were adapted to be 'hidden driver' cars, in which a concealed driver would sit in the back using a small steering wheel. Video monitors were attached to cameras hidden in the wing mirrors and on top of the windscreen. Three more BMW's were used as backup for the hidden drivers. One car was equipped with the sliding glove compartment revealing a safe and only used for this one scene. Another, dubbed the 'cannon', was specially prepared to be propelled off the roof in the car chase's climax. It was stripped off as much weight as possible in order to be fired from a special rig. The remaining seven 'pristine' cars were used only for back-up and exterior shots, including one that was being kept in Hamburg for shooting there.

1273,/wiki/Grunther_(Yuri_Borienko),"Grunther was the fictional head of security of Ernst Stavro Blofeld's clinical allergy-research institute atop Piz Gloria in the Swiss Alps. A major antagonist portrayed by Russian wrestler and actor, Yuri Borienko, the character appeared in the 1969 James Bond film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
After arriving at Piz Gloria, Grunther discreetly examines Bond's luggage before taking him to his room. Bunt explains that Grunther will open his externally locked door and escort him if he needs to leave his suite. This 'complicated arrangement' is in place for all Blofeld's guests; supposedly to prevent them from disturbing one another. Consequently, Bond is under his constant supervision during his stay at the clinic.
The following morning he is seen forcefully denying Bond's Swiss contact, Shaun Campbell access to the Piz Gloria clinic as the man attempts to use the cable car, shouting him out the door and closing it after him. Campbell subsequently tries to scale the mountain face, but is caught by Grunther and his security team while Bond is curling with the other guests. He is escorted back down via cable car and, unbeknownst to Bond, killed with an undisclosed method. 
Later that evening, Bond lets himself into one of the patients' rooms as he had been doing throughout his stay, only to be greeted by Frauleïn Bunt, hiding in the guest's bed, and Grunther, who knocks him unconscious with a blow to the back of the head. Aware of his identity, Blofeld and Grunther escort 007 to be locked in the room where the cable car's mechanical components are installed. On the way, Blofeld takes the opportunity to point out Campbell's corpse hanging from the rockface outside. Bond tries to attack him, but is restrained by Grunther and another guard.
Bond quickly escapes from the cable car room and takes to the slopes on a stolen pair of skis. His escape doesn't go unnoticed and Grunther frantically alerts Blofeld by phone. Taking a team of men with him, he pursues Bond down the mountain before losing control and crashing into a tree. Bond temporarily evades his pursuers and reunites with his fiancée, Tracy, in a nearby village before being relocated by Blofeld and Grunther the following day. The chase resumes across the road, through Lauterbrunnen again and then the alps, concluding with Blofeld launching a flair and causing an avalanche which buries 007 and Tracy.
Assuming Bond to be dead, Grunther is dispatched to take the incapacitated Tracy back to Piz Gloria. However, Bond survives the incident and returns to London. The next day, he returns and assaults the clinic with the help of Tracy's father, Marc-Ange Draco. Grunther alerts Blofeld to Draco's incoming helicopters, only to have the mastermind dismiss the warning, thinking they are harmless delivery choppers. As chaos ensues, Grunther is ordered by Blofeld to deal with Tracy with another guard. The two fight hand-to-hand, with the girl wielding a broken bottle and the guard holding a cudgel. Tracy manages to knock him down the stairs through a wall or ornamental rings and he is ultimately killed when she throws him against a set of decorative wall spikes, stabbing him through the back.
In his role as a stuntman, Yuri Borienko was one of the people who assisted in the auditioning of George Lazenby for the part of James Bond. In 1968, Lazenby was required to 'fight' Borienko as part of his screen test at Pinewood Studios. During this, Lazenby punched the wrestler unexpectedly and broke his nose on accident.

The car has been used by several royal households, and is used for weddings, funerals, government officials or as a limousine operated by hotels.
The Living Daylights shows M leaving Blayden House for London in a black Daimler Limousine, which was built in 1986. The square indicators and chrome bumpers indicate a 1979-1986 model, but the licence plate C31DHV was issued in 1986.
M also uses a Daimler Limousine in Tomorrow Never Dies, when leaving the Ministry of Defence. The Daimler races through the streets of London, as a motorcycle escort provided by City of London Police clears the way. Other passengers on the Daimler, which is a 1987-1992 model (due to rubber bumpers), are James Bond, Charles Robinson and Miss Moneypenny.
The car later re-appears when M visits the Ministry of Defence again.

1275,/wiki/BMW_Z8,"The $128,000 car had an all aluminum chassis and body and used a 4.9 L (4941 cc) 32-valve V8, that developed 400 hp (300 kW) and 500 N·m (370 ft·lbf) torque. This engine, known internally as the S62, was built by the BMW Motorsport subsidiary and was shared with the E39 M5. The engine was located behind the front axle in order to provide the car with 50/50 weight distribution. The factory claimed a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) time of 4.7 seconds; Motor Trend magazine achieved 0–96 km/h (0–60 mph) in 4.2 seconds. Road and Track measured the car's lateral grip at .92. Car and Driver magazine also tested the car and found that it outperformed the contemporary benchmark Ferrari 360 Modena in three important performance categories: acceleration, handling, and braking. As with most BMW products, its top speed was electronically limited to 155.4 mph (250 km/h); the car's maximum top speed with an unlocked chip was 170 mph (270 km/h).
The Z8 included an innovative use of neon exterior lighting. The tail lights and turn indicators are powered by neon tubes that offer quicker activation than standard lightbulbs and are expected to last for the life of the vehicle.                     
Every Z8 was shipped with a color-matching metal hardtop with rear defroster. Unlike many accessory hardtops, which are provided for practical rather than stylistic considerations, the Z8 hardtop was designed from the outset to complement the lines of the roadster.
In order to keep the interior uncluttered, a number of convenience functions were integrated into multifunction controls. For example, the power windows and mirrors were controlled by a single instrument. Also, the center-mounted instrument cluster was canted slightly toward the driver. The displacement of these gauges to the middle of the dash was intended to offer an unimpeded view of the hood and the road ahead.
The car was featured in the 1999 film The World Is Not Enough and in the games James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire and 007 Racing. In the film, it was driven by Bond until being sliced in half by a helicopter equipped with tree-cutting saws in Azerbaijan. So far in the film series, this marks the only occasion when Bond has expressed concern about Q being upset with James wreaking havoc on cars and equipment. Ironically, this takes place after Desmond Llewelyn makes his final appearance on the screen as Q. The actual number plate of the car V354 FMP was never registered on the Bond vehicle, but has since been registered to another BMW Z8 in the UK.
In 007 Racing, players drive the BMW Z8 through one of the last levels of New York when Bond begins downloading files from four limousines.
In the video game Agent Under Fire, players drive the car through the level of Hong Kong in a car chase with Carla the Jackal, though she was not driving the car with the vials but instead it was an armored car. The vehicle isn't seen after the level.
The car also appears in the James Bond's DLC of Forza Horizon 4 : Best of Bond Car.

1276,/wiki/Comic_books,"James Bond's success after the start of the film franchise in 1962 spawned a number of comic books around the world. Initially, these were adaptations of various movies. In the late 1980s and continuing through to the mid-1990s, however, a series of original stories were also published.
In 1957 the Daily Express, a newspaper owned by Lord Beaverbrook, approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips. Ian Fleming at the time was reluctant to allow this because he felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing and could potentially hurt his series while he was still authoring them. Regardless, Fleming later agreed and the first strip Casino Royale was published in 1958. Starting in 1958 and continuing to 1983, 007 appeared in 52 comic strips that were syndicated in British newspapers, 7 of which were published abroad. Writers included Anthony Hern, Henry Gammidge, Peter O'Donnell and Jim Lawrence and the series was illustrated initially by John McLusky and later Yaroslav Horak.

The first James Bond comic book appeared in 1963 - an adaptation of the first Bond film Dr. No, written and illustrated by Norman J. Nodel. Originally published by Classics Illustrated in the United Kingdom, it was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its Showcase anthology series.
The next James Bond comic book didn't appear for nearly 20 years, when Marvel Comics published a two-issue adaptation of the 1981 film For Your Eyes Only (which was also published in a single-issue magazine edition and a paperback release). Marvel later adapted the 1983 film Octopussy in magazine format.
In 1989 comic books featuring Bond began to appear on a semi-regular basis for a few years, starting with an adaptation of Licence to Kill published in 1989 by Eclipse Comics and illustrated by Mike Grell, which was published in both trade paperback and hardcover edition. Grell would go on to write the miniseries Permission to Die, the first James Bond comic book storyline not adapted from a previous work, which was published over a two-year period by Eclipse.
In 1992, Dark Horse Comics obtained the rights to produce James Bond comics and issued a number of miniseries and standalone stories, starting with Serpent's Tooth, up until 1995. One of these miniseries, A Silent Armageddon, was never completed.
Between 1965 and 1996 Swedish publisher by Semic Press produced the James Bond, Agent 007 comic book, which made extensive use of translated content licensed from the James Bond Daily Express newspaper strip, along with over forty original tales, movie tie-in comics, and several translated Dark Horse Comics.

1277,/wiki/Bentley_4%C2%BD_Litre,"The 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race is a 24 hour race around the Circuit de la Sarthe. The inaugural race was held May 26–27, 1923. In 1924 Canadian John Duff won the competition in his personal car, a Bentley 3 Litre.A win which would bring much attention to Bentley's vehicles.
In the novels, no gadgets were installed as this was Bond's personal vehicle that in Casino Royale is mentioned as being a hobby that Bond enjoys working on. Its only armament is a high-powered revolver Bond keeps in the glove compartment. The Bentley 4½ Litre was destroyed during a chase sequence in Moonraker.

1278,/wiki/Blessing_Belem,"Aleesha Blessing Belem, alias Efua Blessing Ogilvy-Grant is a Central Intelligence Agency operative sent to Zanzarim early in her career on account of a brewing Civil War in the country. She debuted in the 2013 James Bond Novel Solo by William Boyd.
Blessing was born to at least one Lowele tribe parent in Zanzarim.
At some point she attended Harvard and began working for the CIA.
She was soon assigned to spy on the British Zanzarim Station as the Station Chief's secretary with orders to accompany James Bond to the Democratic Republic of Dahum in order to offer asylum to brigadier Solomon Adeka.
After duping station chief Ed Ogilvy-Grant into thinking he would arrive a week later, Blessing posed as Efua Ogilvy-Grant and briefed Agent James Bond, 007. After a brief conversation, they left for dinner at El Kebab, the only real restaurant in town. Afterwards they headed for a crowded bar to discuss Bond's entry into Dahum. She had arranged to drive most of the way, and had contacted a fisherman to take him the rest of the way by boat. They were then interrupted by a drunk man who mistook Blessing for a prostitute. Bond took him out back and knocked him out: a deed which Blessing felt was unnecessary, but she was grateful for.
The next day, Blessing set to painting the word ""Press"" on a beige Austin 1100 for their journey, and they commenced south, switching drivers every now and then. Unfortunately, they were eventually stopped at a military roadblock, and despite Blessing's best efforts to negotiate a way through, they turned around to not be kept waiting behind the other cars. On the second day they reached the town where they were to part ways, and Blessing met with the fisherman Kojo, who would take Bond into Dahum. That night however, Blessing noticed a Gecko on her ceiling, and having a phobia of lizards, she asked Bond to remove it. He did, and their tender moment turned into a night of lovemaking.
Unfortunately, they were kidnapped by Dahumian soldiers that had mistaken Bond for an English mercenary. Blessing was interrogated in a small tent in the jungle by their leader Jakobus Breed before she and Bond escaped from the rebels when they were attacked by the Zanza Force while trying to cross a road back into Dahum territory. James tried to keep Blessing hidden in the firefight, but Blessing was too afraid and claimed that she would not die in the jungle and ran away.
She managed to hide and survive the fight before wandering the jungle for days and stumbling on a convent where she was nursed to health before setting out for Port Dunbar where she found that Adeka had died. In order to get close to Hulbert Linck, she partnered with a mercenary called Kobus Breed, and on the day Zanza Force reached the city, she had to shoot Bond to prove her loyalty, but did not give a killing blow.
They escaped to Washington DC, where they worked for the charity AfricaKIN until she saw Bond in a restaraunt and alerted the CIA.
Rhe two met up in her hotel room and made love after discussing their mission and Blessing's allegiance. Unfortunately, they were seen by Breed, who would soon break in, slit Blessing's throat, and hang her up in the gotel bathroom with a giant fishhook through her jaw.

1280,/wiki/00_agent,"The 00 Section of MI6 is considered the secret service's elite. A 00 (typically read ""Double O"" and denoted in Fleming's novels by the letters ""OO"" rather than the digits ""00"") is a field agent that holds a licence to kill in the field, at their discretion, to complete any mission. Standard mandatory retirement age is 45 though various writers including Ian Fleming, Sebastian Faulks and John Gardner have contradicted this as a matter of Poetic License and several actors who have portrayed Bond on film have been older than 45 at the time of playing the character. Although Fleming only mentioned five 00 agents, others have been added over the years across various franchise media.
The following list is of the known members of this elite order who have been referenced in officially licenced James Bond fiction: novels, films, video games, and comic strips (not including impostors).

1281,/wiki/Anton_Murik,"Dr. Anton Angus Murik, Laird of Murcaldy, also known by the cryptonym ""Warlock"", was a fictional nuclear physicist, entrepreneur, and Scottish landowner. The character served as the primary antagonist of John Gardner's 1981 James Bond continuation novel, Licence Renewed.
For many years, the Murik family had been regarded as a noble line. In 1890, the present Laird's grandfather, Angus Murik, went on an adventure to find his disinherited brother who had left out for some offense. After being missing for three months in central Europe, he returned with a pregnant foreign woman, though reported documents suggest it was not Angus who had returned, but his brother, Hamish. The child eventually became Anton's father, supposedly born out of wedlock since no reports of marriage were recorded.
Anton Angus Murik was born on December 18, 1920. That same year, his father, an adventurer since the age of eighteen, had been killed in Sicily, Italy by bandits. His ""mother"" returned to the Murik Castle, though newspapers reported that the Laird and his wife had been both killed. She later clarified that it was actually her maid who died in the attacks. Shortly after, she gave birth to a son, whom had been baptized as Anton Angus and took the title, Laird of Murcaldy. People within the Murik estate question the circumstances and eligibility of Anton's right to the title.
Murik was educated at Harrow and St. John's College in Cambridge where he received First Class Honours in Physics followed by a Fellowship and a Doctorate. He eventually worked under Professor Lindemann, scientific advisor to Winston Churchill, and worked on the Manhattan Project and the Committee for the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy. Under the membership of the International Atomic Energy Commission, Murik proposed the Murik Ultra-Safe Reactor, which would provide nuclear power and safely dispose of the waste. However, the committee disapproved of the reactor citing flaws within the design; Murik requested more funding for the project and to build his own reactor, which the committee refused to lend.
While briefing James Bond of Murik's actions, M theorizes Murik became affilicated with assassin Franco Quesocriado, and are both supposedly creating a lethal nuclear device. Since Murcaldy is outside of MI6's jurisdictions, the Director-General of MI5, Richard Duggan requests that M send Bond to survey Murik. Relying on information that MI5 did not have, M changes Bond's assignment to instead infiltrate Murik's Scottish castle and gain Murik's confidence. Upon arriving in Murcaldy, Scotland, Bond arranges a coincidental meeting with Murik at the Ascot Racecourse. There, Murik wins the Ascot Gold Cup with his horse, China Blue. Under the identity of a mercenary-for-hire, Murik invites Bond to his castle to participate in the Highland Games at his castle.
That same night, Bond, spying on the castle with equipment from Q'ute, is ambushed by Caber, Murik's personal bodyguard. Mary Jane Mashkin notices Bond, and has him enter the castle. After having dinner, Bond listens on a conservation between Murik and Franco discussing their plans through a countersurveillance receiver through a bug in Murik's study room. The next morning, Bond participates in the Highland Games, where he defeats Caber. Further receiving Murik's confidence, Murik then assigns Bond to kill Franco for a sum of £50,000.
Upon capturing Bond after a violent car chase resulting in two deaths of Murik's men, Murik has Mashkin administer several hypodermic drug doses in hopes Bond will reveal his true identity. When this fails, Murik transports Bond via Blackhawk aircraft to Perpignan, France, where he escapes him at the airport. At a fashion show in the Palais des rois de Majorque, Bond kills Franco, who accidentally shoots a gelatin capsule at Mary Jane originally aimed for Lavender. Captured again, Bond learns from Murik that the gelatin capsule resulted in a fatal heart attack for Mary Jane, and that Lavender is the true heir of the Laird title. As Murik explains, his mother was his father's maid, and that his half-brother (born of Anton's father and his legal wife) was raised by the Sicilians after the raid. When Anton agreed to surrender Murcaldy to him, his half-brother and his wife, which gave birth to Lavender, suddenly died without seeing the official documents confirming they are legal heirs to the Laird title.
Tying Bond aboard his C-14 Starlifter, Murik (disguising his voice to sound like a woman's) broadcasts his message that unless the governments of Britain, France, West and East Germany, and the United States pay a ransom of $50 billion in cut gem diamonds and give the codeword, six nuclear reactor power plants will be seized by terrorist squads. Bond manages to unleash himself, and knocks out Murik. He calls off the terrorist squads cleverly guessing the codename as ""Lock"", Murick's nickname. After landing the plane, Bond deduces that Murik managed to escape the plane.
Back at Regent's Park, Bond theorizes that Murik is returning to his castle to destroy the documents that validate Lavender as the true Laird. Returning to Murik Castle, Bond and Bill Tanner order an escaping Murik to surrender, but he is shot down with a Gyrojet pistol.

1282,/wiki/Dominic_Greene_(Mathieu_Amalric),"Greene runs an organisation called Greene Planet, which is supposedly devoted to buying up large sums of land for ecological preservation. However, Greene is secretly a member of Quantum, a criminal organization which accrues power and influence through world finance and geopolitics. During the events of the film he is spearheading their Tierra Project in Bolivia.
When showing Camille Montes the body of her informant, he relates the story of how when he was 15, he had a crush on one of his mother’s piano students. He overheard this girl saying mean things about him. Angry, he presumably killed her with an iron.
Greene Planet is a front for his real plan, to control various commodities such as oil and water, the latter having to do with his current plot. Greene plans to control the supply of water in Bolivia, which if successful will put his organization in control of the country's most vital asset. To make the transaction, ""legal,"" Greene approaches the president of Bolivia with an offer - a large sum of money for 60% control of the water. The president refuses, so Greene takes his offer to the exiled dictator of Bolivia, General Medrano. He makes the general an offer to return him to power in exchange for a large region of apparently barren land. Medrano accepts, thinking the barren region to be worthless. It is only after the transaction has been made that Greene reveals his extortionate plans.
Greene's mistress, Camille Montes, has been wanting to see Medrano for a very long time. The general had murdered her family some years previous, and Montes has been looking for him ever since. When she found out that Medrano was in business with Greene, she became involved with the villain, in order to get to Medrano. Greene knows this, and arranges for Montes to be killed. She is saved, however, by James Bond. She confronts Greene, who turns her over to Medrano, asking him to throw her overboard when he's done with her. Medrano takes her on a speedboat to his yacht, but Bond intervenes. Just as she is about to kill Medrano, Bond pulls her into a separate boat. After a long chase, Bond leaves Her on the warf. Bond inadvertently helped Greene's plan by saving Medrano's life.
Greene then moves forward with his plan. He meets with Quantum at a performance of Tosca. When Bond infiltrates the meeting, Greene leaves in a hurry. When Greene gets to his car, a henchman falls out of the sky and onto the car. He has his driver shoot the wounded man, then speeds away from the scene, blaming the man's death on Bond.
He then hosts a party, celebrating the conservation of land in Bolivia. He uses this party as an opportunity to make new deals, one of which is interrupted and terminated by Camille Montes. Greene, furious, takes to a balcony and tries to push her to her death. Bond intervenes, and leaves with Montes. Greene sends his henchman Elvis after them, but he's injured by Strawberry Fields, who trips him and sends him tumbling down a staircase. Greene later has Fields murdered by drowning her in oil.
He then leaves to make his deal with Medrano, and the Colonel Carlos, who earlier had Bond's contact René Mathis killed. He meets with Medrano and Carlos, giving Carlos his money first. When Medrano inquires after his own cash, Greene explains a little side deal. In order for Medrano to get the money to overthrow the government, he has to sign over 60% of all Bolivian water. When Medrano refuses, Greene explains that he had first gone to the current president, and offered him the same deal, and met with the same answer. Medrano reluctantly signs it over, in order to get the money.
Everything seems alright - until 007 breaks in. There's also a nasty little surprise. Bond has killed Carlos, and in doing so set the building on fire. Medrano has already left for his room, which leaves Greene, Bond, and Elvis in the conference room. Greene orders Elvis to kill Bond, but before he can do so, the explosions reach the three opponents. Bond and Greene race for cover, but Elvis is incinerated. In the hallway, Greene attacks Bond with a fire ax. They battle over the flames on a catwalk which eventually collapses. Bond leaps for dry land, but Greene starts to plummet towards the flames. Bond grabs Greene by the hair, saving his life.
Meanwhile, in Medrano's room, Montes and the General battle. While Bond attempts to pull Greene onto firm ground, they hear a shot. Greene laughs, thinking that the general has murdered Montes.
Bond responds by lifting Greene up to the catwalk and rushing away to save Camille. He walks in to find Medrano dead, and Camille attempting to escape from the inferno. They manage to escape, and Bond sees that Greene survived, and is currently trying to escape on foot with a leg injury.
Bond captures Greene, who reveals everything he knows about Quantum. In exchange, Bond doesn't kill him. However, he leaves him in the middle of the desert that Greene had just bought, and gives him a can of motor oil (a reference to Strawberry Fields's death by the hands of his agents), betting that he'll make it twenty miles before he's tempted to drink it. Later, following Yusef Kabira's arrest, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the desert, with two bullets in the base of his skull and motor oil in his stomach; implying his execution by Quantum for leaking information, similarly to how happened to Le Chiffre before him.
An intelligent, ambitious, cunning and manipulative sociopath, Dominic Greene showed a highly opinionated and callous personality. He was quite a social climber, well-respected for his wealth, intellect and so-called ambitions. However, underneath it all, he was a cruel, malicious and arrogant man. He covered his tracks splendidly and knew quite a bit about how the Secret Services of the world work.
He was highly well-connected, and was able to side with the Bolivian chief of police and also General Medrano. Greene was quite cunning and manages to blackmail Medrano into signing over the money that Greene demanded (Double of what they had previously agreed), at the same time showing to Medrano how ruthless Quantum could be and that Medrano, whether he liked it or not, was completely expendable to them.
Dominic Greene was extremely devious and nobody could predict what his next move was going to be. Unfortunately, he had a habit of picking the wrong people to side with: He lost General Medrano to Camille, and beforehand he lost the Bolivian chief of police to James Bond. He was sadistic, taunting Bond when the latter believed Camille to have been killed by General Medrano. This showed him to be quite reckless, as Greene was about to fall to his death when he taunted Bond, who could have easily killed him for that remark. Greene was a coward, and did whatever he could to escape Quantum, and the wrath of James Bond, after he revealed every last secret of his secret organisation.

1283,/wiki/Braun_(Licence_to_Kill),"HenchmanBraun was a fictional enforcer and one of the Sanchez Cartel's three main henchmen alongside Dario and Perez; serving as the silent muscle of the three. The character appeared in the 1989 James Bond film Licence to Kill, portrayed by actor Guy De Saint Cyr, and was fleshed out in John Gardner's accompanying novelization.
As James Bond and Pam Bouvier are secretly sabotaging Sanchez's operation and framing other subordinates of his with treachery, Sanchez's men find money stolen by Bond in Milton Krest's decompression chamber, leading to Sanchez suspecting Krest's betrayal. Braun serves as witnesses to Krest's execution afterwards. He is also present at Sanchez's chemical plant where the cocaine they trafficked was to be ground up and mixed into gasoline for transport via gasoline trucks. After Bond's sabotage and destruction of the facility, Braun executes another of Sanchez's henchmen, Colonel Heller, due to his attempting to escape with Sanchez's stinger missiles, and brings up the rear of the convoy of tanker trucks in his own personal pickup truck.
Braun catches up to the convoy and, with Perez riding shotgun and the other thugs riding in the back, drives after Bond. Braun shows off his recklessness by driving through a wall of flame from a destroyed tanker, causing the henchmen riding in the back to jump out to safety and setting his tires on fire. Seeing Bond hanging onto the back of a tanker Perez attempts to shoot at him, but the agent opens a gas valve in the tanker and dumps a long trail of spilled gasoline on the road. The already burning tires of Braun's pickup truck suddenly combust from the spilled gasoline, causing Braun to lose control of the truck. The burning truck careens off the road, barely missing Pam Bouvier's plane, and tumbles into the air ensuring him a ghastly demise.

After meeting Janus operative Xenia Onatopp in a Monte Carlo casino, Admiral Farrel is lured back to her yacht, the Manticore, for a night of fun. In the next scene the two are having sex. Xenia snogs him passionately and then Onatopp wraps her legs around his chest and proceeds to crush him to death between her thighs. Farrell's last words are ""Xenia, I can't breathe!"" shortly before he dies from lack of oxygen. The following morning, as Onatopp and her accomplice use the man's ID card to steal a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter, James Bond is trying to get information about Onatopp by snooping on the yacht. Bond is momentarily taken aback when he sees a naked man on the yacht who then falls forward. Bond then realizes that is the corpse of Admiral Farrel with rigor mortis having taken place in his body and he still retains a grin from the revelry of the previous night's promiscuity.

A black 1957 Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner Retractable Hardtop was used by the SPECTRE agent Count Lippe when He Chased James Bond who was leaving the Shrublands health spa in his DB5. Approaching from behind, the Count attempts to shoot 007 with a revolver. As Bond prepares the car's defenses, Lippe's vehicle suddenly bursts into flames - shot from behind by the rockets of a masked assassin's motorcycle. As the assassin streaks past, Lippe's vehicle careers out of control and topples into a ditch where it explodes violently. It is revealed that Lippe was killed by Volpe on Blofeld's orders, as punishment for his poor judgement in hiring the greedy Palazzi.
In the film Die Another Day, after escaping from the custody of MI6, James Bond travels to Cuba on the trail of North Korean terrorist, Zao. It is there that he meets with Raoul, a sleeper agent who resides in Havana. Raoul provides Bond with some information on Zao who has travelled to Dr. Alvarez's clinic on the island of Los Organos and loans Bond a brown and cream 1957 Ford Fairlane to travel there.

1290,/wiki/Carlos_Nikolic_(Claudio_Santamaria),"Weapons manufacturerCarlos Nikolic was the assumed identity of a fictional freelance weapons manufacturer and terrorist. A minor antagonist, the character first appeared in the 2006 James Bond film, Casino Royale, portrayed by Italian actor, Claudio Santamaria, and was later seen in the 2008 video-game, 007: Quantum of Solace.
The terrorist financier Le Chiffre uses a Ugandan warlord's money to short-sell stock in Skyfleet, a promising aerospace company, thus betting the money on the company's failure. After his original bomb-maker is killed by James Bond in Madagascar, Carlos is hired to destroy the company's Skyfleet S570 prototype.
After 007 has killed his boss Alex Dimitrios, the spy notices that the ticket has disappeared and that the bag that was stored in the cloakroom under that ticket has gone. Running outside to be confronted by the mass of people, Bond uses quick thinking to call the person using Dimitrios' phone, since he had sent a text to him already. After identifying the target, Bond follows Carlos to Miami International airport.
At the airport, Bond follows the terrorist who changes into a police uniform. He enters a restricted area just before Bond can stop the entry door from closing. Thinking about it for a few moments, Bond gets an idea that the text sent to Mollaka might spell out the numbers to use on the keypad. Luckily, Bond's guess is right and he makes a hurried pursuit.
In order to distract security staff and remain unchallenged, Carlos activates the sprinkler system as a diversion, and walks out onto the runway. He commandeers a fuel truck and before heading off towards the Skyfleet S570prototype, attaches a small keyring bomb to the underside of the tanker. Bond pursues Carlos on foot, managing to run up some aircraft stairs and jumps on top of the tanker. Carlos tries to dislodge Bond by running the tanker into all sorts of aircraft vehicles, while he tries to get Carlos out of the cabin. As the tanker approaches the Skyfleet S570 prototype, Carlos jumps from the tanker leaving Bond to stop the tanker just before it hits the plane. After Bond is arrested by police, Carlos smugly activates his bomb's detonator. During the fight however, Bond had managed to remove the bomb from the tanker, placing it on Carlos' belt. He realises this too late when he is killed in the resulting explosion.
During the course of the 2008 video-game 007: Quantum of Solace, Bond opens up to Camille Montes about the death of his former love, recounting the events of Casino Royale. The player follows through the plot of Casino Royale, with Bond infiltrating the Science Center to kill Dimitrios and eventually saving Skyfleet from Carlos and an army of terrorists who have hijacked Miami International Airport. The level concludes with a pitched battle inside the S570's hangar. In an introductory cut-scene the character is identified as Carlos Decameron, an unemployed American electrical engineer and a suspected arsonist and weapons manufacturer.
Listed in the film's credits as simply 'Carlos', the character's (presumably fake) surname is 'Nikolic' according to his police uniform ID tag. The name may be an in-joke reference to set dressing department coordinator Marija Nikolic who notably worked in Casino Royale's Costume and Wardrobe Department.

1293,/wiki/Domino_(Claudine_Auger),"James BondJames Bond first heard about Domino during a briefing from M to all the double-0 agents in Europe. Bond had recognized her brother from a photograph, having seen him dead the night before at the Shrublands health clinic, and requests that he be allowed to investigate this potential lead as opposed to his original assignment.
Domino is seen when Bond is swimming in Nassau. Her foot gets stuck in a form of ocean floor, but Bond sets her free. She swims up to her boat and thanks Bond. Bond swims back to his boat with his Nassau contact, Paula Caplan. Paula takes care of their boat as Bond is about to learn more about Domino. Domino and Bond have lunch on the beach. But Quist spies on the two. A sign that Domino had to go back to the Disco Volante.
At the hotel Bond stayed in, Bond sees Domino with Largo. Domino was smoking a cigar as Bond bid in the game against Largo. Domino tells Largo that Bond pressed her to a drink. Domino and Bond slow-dance outside, but Largo collects her. At Largo's home, Palmyra, Domino is swimming when Bond visits. She leaves Bond with Largo to go make lunch. Largo invites Bond to the Nassau Junkanoo.
After being released by a repentant Kutze, she proceeds up to the ship's bridge to find Largo holding Bond at gunpoint. As he prepares to pull the trigger, Domino shoots him in the back with a harpoon. He turns and collapses dead on the ship's wheel, jamming the controls. Unable to move the body and with seconds to spare, Bond, Domino and Kutze leap overboard as the Disco Volante runs aground and explodes violently. The two are subsequently saved by the CIA and are carried off into the air by a sky hook.
Domino Derval was an impeccable French beauty and embodied all that James Bond found irresistible in a woman: She was intelligent, imaginative, humorous, sexually aggressive and courageous. Until she met 007, Domino was resigned to being Emilio Largo's mistress. On the one hand, she got used to the opulent lifestyle Largo offered her. However, on he other hand, she was essentially a prisoner in a golden cage in which he held her captive. Her freedom was limited. It was observed - if not by Largo himself, then his many henchmen. She spent her precious free time alone, went to the beautiful waters of her Nassau passion to swim and lived with Largo in her investment, Palmyra. More than the extravagant attires the frigid Largo offered her, however, Domino desired true love. The wish was fulfilled by her later relationship with James Bond. Domino's deferred courage manifests itself when she risked her life to help Bond to stop Largo's nuclear threat in the United States.

Sedova worked with John Charnage of the U.K. to create a calculating machine for code cracking purposes. Ultimately, Charnage's incompetence led to a boy called James Bond taking the machine's designer Alexis Fairburn being rescued from them. Sedova then had Charnage killed by his own mercenary henchman, Ludwig Smith, and went to take Fairburn back, and ended up with Perry Mandeville as an additional hostage as she and one of her lieutenants dragged Fairburn through London's abandoned Pneumatic Rail System tunnels. She eventually dropped Mandeville after hitting him with her gun, and eventually became aware of Bond's presence. She bade him not to follow her, but he and Mandeville attacked, and sent her associate into a large fan in the tunnel floor, killing him. Bond however, landed on the walkway over the fan, and held a gun at Sedova, who was doing the same to him. She employed distraction tactics to throw him off guard, but he saw through them, but Sedova, knowing he would not pull the trigger, was allowed to walk away.

1297,/wiki/Elliot_Carver_(Jonathan_Pryce),"Elliot Carver was a fictional British media baron who attempted to provoke a war between the United Kingdom and China in order to destroy the Chinese government and use the new government to obtain exclusive broadcasting rights in China. The character was the main antagonist in the 1997 James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies and was portrayed by British actor Jonathan Pryce. Carver also appeared in Raymond Benson's accompanying novelization as well in his 1999 video game adaptation, voiced by Steve Hope Wynne.
Elliot Carver was born in Hong Kong, officially an orphan. He is the illegitimate son of a German woman who died in childbirth and Lord Roverman, a press tycoon. A Chinese family took the boy for a one-time fee of fifty pounds. Thirty years later, Carver confronted and blackmailed Roverman into suicide and took over his media empire.
Elliot Carver went to college in Hong Kong and received a degree in the communication arts. By his own accounts, he had worked for a local newspaper during his adolescence. During his early adulthood, he was hired as a meteorologist at a Hong Kong Television Station and eventually became the station's anchorman. During this time, he often sexually harassed his female coworkers, to the point that one of them fled Hong Kong to get away from him.
In the years since, Carver fashioned himself as a media magnate, utilizing his background in the press and broadcasting. After striking success in rebranding Roverman's enterprise as his own, Carver took Paris McKenna as his first wife. Before marrying Elliot, Paris Carver was romantically linked to James Bond.
In the present, Carver is a billionaire international media mogul of the German-based mass media company, the Carver Media Group Network. He frequently uses his influence to gain advantage for his firm or wreak havoc on opponents. Moreover, CMGN is typically the first to report on scandals and disasters due to the fact that it directly orchestrates them. During one of Carver's daily teleconferences, various heads of his divisions smugly gloat over the terror they inflict upon the world: Jeff Hobbs reports ""floods in Pakistan, riots in Paris and a plane crash in California"" while Philip Jones has all current releases of CMG's software loaded with bugs, forcing consumers to endlessly upgrade. To boost his viewership, Carver instructs Tom Wallace to call the President of the United States and threaten to release scandalous photos of him with a cheerleader if he doesn't sign a bill lowering cable rates - and then to release the photos when he complies.
During the CMGN Satellite Network inaugural party, Carver denies claims that after British beef baron Sir Angus Black lost £10,000 in a game of poker to him and refused to pay up, he exacted revenge by releasing stories on Mad Cow Disease. He further retorted that there was even less truth to the rumor that the French paid him 100 million francs to keep the stories going.
Having been denied media presence in China, Carver attempts to provoke a war between them and the United Kingdom, hoping to wipe out the existing Chinese leadership in Beijing. This action would effectively allow the Carver Media Group secure exclusive broadcasting rights in China for the next century. To that end, Carver arranges for a stealth ship to be built, utilizing material smuggled by the Chinese general Chang. In return, Chang would be placed in the top seat within the Chinese government, while Carver would capitalize upon the coverage of the ensuing conflict.
During the initial phase of his plan, Carver sends American ""techno-terrorist"" Henry Gupta to purchase a GPS encoder (made by the American military) from a terrorist arms bazaar. Gupta then utilises the encoder to remotely interfere with the GPS systems of both the British HMS Devonshire and two Chinese MiG's. This sends the Navy frigate and Airforce jets off-course into what is perceived to be Chinese-held waters. Meanwhile, Carver has Richard Stamper and Captain Scott oversee the sinking of the Devonshire at the hands of his torpedo-like ""Sea-Vac"" drill (piloted by Timblin). From the Stealth Boat, Carver's forces unleash the Sea-Vac upon the warship and launch two guided missiles that obliterate the rival aircraft overhead. Carver then has his men eliminate the surviving crew with Chinese military-grade rounds while a diving team steals a cruise missile from the sunken ship.
Meanwhile, MI6 notices a spurious signal from one of the CMGN communications satellites, directed at the coordinates where the frigate was sunk. M sends James Bond to investigate Carver after his publication delivers news with critical details, hours ahead of competing media outlets. Bond travels to Hamburg and infiltrates Carver's launch party for his new satellite network. While posing as a banker, he meets the villain for the first time and also reunites with Paris. Carver develops an instant suspicion of Bond when the spy questions him about the applications of his satellites. He has his henchmen capture and attempt to interrogate Bond, but the spy escapes and cuts off power to Carver's live international broadcast, sabotaging the party and humiliating him.
Later, Carver learns by Gupta that Bond is a secret agent and commands Paris to get information from him as to why he was at the party and what he knows. Carver soon discovers that Paris and Bond are former lovers despite her claims that any former ties to the man were merely platonic. Feeling infuriated and betrayed, Carver has his wife killed by master assassin, Dr. Kaufman.
As Bond further investigates the Devonshire wreck, he discovers that the ship and aircraft had actually been in Vietnamese waters during the Stealth Ship's attack. During this time, Bond also discovers that People's External Security Force agent Wai Lin had also been probing Carver's activity. Previously, the two had encountered one another twice at Carver's Hamburg HQ - first at the launch party and later that subsequent day. The pair of agents are eventually captured by Stamper and taken to Carver at a CMGN tower in Saigon. Meeting with them, Carver reveals his plans to the pair and prepares to have them tortured by Stamper. However, they manage to escape and subsequently agree to collaborate on the investigation.
The two find Carver's stealth ship in Ha Long Bay and board it to prevent the madman from firing the stolen cruise missile at Beijing. During the battle, Wai Lin is captured but Bond manages to evade Carver's henchmen by using one of the guards to fake his death. On the ship's bridge, Bond captures Gupta to use as his own hostage. However, Carver kills Gupta as the final stage of the plan is set to go forth. Despite being cornered, Bond detonates an explosive, damaging the ship and making it visible to the Royal Navy's radar. Carver eventually sneaks up on Bond in the control room and holds him at gunpoint; he explains to Bond that by foolishly destroying the stealth ship, any evidence of Carver's actions is also destroyed. As the mogul pontificates, Bond secretly activates the Sea-Vac. With the roar of the drill having momentarily distracted the enemy, Bond is able to disarm him. He then holds a screaming Carver in front of the approaching drill and releases him at the last possible second, shredding him to pieces as Bond escapes.
Bond ultimately thwarts Carver's plan by positioning detonators on the missile to ensure its destruction before launch. With confirmation of Carver having expired in the Stealth Ship's destruction, M releases a news story stating that Carver went missing while on board his luxury yacht in the South China Sea, while the authorities believed he committed suicide.
Raymond Benson's novelization to the film adds more background to Carver's pre-film biography. The film itself mentioned that he previously worked for a newspaper in Hong Kong, but the novel reveals that he was the illegitimate son of the British newspaper baron Lord Roverman and a German prostitute. His mother died in childbirth, and his father paid a Hong Kong family to take him in. His foster father revealed on his deathbed who Carver's father really was. Carver went on to become a TV anchor in Hong Kong until he went to England to notify his father that he knew who he was, and his father tried to bribe him into never coming back. Carver then met Stamper and had him follow his father, and Stamper discovered that Lord Roverman was having an affair with an American prostitute and that he enjoyed dressing up in a Catholic school-girl's uniform while she spanked him. Carver tortured his father with this information until Lord Roverman re-wrote his will to make Carver his sole heir. Roverman then went back to America to find that Stamper had already murdered his mistress. Stamper then gave Roverman a gun and pressured him to commit suicide which he subsequently did. Roverman's wife and daughter tried to contest his will as they did not even know of Carver's existence, but Carver won in court and inherited his father's fortune.
Carver appears throughout several points in the narrative, ultimately serving as the game's final boss. While his role in the adaptation is largely unchanged from that of his film depiction, the final altercation differs significantly. Unlike in the film, Carver engages Bond in a deadly firefight, utilizing a powerful submachine gun rather than the handgun from the film. Upon losing the showdown, Carver slowly succumbs to his injuries but not before activating the stealth ship's self-destruct countdown. With his dying breath, Carver assures Bond that escape is futile and that his media empire shall live on. As he keels over, the player is able to pick up Carver's weapon as well as the keycard needed to deactivate the missile launch.  
Personality-wise, Carver is manipulative and vengeful, remorselessly murdering anyone he deems useless or a traitor. Carver is also vain and highly narcissistic, going so far as to decorate his headquarters and other places pertaining to his media empire, with tapestries and over sized banners that bear his visage. It also appears that Carver has a rather unique affinity for television screens since all of his bases are saturated with unusually grand quantities of video screens, some large enough to cover several meter-high walls.
Physically speaking, Carver poses no real threat and would much rather rely upon his vast legion of henchmen before getting involved in any altercations himself. Possessing a rather wiry frame coupled with a thinning head of neatly trimmed grey hair, Carver (in traditional Bond Villain fashion) is perpetually seen wearing a series of identical black Nehru suit jackets; the media baron usually wears these vestments over a black mock-neck shirt and matching dress slacks. His most distinguishing feature, perhaps, are his reflective steel rimmed glasses with which he is never seen without.

1303,/wiki/Charles_Robinson_(Colin_Salmon),"Charles Robinson is a fictional MI6 aide and Deputy Chief of Staff who appears in the James Bond films Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Die Another Day (2002). He was portrayed by British actor Colin Salmon.
Robinson fulfilled much the same role as Bill Tanner, bringing Bond up to speed on the latest events and the parameters of his mission.
Robinson serves as the intermediary between Bond, the command center (headed by M and Admiral Roebuck) and the support ship HMS Chester as the latter infiltrated a terrorist arms bazaar on the Russian border, part of a joint operation between that country and the United Kingdom. Bond's mission was simply to perform reconnaissance before the Chester launched a cruise missile that would kill ""half the world's terrorists,"" according to Admiral Roebuck.
However, upon the agent's discovery of a pair of SB5 nuclear torpedoes affixed to one of the aircraft being sold at the bazaar, a shocked Roebuck immediately phoned the Chester and ordered them to abort the missile. It was out of range and Bond, hearing this from Robinson, sprang into action to steal the jet and managed to evacuate the torpedoes moments before impact. The command center initially believed, due to the destruction of their cameras in the area by the blast, that he had been unsuccessful. Bond then radioed the center and asked where the admiral would like the armaments delivered.
A short time later after Bond had returned to England, Robinson accompanied him, Moneypenny, and M as the agent was briefed on his next mission: to investigate the actions of media mogul Elliot Carver and his relation to the sinking of the HMS Devonshire, a ship that had been seemingly sunk by Chinese MIGs during a confrontation. As a result of the escalating tensions between England and China from this incident, which in reality had been engineered by Carver utilizing a stealth ship, the two countries seemed prepared to go to war. As Robinson and M observed the fleets of the two countries nearing one another in the South China Sea, Carver's plot was exposed.
Robinson is seen here and there but mainly visible near the end of the film when he, R (who has just become the new Q) and M all notice via satellite footage that Bond is having a rather erotic encounter in a hotel with Christmas Jones.
Robinson appears at the beginning during a realistic training simulation that Bond is participating in and later reappears near the end of the film while working with the NSA and M to help diffuse the growing threats by the main antagonists. Upon the arrival of Bond and Jinx, informs that the North Korean hardliners staged a coup and are preparing to invade South Korea under the leadership of Graves [Colonel Tan-Sun Moon].
Initially Charles Robinson was intended as a replacement for the character of Bill Tanner when Michael Kitchen was unavailable to reprise his role from GoldenEye. However, since his performance in Tomorrow Never Dies, he went on to appear in three consecutive films as a regular. Both characters then appeared in The World Is Not Enough.

1305,/wiki/Della,"During the pre-title sequence of Licence to Kill, Felix is on his way to marry Della when he unexpectedly learns that drug lord, Franz Sanchez, is in Florida. With the help of his Best Man, James Bond, Leiter pursues Sanchez and they return victorious. They parachute into the church and the wedding commences. At the reception, the bride and groom present 007 with a gift - an engraved cigarette lighter. Following the festivities she unintentionally references Bond's earlier short-lived marriage to Tracy Bond, unsettling him, and unintentionally foreshadowing her own fate. Leiter lifts her across the threshold of their bedroom only to be ambushed by two of Sanchez' henchmen. Their leader, Dario, steps out from behind the door and cudgels Leiter with his pistol. After killing Della in a manner suggestive of rape, the unconscious Felix is taken to a warehouse. Asking where is his wife, Dario mockingly informs him ""We gave her a nice honeymoooooon..."" Sanchez then lowers him into a shark tank. A visibly shaken Bond later finds Della, dead, on her bed, and soon swears to wreak havoc on the men responsible for her death and Felix's maiming.
In the 2020 anthology comic book published by Dynamite Entertainment, Della is mentioned by Leiter as his late wife and briefly appears in flashbacks. In this timeline, she lived long enough to mother two daughters, Cedar and Kelsey. Leiter divulged to Bond that after her death, his relationship with his daughters deteriorated. Her cause of death, however, was not disclosed.

1307,/wiki/General_Ourumov_(Gottfried_John),"General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov (In Russian: Аркадий Григорович Урумов) is the fictional commander of the Russian Space Division, a member of the Janus Syndicate and the tertiary antagonist of the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. Portrayed by the late German actor Gottfried John, the character would later appear in the 1997 video game GoldenEye 007, also as an antagonist.
In 1968, at the age of 18, he graduated from Moscow Military Academy. In 1970, he graduated from the School of Applied Military Science in Kiev. Later that year, he was promoted to Captain and was posted to an advanced Army Missile Test Range from 1970 to 1975.  
In 1975, he was promoted to Major and was assigned to the Soviet Space Division from 1975 to 1981. Ourumov then served in the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan where he survived the explosion of a nearby tank, giving him a phobia of them as a result. Some time later, he was promoted to Colonel and assigned to a Chemical Weapons Facility in Arkhangelsk.
In 1986, Ourumov, who had grown tiresome of having little power, was finally promoted to Colonel and was given the important job of being in charge of a Soviet Russian Chemical Weapons Factory. During his early days in his new position he meets a young and bitter Alec Trevelyan, who tells Ourumov of his past, his hatred for MI6 and his future intentions, but making sure to leave out a few vital details about himself. Alec offers Ourumov a part in his plan and that he will be paid well and receive his status as the next ""Iron Man Of Russia"", Ourumov graciously accepts. The two pledge not to see each other until Alec Trevelyan and James Bond were to go on a mission to destroy Ourumov's base. However, Ourumov and Trevelyan had different plans. Trevelyan deliberately gets himself caught by Ourumov and his men, and Bond witnesses Ourumov shooting Trevelyan in the head. Ourumov attempts to catch Bond and almost succeeds, but Bond just manages to escape.
The shooting was staged, however. Unbeknownst to Bond, Alec is alive, albeit deeply scarred on the right side of his face. He becomes an international terrorist under the name ""Janus"" (The two-faced Roman god). A disgraced Ourumov was later court-martialed for the destruction of the Arkangelsk chemical facility and facing the likely fate of a death sentence. However, Colonel Ourumov perjured himself by claiming one of his deceased underlings had failed to take precaution in caring for the chemical vats which caused the explosion. This explanation is bought by the Soviet command, and Ourumov is cleared of all charges and restored to position. Some time later, Colonel Ourumov receives a general's promotion and a new assignment with increased prestige: commander of the Severnaya Space Facility in Siberia. Ourumov also has the job of employing another member for The Janus Crime Syndicate - he hires Xenia Onatopp, an ex-Soviet fighter pilot, whom he is familiar with. For the next nine years The Janus Crime Syndicate would terrorize Russia without getting caught and all their identities remaining secret and Ourumov was earning more power, which was starting to trouble the Russian Government.
In 1995, the general completes the establishment of their syndicate's greatest weapon: ""GoldenEye"". Two GoldenEye satellite dishes were built: one in Siberia, and one hidden in Cuba. Anyone who became suspicious of Ourumov ended up dead at the hands, or perhaps the thighs, of Xenia.
The Syndicate's first act is the theft of the Tiger helicopter - Ourumov and Xenia personally took care of the operation under the strict order of Janus not to fail. They successfully manage to steal it before Bond can stop them, and arrive in Siberia hours later where the second act of their operation would take place. Ourumov made sure to hire the most intelligent computer programmer to take care of the GoldenEye weapon: Boris Grishenko. Ourumov and Xenia enter the satellite base where the corrupt general orders one of his men to give him the GoldenEye and authorization codes they need to testfire the GoldenEye. Upon receiving these, Xenia suddenly shoots everyone in the base, and together they arm the GoldenEye to fire on Severnaya in order to eliminate the evidence. However, one employee of the Severnaya facility, Natalya Simonova, was in the break lounge at the time of the shooting and spared the massacre. Her hiding is almost discovered by Ourumov, but the noises heard are chalked up to another surviving employee who covertly activates an alarm, then is quickly shot again by Xenia.
Ourumov and Xenia take Boris with them and escape moments before the GoldenEye weapon detonates. Meanwhile, at a Russian air base two hundred kilometers away, the activated alarm is heard and three pilots are ordered to fly to Severnaya to thwart any attackers. However, the electromagnetic storm that fires on Severnaya fries the circuitry in the MiGs, causing all three pilots to be killed with one crashing into the radar dish at the facility. Natalya survives by hiding in a cupboard then escaping into the tundra, calling for Boris. As this is happening, Xenia and Ourumov are protected from the EMP blast by their stolen helicopter. Afterwards, Ourumov proceeds to Saint Petersburg to report to Defence Minister Dmitri Mishkin. Ourumov blames the Severnaya attack on Siberian separatists and resigns his command of the program due to his apparent failure to stop this, but is then shocked to learn that Simonova is alive and he leaves immediately, frustrated with Xenia's failure to kill ""everyone"". He assigns Boris and Xenia to find her, which doesn't take them long. Ourumov takes Simonova to Alec's hideout, where he ties her up in the Tiger helicopter to await her death. Bond also ends up in the helicopter, moments after learning that Trevelyan is alive and that he is a traitor. Bond and Natalya escape moments before the Tiger helicopter's heat-seeking missiles fire back on itself, but they are soon caught by Russian troops and taken to the military intelligence archives and locked in a prison cell.
Later, upon hearing that Dimitri Mishkin has Bond and Natalya in custody, Ourumov arrives and storms into the cell where Mishkin is interrogating the pair. Ourumov argues with Mishkin, trying to convince him that Bond is the traitor. Believing Natalya's story concerning Ourumov's treachery, Mishkin yells for a guard to arrest him, but the general quickly shoots Mishkin's bodyguard and then Mishkin himself with Bond's gun. After improvising a cover story, Ourumov then calls for the guards to kill Bond and Simonova. However, the spy hurls a chair into Ourumov's legs and struggles him, then throws him headlong into a wall. While he's dazed, Bond takes on two soldiers who enter the cell, then arms himself before escaping with Simonova. Ourumov leads his soldiers throughout the archives, searching for the pair. Ourumov's men manage to capture Simonova, leaving Bond to escape on his own. Ourumov takes her and one of his men and they escape out onto the streets of St. Petersburg by car, but Bond hijacks a tank and suddenly bursts through a wall in pursuit. He leaves a path of destruction behind him as he chases Ourumov through the busy roads, but the general soon arrives at Alec's converted missile train.
Ourumov boards the train with Simonova, and explains to Alec that Bond has escaped. Later, their journey is halted by Bond, who uses the hijacked tank to stop the train. He then boards the damaged train and holds Trevelyan and Xenia at gunpoint. Ourumov is called into the room, holding a gun to Simonova's head. Bond reveals to Ourumov that Alec is a Lienz Cossack, leaving Ourumov shocked - however, Trevelyan smooths things over by telling him how rich and powerful he will soon be. He then nods for Ourumov to shoot Simonova, but his real intention is for Ourumov to distract Bond while he and Xenia escape, turning the general into a sacrificial lamb. At this point, Ourumov is too slow and ends up being shot to his death by Bond's Kalashnikov, thereby putting an end to the ""Iron Man Of Russia""'s life.
During his time as a soldier, Ourumov's T55 tank was attacked by another tank. Ourumov was the only survivor, and the accident left him with a fear of tanks. After his Military Career, he worked as the overseer of the chemical facility near Archangel port, where he met Janus before the laboratory's destruction, and his promotion. He was given a position in the Russian Ministry of Defense, and was placed in charge of the GoldenEye weapon. However, he began to work with the crime boss Janus to help him steal the GoldenEye. Ourumov and Xenia Onatopp were sent to Monacco to steal the experimental Tigre helicopter. They then took it to the Severnaya facility, and set the GoldenEye that was stored there to destroy it before stealing the device, and flying away. After reporting the attack as the work of Siberian Separatists to Minister of Defense Viktor Mishkin, he was informed that a Severnaya worker had escaped. After trying desperately to find this one person who may have seen him at the facility before detonation, he discovered that James Bond and the programmer Natalya Simonova were being interrogated by Mishkin. Ourumov burst in on the interrogation to defend himself against any possible hints that he was not loyal to Russia, and killed Mishkin before capturing Simonova and taking her to Janus. On the way, Bond chased them through St. Petersburg in a tank. After arriving at Janus' trainyard Ourumov killed the driver of his car and handed Natalya off to Xenia. Ourumov then guarded Simonova on the short journey before he was called to bring her to another car. There James Bond informed him that Janus was a Cossack. This caused Ourumov to question his loyalties before being shot in the head by the escaping Janus.

1308,/wiki/Darius_Alizadeh,"Darius Alizadeh, is a character in the 2008 James Bond Novel Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks.
Darius Alizadeh, codename Pistachio, was the Persian SIS Station Chief. He remained loyal to M even though there was seldom any work for him. When Agent 007 was sent to Persia to investigate Dr. Julius Gorner, Darius gave him information on the country and took him to an opium den. When they exited, they discovered that Darius’ driver had been murdered. The next day, Bond went to the Caspian while Darius attended Hamid's funeral. Darius then lost contact with Bond, but was later contacted by Felix Leiter, who set up a partnership between Darius, himself, and his associate J.D. Silver. Silver promised to get them a line to Washington D.C. in order to share Dr. Julius Gorner's plan with the United States. Ten minutes after Silver departed to get something from his car, Darius and Leiter discovered that he had cut the line. They then chased Silver through the streets, and entered a firefight. Darius was able to call London in a phone booth before Silver shot him through his heart.
"
1309,/wiki/Gala_Brand,"Gala Brand is a policewoman assigned to England's Special Branch. Her full first name is Galatea, after the cruiser in which her father was serving when she was born. She is a former Wren, and at the time of Moonraker she is a Special Branch agent. Posing as Sir Hugo Drax's personal secretary, she is assigned to provide security for the construction and launch of his prototype atomic missile, Moonraker, for which the book is named. As Drax is something of a lecher, as M explains to Bond, Gala also pretends to be engaged and wears a ring to help fend Drax off, a tactic which eventually succeeded, but not before he made at several passes at her.
Bond is assigned to oversee security for the project a few days before the Moonraker's test launch; the last minute assignment occurs because of the death of his predecessor, Major Tallon. Tallon was killed by one of the missile technicians, a German in Drax's employ who publicly shot Tallon after loudly telling him ""I love Gala Brand. You shall not have her."" The episode is curious because Gala has reported that Tallon, much older than she and happily married, had never shown any romantic interest in her during the months they worked together.
Because Bond sees Gala's personnel file during his preparatory briefing, we (and he) have the unique opportunity in this case to have a clinical description of a Bond Girl's appearance, including her hair color (auburn), eye color (blue), height (5'7"") measurements (38-26-38), weight (9 stone, or 126 pounds), and beauty marks (a mole on the upper curvature of her right breast). When Bond meets her in person at Drax's house, he finds her, in contrast to her file photograph, attractive to the point of outright seductiveness, but cool to the point of frigidity and utterly disdainful of any of his attempts even to talk to her. After months undercover as Drax's secretary, Gala has become entirely devoted to the project's success, and she sees Bond as an interloper and treats him as such.
Along with seeing her official file, we also have the rare treat of overhearing some of Gala's thoughts about Bond. A dedicated policewoman, she sees Bond as a sort of playboy-adventurer of the stereotypical secret-agent sort dreamed up by writers of thrillers and not a real detective, doubting that he can be of any use on the project. Nevertheless, she admittedly finds him very handsome and, like Vesper Lynd before her, she sees a resemblance to Hoagy Carmichael. Despite Bond's attractiveness, however, she takes a dim view of him, and she lets him know this by ignoring him as much as possible.
During a walk on the beach below the Moonraker's silo to check security arrangements around the exhaust tunnel, however, Gala begins to open up somewhat to Bond. When he suggests a swim, she rather coyly gives in and strips down to her underwear out of Bond's sight. While she is swimming, Bond leaps out of the water next to her and kisses her before she realizes what is happening. Furious, she nevertheless finds herself excited and her aloofness soon vanishes. Later, the two lie on the beach to dry, still largely undressed, when an explosion buries them in rubble, nearly killing them both. Bond manages to pull the debris from Gala and the two return to Drax's house.
Later, when driving with Drax to London, Gala employs her skills as a pickpocket to sneak a look at the Moonraker's gyroscope settings, discovering to her horror that they will cause the Moonraker to hit London. At that moment she intuits that Drax plans to put an atomic warhead on the rocket, but before she can report what she has learned, Drax and her henchmen discover that she is a policewoman and knock her out. Because she had agreed to meet Bond in London for dinner, Bond grows suspicious when she fails to appear and at Drax's city house spots Drax's henchman stuffing Gala into the back seat of Drax's car. Bond chases Drax but is knocked out and captured when he wrecks during the chase.
After Drax interrogates Bond and Gala, Bond uses a blowtorch with his mouth to burn through the wires restraining Gala. The pain is terrible, but as he recovers she kisses him, her eyes shining. Gala reprograms the missile to fall into the North Sea, and the two hide in a close embrace in an exhaust duct as Drax's men search for them. Then, as the missile launches, they embrace again under a running shower adjacent to the silo in an attempt to survive the missile exhaust. The missile explodes in the North Sea, killing Drax and his men.
Bond arranges to meet Gala the following day after their debriefings. Gala is to receive the George Cross (Bond's service discourages the awarding of decorations), and the two are under orders to leave England for a month as part of the cover-up of what really happened with the Moonraker. Bond is in St James's Park delightedly planning his month with Gala when she arrives. She looks very beautiful, but he immediately senses that this beauty is intended for someone else. Nervously, she points out a young man a hundred yards away, identifying him as her fiancé and telling Bond that she is to be married the following afternoon.
Bond, tasting the bitterness of failure, is angry with himself for supposing Gala's ring and her story about being engaged to have been a fabrication. He realizes, however, that he needs to relieve her of any awkward feelings about his interest in her. He rather playfully tells her that he is envious and that he had other plans for her the following night, and, laughing in relief, she assures him that there are many other women waiting for him. The two part amicably, and Bond recedes regretfully back into his cold existence.
Gala is remembered by Bond, and is mentioned as being married as Mrs. Vivian with three kids in Richmond, Virginia. Bond exchanges Christmas cards with her, but he has not seen her again since the Moonraker incident.
Gala is the most professional of all of Fleming's Bond Girls, being practically the only one to have an independent career. In this she is like Dr. Holly Goodhead of the film, who is the first cinematic Bond girl to have a job that is not related to an intelligence service. Unlike Holly Goodhead, though, and despite her interlude with Bond on the beach, Gala is also the only one who rebuffs Bond and who clearly belongs to another. The concluding scene in the novel gives us a view of Bond as a Byronic figure of whom we see occasional glimpses in other Fleming novels.
Practically alone of all major Bond Girls of the Fleming canon, Gala Brand has not appeared as a character in a James Bond film, the movie version of the novel being an almost total rewrite of the book Moonraker. The only other Bond girl of the Fleming novels to share this fate is Vivienne Michel of the novel The Spy Who Loved Me. However, actress Rosamund Pike, in the DVD commentary for the 2002 Bond film, Die Another Day, states that her character, Miranda Frost, was originally to have been named Gala Brand, but that this was changed at the last minute.

1310,/wiki/Gretta,"Gretta was a fictional intelligence operative and the girlfriend of spy, Mike Channing. The character served as an ally and Bond girl in the James Bond comic strip, Trouble Spot, which ran in The Daily Express newspapers between December 28, 1971 and June 10, 1972.
Gretta (surname unknown) was the girlfriend of a spy named Mike Channing. Armed with thigh-holstered pistol and frequently changing her surname, she was herself implied to have a shady intelligence background. She was intimately familiar with Channing's activities behind the Iron Curtain; including the existence of a mysterious box which he had brought back with him. Channing left the box with his wife, Folly Wilde, in Belluna, California, before departing on an ill-fated mission that ended with him imprisoned in Poland. After his escape, Gretta awaited him at a hotel in the French Riviera. However, she was met instead by James Bond, who had assumed the man's identity after his untimely demise in a traffic accident outside Paris.
The pair decided to cooperate - united by their common goal of obtaining the Box. She remained in the hotel while Bond went to meet with a mysterious contact, ""S"", and was subsequently abducted from the room. ""S"" was revealed to be Soviet agent, Baron Sharck, who quickly recognised 007 and attempted to extract the location of the Box from him by threatening to torture the girl. Fortunately, her kidnapping drew the attention of the local police; creating an opportunity for the pair to escape. With Gretta's assistance, Bond confirmed that the trail led to Channing's wife and the pair departed for California by plane. They were followed by Sharck's men; one of whom attempted (and failed) to co-opt Bond's assistance by a phoney poisoning attempt.
Arriving in Belluna, California, the pair asked around for Mrs Channing and determined that she was hiding in a nearby nudist resort, Camp Heliotrope. Gretta persuaded Bond to once again pose as Mike Channing in a bid to enlist the assistance of his visually-impaired wife (whose sight had only recently been restored). After he successfully gained Folly's confidence, the mistrustful Gretta forcefully tagged along; concerned that Bond might cut her out of the deal. Together, they travelled to a coastal cave where Folly hid the Box - unaware that Sharck and his men had followed them with a homing device. A tense, armed standoff ensued. As night fell, Gretta impatiently betrayed 007 - holding him at gunpoint, taking his sidearm and the Box. As she ran, she was mowed down by gunfire from Sharck's men before she could high-dive from the cliff. With her dying breath, she had a change of heart and used her remaining strength to throw back Bond's pistol.

1311,/wiki/Camcorder_rocket_launcher,"Issued by R during James Bond's mission briefing, the compact missile launcher sees usage when 007 is attacked at Valentin Zukovsky's Caviar factory by King Industries helicopters equipped with aerial side-trimmers. Ordinarily disguised as a generic camcorder, when the micro sensors near the record button detect the operative's fingerprint pattern the camera functions as a miniature rocket launcher. It uses a compact, yet powerful heat-seeking stinger missile and is operated by aiming, listening for the lock-on notification and firing. Its primary draw-back is its limited magazine of three rockets, although Q-Branch provides an additional crate of ammunition in the trunk of 007's BMW Z8.
Featured only in the PlayStation variant of The World Is Not Enough, the camcorder rocket launcher replaces the BMW Z8's built-in rocket launchers.

1312,/wiki/Adam,"Adam was a fictional American gangster and enforcer to Mr. Big but mainly receives his instructions from Tee Hee; in some ways he can be considered to his right-hand man. The character appeared in the film adaptation of Ian Fleming's Live and Let Die, portrayed by Tommy Lane.
Adam first appears at the airport where Bond and a recently defected Solitaire are captured intending to force Bond to sky dive from a high altitude into the lake. Adam then leads Mr. Big's men in pursuing Bond after he escapes from the alligator farm. He accidentally brings Sherrif J.W. Pepper's attention for speeding, and J.W. attempted to arrest him but Bond surprised him by jumping the boat he was driving over them while Adam manages to make a getaway.
Adam later steals a speedboat from J.W.'s brother-in-law, Billy-Bob to chase Bond and, at the climax of the chase near an abandoned tanker, is doused in petrol by Bond. Disoriented by this attack, he loses control of his boat as it crashes into the tanker and perishes in the explosion.

1313,/wiki/Bambi_(Lola_Larson),"Bambi is a fictional acrobatic guard tasked by Ernst Stavro Blofeld with imprisoning the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte. The character was created and developed especially for EON Productions' 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever and was portrayed by actress and singer Lola Larson.
James Bond travels to a luxury mansion in the suburbs of Las Vegas where he believes the millionaire Willard Whyte, hostage to Blofeld, is imprisoned. Entering the house, he is greeted by two athletic women appearing from nowhere. Both appear as Bambi and Thumper and immediately begin to attack Bond using various athletic jumps and kicks. Bond is even choked by Bambi's thighs, but soon gets out from that predicament, only to be thrown into an outdoor pool. Sensing an opportunity to finish Bond off, the two women dive in to the pool and attempt to drown him.
The exhausted and beaten Bond looks to be easy prey for these nimble karate experts and they quickly seize the advantage and hold Bond's head underwater. However, it soon turns out to be a tactical error for the ladies. Transferring the fight to the deep end of the pool, negates their martial arts skills and Bond is quickly able to turn the tables on the girls and holds them both underwater until Felix Leiter and his men show up. Bond continues to hold the ladies underwater for 30 seconds as they thrash about. By now their struggle indicates that they are desperate for air. 
Bond lifts their heads up for a quick breath but then it's right back under immediately while he talks amusedly to Leiter, who complains about Bond wasting time in the pool. The bubbles and struggles of the women underwater indicate that they are near drowning at this point and Bond senses that they might be ready to talk. Bond first releases Thumper, and she desperately uses her last breath to swim to the poolside while Bond continues to hold Bambi under. 
Thumper knows that her partner needs air so she complies by pointing to the shed below where Whyte is being held. Then Bond releases his hold on Bambi, who desperately breathes and swims to the side, humiliated. Bond, heading for Whyte, leaves behind the exhaustedly coughing women who are holding on to the sides of the pool, gasping for air.
What happens to Bambi after that is unknown. However, it is likely that she experienced a very unpleasant fate, wheter arrested or taken back to Blofeld. In this last case, she was probably killed by her boss as a punishment for her failure.
She is named after ""Bambi"", the titular main character and protagonist in the Disney animated classic Bambi (1942).

1315,/wiki/Dr._Bechmann,"Dr. Bechmann was a fictional scientist associated to Stromberg Shipping. A minor character, he appeared in the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, portrayed by the late British actor Cyril Shaps. Bechmann was also seen in the film's accompanying novelisation, penned by Christopher Wood.
Very little of Dr. Bechmann's background is provided and what he is a doctor of is never revealed. He works with Professor Markovitz to create Karl Stromberg's submarine tracking system. Considering he created such a successful system, it could be surmised at one point in his life he earned a doctorate in chemistry or physics.
After the successful capture of HMS Ranger and the Potemkin, Stromberg calls the two men into his office, saying he is pleased with the system and that Dr. Bechmann and Professor Markowitz are to be paid $10 million apiece for their efforts. Stromberg then reveals secrets of his have been compromised and takes an accusatory tone of voice.
He tells that someone has been trying to sell the scaled-down photographic reproductions of submarine tracking system schematics to competing world powers. Ordering his assistant out of his office strongly suggests Dr. Bechmann or Professor Markovitz is guilty. As the beautiful woman is standing in the elevator, Stromberg presses a button which causes the floor to give way and she falls into a shark tank; the shark swims after her and eats her, which is viewed by Bechmann, and both he and Professor Markovitz react with horror at this. Stromberg's tone changes to a pleased one, reiterating his congratulations to the scientific pair for their system.
Bechmann is last seen boarding a helicopter flying away from Atlantis, and shaking hands with his partner over their success. Shortly into the flight Stromberg blows up their helicopter, killing the two scientists. Stromberg then orders that Dr. Bechmann's next of kin be informed that a ""tragic accident has taken his life, and the funeral was at sea"".
Bechmann also appears in this novelisation but survives. Stromberg does not blow up the helicopter upon its departure, and Bechmann and Markovitz presumably enjoy their payment.

1319,/wiki/Craig_Mitchell_(Glenn_Foster),"Craig Mitchell was the fictional personal bodyguard of MI6 Head, M, and secretly an operative of the criminal organization, Quantum. A minor antagonist portrayed by stuntman Glenn Foster, the character appeared in the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace. He would later feature in the tie-in video game of the same name, re-named Henry Mitchell and voiced by American actor Fred Tatasciore.
Craig Mitchell worked for the head of the British Secret Service, M, for eight years; five of which were spent as her personal bodyguard. Despite passing a full security check and lie detector test every year, the MI6 operative was, in reality, secretly working for the criminal organization, Quantum. He accompanies M to a safe-house in Siena, Italy, where Quantum enforcer Mr. White is being prepared for interrogation, following his abduction by James Bond. Bond meets with M and greets Mitchell, who acknowledges him by name. During their discussion, the bodyguard excuses himself to check the perimeter; during which time he secretly murders an agent tasked with guarding the entrance. He returns a minute later to report that all is clear.
As the interrogation commences, White appears amused by MI6's obliviousness to Quantum's existence and informs her that his organization has operatives planted everywhere. White looks to Mitchell, who draws his weapon and kills the security guard present. In the chaos, Bond attempts to wrestle the weapon out of Mitchell's hand, causing a shot to discharge and hit White in the shoulder. The traitor eventually gains the upper hand, knocking Bond to the ground and flees through a tunnel system, emerging in the middle of Siena's Palio Horse Race. Pushing through the crowds, Mitchell snaps off several shots behind him, killing an innocent bystander. Eventually the chase leads to the rooftops, concluding with a climactic struggle atop a bell tower. The two men lose their footing and fall through the glass ceiling of an adjacent building. Frantically, they attempt to recover their dropped weapons, but 007 reacts quicker and shoots first, killing the bodyguard.
Later, Bond meets M at Mitchell's apartment in London. MI6 have been forensically examining the flat for evidence, but find nothing aside from some marked notes connected tenuously with a hitman named Edmund Slate. A frustrated M laments that he ""didn't leave so much as a scrap of paper to explain any of it"". Among his personal affects, she found an ashtray and three other Christmas presents she had bought him, suggesting a close working relationship between the pair. Among other details of the man's life, Tanner notes that he had no living family and gave generously to charity.
In the video game adaptation of Quantum of Solace, the character, now named Henry Mitchell and code-named 'Sleeper One', is present at the interrogation of Mr. White. He is phoned by Tanner and confirms that White is captive and about to be interrogated; as with the film, the interrogation is terminated by Mitchell's sudden intervention and 007 gives chase through the Roman tunnel system. Unlike the film, he is aided in his attempted escape by numerous squads of Quantum mercenaries. In all variants of the game, the chase concludes by both men falling through the glass ceiling of a building and results in a quick time event where the pair duel to the death. In the PC, X-Box 360, PS3 and Wii versions Bond deflects a blow from a pipe-wielding Mitchell, grabbing the implement and striking him with it, knocking him from scaffolding to his death on the floor below. In the PS2 variant, the two duel across each scaffolding platform until they reach the floor, where Bond reaches his fallen sidearm first. When Mitchell attempts to grab his pistol, 007 kills him.

The doctor places his hand on Bond’s shoulder, and tells that Ingber has suffered two fractured legs, frostbite, and advanced hypothermia in perfect English. He then invites Bond to the hospital to come see see her.
Following this, Bond calls an operator only to learn that Ingber has never arrived to the hospital nor can identity a doctor named Simonsson. It is quite possible that Simonsson was actually an agent of the National Socialist Action Army.

The book was a tie-in product based on the film of the same name. The paperback book and its accompanying cassette tape was written and produced by John Braden.
The book begins with James Bond returning to London with an indestructible microchip he recovered from the body of 003 in Siberia. Believing its manufacturer, Max Zorin, to be in league with the Soviets, Bond infiltrates his country estate posing as country sportsman, ""Mr. Sinjin-Smythe"". From his balcony, the Bond spots Zorin passing a mysterious girl (Stacey Sutton) a cheque for $5 million. The following day, the spy meets with Zorin to discuss buying a thoroughbred horse. Unbeknownst to 007, Zorin uses a computer and hidden camera to ascertain his true identity. The villain suggests taking a potential horse for a steeplechase ride. After Bond calms the drug-frenzied horse, Zorin drops the act and has May Day bludgeon him. They attempt to drown him in his Rolls Royce; but he regains consciousness and uses air from the car's tires to breathe.
Bond follows Zorin to San Francisco and spies on the villain's offshore oil rigs; noticing that water is being suspiciously pumped into the pipeline (which runs to Silicon Valley). He investigates at San Francisco City Hall, where he meets Stacey, who is revealed to be an oil heiress working against Zorin. That night, they return to examine the maps and determine the oil lines lead to an abandoned mine. Zorin and May Day arrive, set fire to the building and trap the pair in an elevator. They escape and, stealing a fire truck, set off after the villains. Infiltrating the mine, they discover Zorin is planning on destroying Silicon Valley using an artificial earthquake. After making a failed attempt to kill them by flooding the mine, Zorin escapes by airship with Stacey. Bond dangles from the craft, as the villain attempts to knock him into buildings - culminating in an axe brawl atop the Golden Gate Bridge. Zorin slips and falls to his death; with his men perishing in the exploding dirigible shortly afterwards. The book ends with Bond, on the bridge, asking Stacey out to dinner in Chinatown.

Whilst M, Q and Miss Moneypenny are enjoying the horse racing at Royal Ascot, James Bond is introduced to Sir Godfrey Tibbett. He puzzlingly tells him that he has never seen a horse perform so well in the late stages of the race, suspecting foul play by Max Zorin.
Later, Tibbett accompanies Bond to Zorin's Chateau where he poses as Bond's chauffeur, although Tibbett gets more than he bargained for when he is made to carry a multitude of Bond's baggage to his room. Bond then plays a recording of himself haranging Tibbett, suspecting the room is bugged. He and Tibbett go to the veranda to have an actual conversation about Zorin. Tibbett remarks it is quite a bit of work pretending to be a put-upon Man Friday.
As night falls, the pair uncover Zorin's secret underground surgery room and warehouse.
However, when Zorin discovers Bonds true identity, he arranges for him and Tibbett to be killed. Tibbett is the first to go. He is killed by May Day when she grabs him from the back seat and strangles him as the 1962 Rolls Royce drives through the car wash. Back at the track, Bond attempts to flee with Tibbett, only to see May Day wearing Tibbett's driving hat and pointing a pistol at him. Bond is overpowered and forced into the Rolls Royce alongside Tibbett's corpse, where both have an ""underwater funeral"" by being buried in a lake, courtesy of May Day shoving the car into the water. Bond sees that Zorin and his henchmen are standing by the shoreline, prepared to shoot him should he swim back up. Bond saves his life by unscrewing the cap on one of the Rolls Royce's tires, then helping himself to compressed air until Zorin, confident 007 is dead, leaves.
Tibbett have the personality of a seasoned English gentleman, he is very patient to Bond's over the top demands. Sir Godfrey possessed a gentle and friendly personality, which is very much unlike his position in British Intelligence.

1326,/wiki/Clown_(James_Bond_Jr.),"The Clown was a fictional unnamed laboratory assistant and right-hand man to vengeful scientist, Hope Eternal. A one-shot antagonist, the character appeared in episode 15 (""Never Lose Hope"") of the 1991 spin-off animated television series, James Bond Jr.
An accomplice of vengeful scientist, Hope Eternal, the unnamed assistant was tasked with abducting the nephew of 007. Following several botched attempts, he cornered Bond Jr. and his friend Gordo as they shopped at a mall near Warfield Academy, disguised as a sinister clown. The students eventually managed to evade him by flipping the direction of an escalator. Later, Hope infiltrates Warfield and stages a fake abduction during a field trip to the planetarium. Bond chased the Clown's car to an abandoned building; just in time to see the villain taking off in a helicopter.
The antagonists left a series of coordinates scrawled on the ground; luring Bond Jr. and his friends to an abandoned S.C.U.M. laboratory in the Pacific. There, they capture the students and prepare to scramble Bond's brainwaves in revenge for the supposed death of Hope's father at the hands of 007. They bound him to an operating table, but before they could harm him Bond activated his rocket sneakers and launched the table into the equipment behind him - causing it to overload. In the chaos, he freed himself and raised a cage around Eternal and her assistant, pulling the plug before the machine exploded. The clown's fate is unknown.

1327,/wiki/Braun_(OHMSS),"Braun is first seen during James Bond's arrival at Piz Gloria under the alias of Sir Hilary Bray. After rolling out a red carpet, he proceeds to help Fraulein Bunt and ""Bray"" out of the helicopter. Looking at the guard's sidearm, Bond comments ""Fraulein, I should warn you guns make me very nervous."" To which Bunt attempts to reassure the apparently nervous genealogist. During dinner, Braun is seen serving as a waiter.
Later in the film, with fellow guard Felsen, he accompanies Bunt in her pursuit of the escaping Bond through the Swiss village of Lauterbrunnen. Tracking him to a shed filled with bells, both men brawl with the spy, but are overpowered by him. Although knocked out by Bond, the pair are woken up by Bunt in order to continue the pursuit.
Escaping, 007 attempts to mingle in with the crowds near the village Ice Rink. As Braun and Bunt close in on him, he is approached by hir girlfriend, Tracy, who leads him to her car. Realizing that Bond has evaded them, the thugs return to their car and set off in pursuit, almost killing the spy as he attempts to use a phone-box to communicate with London.
In an attempt to evade them, Bond and Tracy veer into the middle of a stock car race. As expected, Bunt and her men follow and carnage ensues. Sitting in the front passenger seat of the car, Braun manages to get a few potshots at Bond's car before his own car is toppled. The vehicle's occupants are forced to abandon the burning car before it explodes. 
Later, someone resembling Braun takes part in the shooting at Piz Gloria where he is shot to death by James Bond after attempting a failed sneak attack, a little time after the death of Grunther. Interestingly, he seems to have blonde hair at the back of his head, which Braun does not have in any other scene, but Bond repeats his ""guns make me nervous"" line, originally directed at Braun, to him after shooting him, making whether this is actually Braun or not unclear.

1328,/wiki/Bird_One,"Osato Chemicals and EngineeringA two-stage rocket, Bird One uses two vehicles mounted on top of another, each of which contains its own engines and propellant. It is piloted by two astronauts from a cramped cockpit in the second-stage orbiter. When it runs out of propellant, the first stage is jettisoned in low orbit and presumably burns up in the Earth's atmosphere. The second stage vehicle continues to orbit under its own power. The orbiter has a segmented nose that can be opened to engulf smaller space vehicles within its cavity. Before it re-enters the atmosphere, the craft is oriented with its aft section pointing 'downwards' towards its landing destination; an orientation that keeps the vehicle's heat shields facing the majority of the heat generated by friction. Within the atmosphere the orbiter jettisons its heat shield to reveal a set of rocket boosters which control the vehicle's descent. On landing, three landing struts extend from Bird One's sides and it lands vertically. Notably, the orbiter is equipped with a remote self-destruct mechanism.

1329,/wiki/General_Gogol,"Ministry of Foreign AffairsDespite the popular assumption about the James Bond series' Cold War focus, Gogol is never depicted as a true villain. At his most hostile, he is a respectful competitor and more often is an ally against the common foes of peace. His first appearance is in The Spy Who Loved Me, where he is seen sending Anya Amasova to recover an important roll of microfilm.
Later in the film, Gogol and James Bond's superior, M, form an alliance, which is the start of the Anglo-Soviet relationship as a result of their mutual pursuit of Karl Stromberg.
Gogol is seen next in Moonraker, talking to USAF Colonel Scott over the telephone about Hugo Drax's space station. He tells the Americans it is not a Soviet station and that they would investigate it themselves after the US had intercepted it. Colonel Scott apologizes for calling Gogol at a bad time due to the time differences, but Gogol says there is nothing to apologize over, as ""problems in Russia keep him awake"", just as he is seen with an attractive Russian woman in a nightgown.
In For Your Eyes Only, Gogol wants to buy an ATAC communicator from Aristotle Kristatos, after the ship carrying it is sunk in an accident. Kristatos recovers the unit and arranges a sale at his private headquarters, but Gogol arrives there just as Bond and his allies are going after Kristatos for the murders he has committed to retrieve the device. When Bond throws it off a cliff, Gogol is initially dismayed but keeps his guard from shooting Bond; as Bond notes that his actions maintain détente, Gogol chuckles as he acknowledges Bond's observation that the machine's destruction allows the nations to remain in their relatively peaceful status quo. The assistant of General Gogol, appearing briefly in For Your Eyes Only, is called Rubelvitch, a wordplay on the name Moneypenny.
In Octopussy, when General Orlov proposes invading the West, Gogol is the loudest voice opposing the reckless plan, asserting both the danger of provoking a nuclear war and that the USSR wants peace, not war. Gogol's investigations of Orlov's scheme to weaken NATO's defence runs parallel to Bond's, but his subordinates' unauthorized fatal shooting of the traitor prevents him from learning the full details of his plot and warning NATO, though Bond is able to stop Orlov's plan on his behalf, and later appears before M to inform him that his government will deny the incident and request that Bond return their treasure Romanov Star that he has in his possession which Orlov previously stole.
In A View to A Kill, Gogol in first seen in France. He reprimands Max Zorin, an erstwhile KGB agent, for killing 007 without the KGB's approval beforehand. Zorin thinks of himself as no longer part of the KGB. Gogol also learns of Operation Main Strike, and demands Zorin stop at once.
When Zorin defies the order to stop his plan, Gogol sends KGB agent Pola Ivanova to see what Zorin is up to. When Pola meets Bond, she tries to take the tape from him and give it to Gogol. Gogol is embarrassed that Pola got the wrong tape.
At the end of the film, Gogol awards Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's plan to destroy Silicon Valley, stating that Bond was the first non-Soviet citizen to receive it and that the KGB has its own heart of operations producing their own technology at Silicon Valley (being awarded this medal contradicts a statement in the novel Goldfinger that stated that people in the British Secret Service could not accept awards from foreign services, no matter how friendly (such as the CIA). However, Bond may not have accepted the award, and the Russians may have insisted he was awarded it anyway, whether he'd accepted the medal or not.)
In The Living Daylights, Gogol is mentioned as having retired from the KGB and his position being succeeded by General Pushkin, He is only seen in the end, as a diplomat in the Foreign Ministry. He attends Kara Milovy's concert with M, offering Milovy a visa which would allow her to leave the Eastern bloc at will.

1330,/wiki/GoldenEye_(novelisation),"GoldenEye was the second and last Bond film to be adapted as a novel by then-current Bond novelist John Gardner. GoldenEye is based upon the screenplay by Bruce Feirstein and Jeffrey Caine. The book follows the movie storyline fairly closely, however Gardner maintained a rather violent sequence prior to the opening bungee jump in which Bond wipes out a group of Russian guards cut from the film, although the popular video game based on the film featured it also.
The book was Gardner's penultimate Bond novel; after one more entry in the series (COLD), Gardner would retire from chronicling the adventures of 007. Raymond Benson would take over the series and also write the novelisations for the remaining three Brosnan Bond films, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day.
James Bond awoke in 1986 Russia in the forest surrounding a dam near the port at Archangel ready to begin his part in Operation Cowslip. He and Alec Trevelyan, Agent 006, were assigned to infiltrate a suspected chemical weapons plant in the dam. He then stalked to the bottom and climbed up a narrow ladder built into its surface and into a guard quarters on top. After eliminating the guards, Bond performed a bungee jump to the base where he found an open maintenance shaft which he climbed down into a small room where he met up with 006. The two then made their way through the facility placing explosives until Trevelyan was captured by Admiral Arkady Ourumov. Bond survived the encounter by hiding behind a cart of chemicals, and escaped the facility after detonating the charges by stealing a plane.
Nine years later, in the summer of 1995, Bond was in Monte Carlo for his five-year evaluation, proctored by a specialist named Caroline. During a drive on the Grand Corniche, Bond entered a street race with a woman in a yellow Ferrari 355. Caroline demanded that he stop, and after saying goodbye to her at the Nice airport, went into one of the many Casinos and found the girl from the Ferrari at the Baccarat table. After winning the hand, he found that she was a Georgian named Xenia Onatopp. She left with an American Naval Rear Admiral named Chuck Farrel, and Bond watched as they boarded a yacht called the Manticore. Bond then took a small boat out and boarded the yacht to find Farrel murdered, before realizing that the incoming Tigre helicopter, France's premiere prototype flying machine, was in danger. He crept to the deck and was faced with two ex-KGB thugs that he nicknamed ""Big Muscle"" and ""Tub 'o Lard"". He brutally defeated them before taking a small boat out to another craft in the water on which the Tigre had just landed. He made his way on to the launch pad, and noticed that despite the helicopter's pilots being listed as male, Bond recognized the cat-like walk of Xenia Onatopp, and called out that the pilots were impostors, but was tackled to the ground.
He was released after revealing his rank, and voiced his suspicions of the Janus Crime Syndicate's involvement to the new M. She was cynical, but was forced to accept Bond's theory when Miss Moneypenny informed them that the French air force had found the missing Tigre.
Elsewhere, Xenia Onatopp and her superior General Ourumov stole the GoldenEye weapon from the Severnaya facility before setting the weapon to destroy it. However, one of the Technicians, named Natalya Simonova, escaped the explosion by stumbling upon a team of dogs on a sled, whose driver had died in a crash shortly before Onatopp and Ourumov arrived.
Bond, M, and Bill Tanner watched the destruction of Severnaya on a live satellite feed, and noticed that one survivor had escaped the facility. Bond was then sent on Assignment GoldenEye to locate the survivor and question her.
Elsewhere, Viktor Mishkin, the Russian Minister of Defense held a meeting with General Ourumov about the misfire of the GoldenEye weapon. Much to the General's surprise, Mishkin reported that two technicians had gone missing. The General's ignorance of the matter made Mishkin doubtful of Ourumov's story that the attack had been carried out by Siberian separatists. Ourumov then set Boris Grishenko to the task of locating his former coworker.
Bond then met up with his American contact Jack Wade who took him on a tour of St. Petersburg and showed him the way to Janus' biggest competition: Valentin Zukovsky. After finding his ex-KGB rival, Bond was knocked out and taken to Zukovsky's office where they made a deal in which Bond would save a shipment of explosives for Zukovsky, and he would help Bond set a trap for Janus. Instead of coming in person, Janus sent Xenia Onatopp instead. Bond was able to capture her, and forced her to lead him to Janus, who turned out to be his old friend Alec Trevelyan: 006. Bond almost immediately asked him why he had defected, and Alec retorted that he saw no future as a ""worker ant"", and went freelance. Bond then asked whether or not his being of Linez Cossack descent had anything to do with his decision. Alec confirmed his suspicion before a sniper hit Bond in the chest with a tranquilizer. He awoke in the cockpit of the Tigre, with Natalya Simonova begging him to wake up. He noticed that he was tied up, and began to try switches with his face before noticing a countdown on the console. When it reached zero, two rockets shot out of the helicopter and began to make their way back toward it. Bond then asked Simonova to locate the eject button, and he pressed it with his right temple. They then shot into the air, and were briefly engulfed by the explosion before landing. The ejection and blast having loosened his ropes, Bond helped Simonova out of the cockpit before they were captured by the Russian government. They were then interrogated by Viktor Mishkin, who was then murdered by Ourumov who who began to pursue Bond and Natalya. They tried to escape through the National Archives, but Natalya was caught in the process.
Bond jumped out of a window in the archives to escape, and managed to commandeer a T55 tank to pursue Ourumov in. He chased Ourumov's car through St. Petersburg before discovering that he was heading for the trainyard, and continued at a steady pace. James then situated his tank in a tunnel that the train was approaching, and destroyed the engine. He then climbed aboard and took Trevelyan and Onatopp prisoner. Alec then offered to give him Natalya, and escaped after killing General Ourumov who had brought her in. Natalya then learned their destination by sending a computer spike to Boris Grishenko before Bond but through the floor with a laser in his watch and they escaped the train car before it exploded. Bond and Natalya then walked to a restaraunt where they called Jack Wade, Who was able to disguise them and send them to Puerto Rico to take down Janus. They waited in a CIA safehouse before a plane came for them to fly to Cuba. While over the jungle, they discovered a circular lake out of which came a missile that shot them down.
No sooner had they escaped the wreckage, than did Xenia Onatopp descend upon them on a line from a helicopter. She tried to kill Bond, but He was able to shoot the helicopter off balance, causing her to be crushed between two tree branches. They then began to climb up the satellite dish that had risen out of the water, but were discovered by Alec Trevelyan on security cameras. Bond and Natalya broke into the control room, and Bond was captured while Natalya broke into the mainframe computer room and broke the GoldenEye's navigation system. She was captured, but the damage she had inflicted was enough to stall the satellite. Boris Grishenko, who had taken Bond's explosive pen, accidentally armed it, and Bond kicked it into the air where it exploded, causing several fuel tanks from an earlier firefight with Bond to do the same. Bond then began climbing the dish and put a mine in its hydraulics that allowed it to re-position, and fought with Alec in the maintenance room before the mine exploded causing him to fall out of a hatch in the floor. Bond allowed him to fall, and was rescued by Natalya in a helicopter. they then reunited in a jungle clearing, surrounded by Jack Wade and the United States Marines, who retreated to leave the couple in peace.

1331,/wiki/Dominic_Greene,"Greene runs an organisation called Greene Planet, which is supposedly devoted to buying up large sums of land for ecological preservation. However, Greene is secretly a member of Quantum, a criminal organization which accrues power and influence through world finance and geopolitics. During the events of the film he is spearheading their Tierra Project in Bolivia.
When showing Camille Montes the body of her informant, he relates the story of how when he was 15, he had a crush on one of his mother’s piano students. He overheard this girl saying mean things about him. Angry, he presumably killed her with an iron.
Greene Planet is a front for his real plan, to control various commodities such as oil and water, the latter having to do with his current plot. Greene plans to control the supply of water in Bolivia, which if successful will put his organization in control of the country's most vital asset. To make the transaction, ""legal,"" Greene approaches the president of Bolivia with an offer - a large sum of money for 60% control of the water. The president refuses, so Greene takes his offer to the exiled dictator of Bolivia, General Medrano. He makes the general an offer to return him to power in exchange for a large region of apparently barren land. Medrano accepts, thinking the barren region to be worthless. It is only after the transaction has been made that Greene reveals his extortionate plans.
Greene's mistress, Camille Montes, has been wanting to see Medrano for a very long time. The general had murdered her family some years previous, and Montes has been looking for him ever since. When she found out that Medrano was in business with Greene, she became involved with the villain, in order to get to Medrano. Greene knows this, and arranges for Montes to be killed. She is saved, however, by James Bond. She confronts Greene, who turns her over to Medrano, asking him to throw her overboard when he's done with her. Medrano takes her on a speedboat to his yacht, but Bond intervenes. Just as she is about to kill Medrano, Bond pulls her into a separate boat. After a long chase, Bond leaves Her on the warf. Bond inadvertently helped Greene's plan by saving Medrano's life.
Greene then moves forward with his plan. He meets with Quantum at a performance of Tosca. When Bond infiltrates the meeting, Greene leaves in a hurry. When Greene gets to his car, a henchman falls out of the sky and onto the car. He has his driver shoot the wounded man, then speeds away from the scene, blaming the man's death on Bond.
He then hosts a party, celebrating the conservation of land in Bolivia. He uses this party as an opportunity to make new deals, one of which is interrupted and terminated by Camille Montes. Greene, furious, takes to a balcony and tries to push her to her death. Bond intervenes, and leaves with Montes. Greene sends his henchman Elvis after them, but he's injured by Strawberry Fields, who trips him and sends him tumbling down a staircase. Greene later has Fields murdered by drowning her in oil.
He then leaves to make his deal with Medrano, and the Colonel Carlos, who earlier had Bond's contact René Mathis killed. He meets with Medrano and Carlos, giving Carlos his money first. When Medrano inquires after his own cash, Greene explains a little side deal. In order for Medrano to get the money to overthrow the government, he has to sign over 60% of all Bolivian water. When Medrano refuses, Greene explains that he had first gone to the current president, and offered him the same deal, and met with the same answer. Medrano reluctantly signs it over, in order to get the money.
Everything seems alright - until 007 breaks in. There's also a nasty little surprise. Bond has killed Carlos, and in doing so set the building on fire. Medrano has already left for his room, which leaves Greene, Bond, and Elvis in the conference room. Greene orders Elvis to kill Bond, but before he can do so, the explosions reach the three opponents. Bond and Greene race for cover, but Elvis is incinerated. In the hallway, Greene attacks Bond with a fire ax. They battle over the flames on a catwalk which eventually collapses. Bond leaps for dry land, but Greene starts to plummet towards the flames. Bond grabs Greene by the hair, saving his life.
Meanwhile, in Medrano's room, Montes and the General battle. While Bond attempts to pull Greene onto firm ground, they hear a shot. Greene laughs, thinking that the general has murdered Montes.
Bond responds by lifting Greene up to the catwalk and rushing away to save Camille. He walks in to find Medrano dead, and Camille attempting to escape from the inferno. They manage to escape, and Bond sees that Greene survived, and is currently trying to escape on foot with a leg injury.
Bond captures Greene, who reveals everything he knows about Quantum. In exchange, Bond doesn't kill him. However, he leaves him in the middle of the desert that Greene had just bought, and gives him a can of motor oil (a reference to Strawberry Fields's death by the hands of his agents), betting that he'll make it twenty miles before he's tempted to drink it. Later, following Yusef Kabira's arrest, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the desert, with two bullets in the base of his skull and motor oil in his stomach; implying his execution by Quantum for leaking information, similarly to how happened to Le Chiffre before him.
An intelligent, ambitious, cunning and manipulative sociopath, Dominic Greene showed a highly opinionated and callous personality. He was quite a social climber, well-respected for his wealth, intellect and so-called ambitions. However, underneath it all, he was a cruel, malicious and arrogant man. He covered his tracks splendidly and knew quite a bit about how the Secret Services of the world work.
He was highly well-connected, and was able to side with the Bolivian chief of police and also General Medrano. Greene was quite cunning and manages to blackmail Medrano into signing over the money that Greene demanded (Double of what they had previously agreed), at the same time showing to Medrano how ruthless Quantum could be and that Medrano, whether he liked it or not, was completely expendable to them.
Dominic Greene was extremely devious and nobody could predict what his next move was going to be. Unfortunately, he had a habit of picking the wrong people to side with: He lost General Medrano to Camille, and beforehand he lost the Bolivian chief of police to James Bond. He was sadistic, taunting Bond when the latter believed Camille to have been killed by General Medrano. This showed him to be quite reckless, as Greene was about to fall to his death when he taunted Bond, who could have easily killed him for that remark. Greene was a coward, and did whatever he could to escape Quantum, and the wrath of James Bond, after he revealed every last secret of his secret organisation.

1332,/wiki/Casino_Royale_(location),"Casino Royale is a fictional casino which first appears in Ian Fleming's 1953 James Bond novel Casino Royale, located in the fictional French seaside resort of Royale-les-Eaux. The casino was subsequently featured in the 1954 CBS television adaptation and official 2006 Eon film adaptation of Fleming's novel (with the latter casino located instead in Montenegro). A very different version of Casino Royale also appeared in the unofficial 1967 spoof film of the same name.
Casino Royale is located in the fictional French seaside resort of Royale-les-Eaux. There had been a casino at Royale (as the town was formerly named) since the Victorian era. But since then the once popular coastal town had fallen on hard times, losing business to the towns of Le Touquet and Deauville. The town thereafter survived on seaside holidaymakers in the summer and its small fishing fleet in the winter, as well as ""the crumbs which fell to its elegantly dilapidated Casino from the table at Le Touquet"".

For the EON Productions film adaptation of Casino Royale, the Casino's location has been changed to Montenegro. During the film, the terrorist financier Le Chiffre uses a Ugandan warlord's money to short-sell stock in an aviation firm, thus betting the money on the company's failure. After his plan to bankrupt the company is foiled by the intervention of James Bond, Le Chiffre is left with a major financial loss and is forced to set up a high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro to recoup the money. Intent on preventing this, the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6) sends 007 to participate in the tournament using government funds. Unknown to Bond, the American CIA had also sent a participant to the event, Felix Leiter. Despite several setbacks, the Bond won the tournament, netting $115,000,000 (115 million US dollars).

Father to Colonel Moon, General Moon is a wise moderate man who assists in Bond's release back to the West. The North Korean general wishes for a peaceful reunification of Korea, whereas his son is bent on war. When Bond seemingly assassinates Colonel Moon, the general has him imprisoned and tortured for more than a year. He eventually releases him in exchange for the release of Zao, who had been captured by the West for terrorism.

He is later to be accompanied by Gustav Graves as he demonstrated the power of the new Icarus heat-ray in Iceland. On Graves' giant plane, while he and his officers are having a conversation with Graves, Graves tries to convince the him that the General himself is his father by saying the General's personal memorized tactics. Now the General learns that Graves is actually the new identity of his still living son, Colonel Moon, hiding behind a new face thanks to gene therapy.
Graves hoped his demonstration of power to break the Korean Demilitarized Zone in order to invade South Korea would impress his father, but instead Moon realizes that his son is insane and threatens to kill him with one of the officers' Makarov, saying that the plan will instead destroy themselves and his real son died long ago. Graves disarms his father and, stating his disappointment in him, shoots him in the chest, killing him as other officers seeing their comrade getting murdered by his own son.

1339,/wiki/Goldeneye_(Estate),"Goldeneye Hotel and Resort is luxury resort property developed from the original estate of writer Ian  Fleming, Goldeneye, in Oracabessa on the island of Jamaica. Located next door to Golden Clouds estate, it is jointly owned by Island Records founder Chris Blackwell and Island Outpost, a company that owns and operates his boutique hotels.
Goldeneye was originally built by novelist Ian Fleming, who created the James Bond character and wrote all of his Bond novels while living there.
In 1976, 12 years after Fleming's death, Goldeneye was sold to reggae star Bob Marley. Shortly before his own death, Marley sold it to Island Records founder Chris Blackwell. For years he primarily used the estate as a place to entertain friends.
Rather than a traditional hotel, Goldeneye resort is a compound of tropical buildings, gardens and private beaches. It closed in 2007 for major additions and renovations, and reopened in December 2010.
Fleming's Goldeneye became the social epicenter of Jamaica's north coast along with nearby Firefly owned by Noël Coward, and Bolt House, owned by Chris Blackwell's mother, Blanche, who was a long time friend of Fleming. The property was equally popular with a coterie of Hollywood stars and British literary greats as it was British aristocrats and international heads of state. Errol Flynn, Lucian Freud, Truman Capote, Patrick Leigh Fermor, the Duchess of Devonshire, Princess Margaret, and Prime Minister Anthony Edenwere all visitors. Eden even made the property the temporary Headquarters for the British government during the Suez Crisis of 1956.
The Goldeneye of the Blackwell era has also attracted celebrities, both as his friends and resort guests. Among them Bono, Naomi Campbell, Michael Caine, Pierce Brosnan, Harrison Ford, and Richard Branson.
A tradition, which was started by Sir Anthony Eden when he and his wife, Clarissa, planted a Santa Maria tree before departing from Goldeneye, is still ongoing. Today, there are hundreds of mango, lime, orange and ackee trees in the garden. Each was planted by a guest, has a small plaque saying who planted it and when. A $1000 donation required goes to the Oracabessa Foundation.

The main villain of the novel is Colonel Sun Liang-tan. Sun is a member of the Special Activities Committee of the Chinese People's Liberation Army as well as a sadist and skilled torturer. Sun takes a perverse pleasure in inflicting all sorts of pain upon 007 in the belief that “through cruelty one rises to heights of superhuman awareness”.

1342,/wiki/Bond_movie,"Harry Saltzman (1962-1974)Michael G. Wilson (1977- )Barbara Broccoli (1983- )$16.1 Billion (adjusted)There are also two additional James Bond films, Casino Royale (1967) and Never Say Never Again as well as a single TV production of Casino Royale.
The films, derived from Ian Fleming's series of James Bond books began production after Fleming's novels failed to take off in the television sphere with a 1954 production of Casino Royale. In 1959, Albert R. Broccoli began pursuing the books for film adaptation and in 1961 his new business partner Harry Saltzman purchased the rights to all of Fleming's novels (except Casino Royale). The two began shopping Dr. No and Thunderball to production studios for funding but were shot down several times until United Artists struck a deal to produce Dr. No for $1.2 million. Broccoli and Saltzman then founded EON Productions to manage the film's production.
Broccoli and Saltzman began a UK-wide search to cast Bond and held a ""Find James Bond"" contest to encourage auditions. The winner, Peter Anthony, dropped out due to stress. Patrick McGoohan, Richard Johnson, James Mason, Rex Harrison, David Niven, Trevor Howard, and Broccoli's friend Cary Grant were all in contention at one point but Sean Connery won out in the end, having proven himself to the producers in his roles in On the Fiddle and Darby O'Gill and the Little People.
Connery appeared in five Bond films; 1962's Dr. No, 1963's From Russia with Love, 1964's Goldfinger, which made the franchise a cultural phenomenon and was very the first time it was recognized worldwide,1965's Thunderball, and 1967's You Only Live Twice; before announcing that he was leaving the series at the end of his contract. He was burnt out due to the rapid schedule and wanted to branch his career out.
Broccoli and Saltzman began another search for Bond and decided on Timothy Dalton who turned the role down because he believed he was too young for the role. The producers eventually discovered George Lazenby in an action-themed Fry's Chocolate Cream commercial. His Australian nationality caused something of a stir in the Bond community but his 1969 film On Her Majesty's Secret Service turned out to be a decent critical and commercial success. Lazenby's talent agent urged him to move on from Bond and use his press to launch his acting career. He heeded his advice and dropped his 7-film contract.
Frustrated with Lazenby's departure, Broccoli and Saltzman wanted to reassure audiences of EON's steadfastness and the franchise's future by delivering another crowd-pleaser. They tried to recreate the magic of Goldfinger by getting director Guy Hamilton and star Sean Connery back together for another United States based Bond film. Connery demanded a $1.25 million paycheck plus 12.5% of all gross profits and an additional $145,000 per week if the film was in theaters for over 18 weeks. His fee was outrageously high for 1971 but producers granted it to him and the 1971 film Diamonds Are Forever was released to thrilled audiences and critics. Connery later used all his proceeds from the film to fund the Scottish International Education Trust, a scholarship for Scottish artists.
Rejuvenated with the success of Diamonds Are Forever, Broccoli and Saltzman began a third hunt to cast James Bond. They were searching for a Bond who would best represent the 1970s — suave and progressive. Jeremy Brett, Michael Billington, and Julian Glover were all considered but Roger Moore landed the spot. His previous TV roles in The Saint and The Persuaders gained him nation-wide attention and respect in the UK. Moore made seven films, making him the longest-tenured Bond in EON productions. He first appeared in 1973's Live and Let Die followed by 1974's The Man with the Golden Gun, the final film to be co-produced by Harry Saltzman who left due to immense debt causing him to lose his EON shares. Moore's popularity grew with 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me, the first Bond film crafted from entirely original material, as Fleming was dissatisfied with his novel of the same name. Moore also proved he could take Bond beyond any imaginable limits in 1979's Moonraker and 1981's For Your Eyes Only after which he decided to leave the role.
Michael G. Wilson joined the production team at this time, and a search began for a new Bond. The producers eventually settled on American James Brolin and he was signed. Brolin even went so far as to buy a home in England. But the announcement that the non-EON production Never Say Never Again would star Sean Connery as Bond made the producers unwilling to launch a new Bond opposite Connery. Consequently, they re-signed Moore for two additional films, 1983's Octopussy and 1985's A View to a Kill, after which Moore finally hung up his holster at age 57.
Dalton was first approached to play Bond in 1969 and later in 1981 but was finally free from other obligations for 1987's The Living Daylights and felt he was finally ready to helm the role of 007. (Pierce Brosnan was briefly considered but was busy with Remington Steele.) Like Connery and Moore before, Dalton was a Bond for his era. More hard-edged than his predecessors, it is said that Dalton's Bond most accurately reflects Fleming's Bond.
Dalton returned in 1989's Licence to Kill which was fraught with complications. The film was the first to stray extremely far from Fleming's source material, to save money the film was shot in Mexico rather than Pinewood Studios, and the title was changed from License Revoked close to the release date. Its performance was mediocre at the box office but the real problems came with the sale of MGM and United Artists to Pathé Communications. EON's parent company Danjaq sued Pathé for television distribution rights, freezing all Bond productions until 1995. In the run-up to what would have been his third Bond film, The Property of A Lady, Dalton stepped away from the role in 1994 when he chose not to renew his contract.
After a seven-year hiatus many wondered if Bond was still relevant to the world, namely since many of his foes were from the now-dissolved Soviet Union. At age 86 and fed up with the previous years of legal disputes, Albert R. Broccoli stepped away from the Bond series and was replaced by his daughter Barbara Broccoli.
Without a star for Bond, Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson decided to rejuvenate the franchise. They had previously met Pierce Brosnan on set of For Your Eyes Only and his schedule was now free for him to don the tuxedo as Bond. Brosnan portrayed a Bond for the 1990s — technologically and culturally savvy. The 1995 film GoldenEye also brought on Judi Dench as M and was met with the highest attendance rates since Moore's films. Brosnan's success continued with 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies, 1999's The World Is Not Enough and 2002's Die Another Day. Brosnan, now 50 years old, decided to leave the series on a high note in 2004.
Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson once again had a blank slate and had an opportunity to reinvent the Bond franchise. The success of the gritty and realistic films The Bourne Identity and Batman Begins, and the recently acquired rights to Fleming's first novel Casino Royale led the producers to entirely reboot the series with an origin story that was focused on Bond's motivations rather than gadgets, guns, and girls, but all that still existed in the Craig films. In October 2005 Daniel Craig was announced as the new Bond. Die-hard fans complained of his blonde hair but his strong performance won their support.
2006's Casino Royale was one of the franchise's highest grossing entries and successfully launched Craig's burgeoning career. 2008's Quantum of Solace was met with less acclaim but still performed strongly at the box office. The twenty-third Bond film was in preproduction when MGM declared bankruptcy in 2010. The film was postponed indefinitely (although Broccoli, Wilson, and Craig worked unofficially) until January 2011. The film, Skyfall was released in October 2012 — fifty years after Dr. No first hit the silver screen in 1962. As of the release of the film, it turned out to be a newer phenomenon grossing over $1,000,000,000 in the box office. It outperformed Thunderball in the box office, known as the most successful Bond film to date prior to Skyfall's release. The next Bond movie, Spectre, was less well received than Skyfall, but was still commercially successful, grossing over $880,000,000. No Time to Die was released in 2021 with Daniel Craig returning to the role once again and grossing $771,076,078 as of December 12, 2021. This film was announced as Craig's final appearance as Bond.

1345,/wiki/Felix_Leiter_(Literary),"Felix Leiter is James Bond's CIA ally and friend, played a part in six of the Fleming novels. Originally from Texas, he is introduced in Casino Royale as being thin, tall, about thirty-five years old and a former member of the U.S. Marine Corps who was working with the Joint Intelligence Staff of NATO. Fleming named the character after two of his American friends: ""Felix"" was Ivar Bryce's middle name, whilst Tommy Leiter was a mutual friend. Academic Kerstin Jütting describes Leiter as ""a cool and quiet no-nonsense character who knows 007's strengths and weaknesses well"". Physically, Fleming describes Leiter in Casino Royale: ""a mop of straw-coloured hair lent his face a boyish look which closer examination contradicted"".
Academic and writer Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier, considered that this view of Leiter was partly because of Fleming's writing, noting that ""Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization ... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he"". Bond scholars Bennett and Woollacott note that although the two men share adventures, it is Bond who leads, not Leiter. Leiter's role is to ""suppl[y] Bond with technical support and hardware, add ... muscle where needed and money"".
Fleming's second novel, Live and Let Die shows that in his early twenties, Leiter wrote a few pieces on Dixieland jazz for the New York Amsterdam News. He and Bond visit a jazz club in Harlem to find Mr. Big and are captured. Leiter is let go by a henchman of Mr. Big's due to his love for jazz music. Later, while investigating a warehouse in Florida owned by Mr. Big, Leiter falls into a shark tank and is severely mauled, but survives. Bond scholar John Griswold notes that in the original draft of the story, Fleming killed Leiter off in the shark attack; when Naomi Burton, Fleming's US agent with Curtis Brown protested about the death of the character, Fleming relented and Leiter lived, albeit missing an arm and half a leg. Espionage scholar Rupert Allason, writing as Nigel West, noted that Leiter's involvement in a domestic US matter was a breach of the CIA's charter, as laid out in the National Security Act of 1947.
After the shark attack, Leiter returned in Diamonds Are Forever with a hook for his missing hand and a prosthetic leg; as he had lost his gun hand, he was no longer with the CIA, but employed as a private detective by Pinkertons Detective Agency, although he was on the reserve of the CIA and was recalled for Thunderball and The Man with the Golden Gun. He makes mention of having a sister. Fleming had flown to the US in August 1954 to research the background to Diamonds Are Forever; his friend Ernest Cuneo introduced him to a rich socialite, William Woodward, Jr., who drove a Studillac—a Studebaker with a powerful Cadillac engine. According to Bond scholar Henry Chancellor, ""the speed and comfort of it impressed Ian, and he shamelessly appropriated this car"" for Leiter to drive in the novel.
For the post-Fleming continuation Bond authors, Leiter has also appeared on a periodic basis. After John Gardner took over writing the James Bond novel series, Leiter made an occasional appearance and the novel For Special Services introduces his daughter, Cedar Leiter, who is also a CIA officer (and briefly Bond's romantic conquest). Raymond Benson also included Leiter's character in some of his novels, including The Facts of Death and Doubleshot. Similarly the more recent continuation Bond novels—the 2008 Sebastian Faulks novel, Devil May Care, and the 2011 novel Carte Blanche by Jeffery Deaver both contained the character.
Set in between The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy, Felix set the story in motion by referring Scarlett Papava to James Bond to help locate her sister. While working at Pinkerton's Detective Agency, Felix was sent on a case to investigate the disappearance of a B-Movie star from Hollywood at the request of her parents. He was then summoned back to the CIA, along with several other former operatives in preparation for taking part in overseas activity. Leiter went to Persia to meet with Darius Alizadeh, who had valuable information regarding the destructive intentions of Dr. Julius Gorner. Leiter arranged a meeting with his associate J.D. Silver, who betrayed them by cutting their phone line, as he believed that the United Kingdom suffering would get them to aid in the Vietnam War. Darius got the information through, and Silver was killed. He later met up with Bond in Paris.
Long after his amputations, Felix maintained a close relationship with the CIA as a consultant while still working at Pinkerton's. After Bond was discovered operating in the US, and Felix was called from Miami to deal with him. He learned that Bond had ""gone solo"" and was acting on his own rather than on England's behalf. After the operation was over, the two talked it over, adding in information the other didn't know and determined that their respective operations to kill Solomon Adeka and Hulbert Linck were just to give their countries access to the Zanzari oil reserves.
In the movies, Leiter is a CIA agent in all appearances except in License to Kill in which he now works for the DEA. A number of the movies feature Leiter, but the character is frequently recast and as a result has not achieved the memorable status that other characters such as M, Q and Miss Moneypenny have achieved. In fact, Leiter appears in a total of ten movies, played by eight different actors, widely varying in age and physical characteristics.

Fekkesh fails to meet James Bond at an arranged appointment at his home in Cairo, leaving Felicca to look after Bond instead, and goes to the Pyramids of Giza where he talks to Anya Amasova, a Russian agent. At the Pyramids, Fekkesh notices Stormberg's henchman Jaws nearby and runs for safety. Bond follows the men into an ancient tomb. Inside the tomb Jaws kills Fekkesh with a fatal bite from his metal teeth before Bond can reach them. After Jaws escapes, Bond finds Fekkesh's appointment book in his pocket which leads him to businessman Max Kalba.

1348,/wiki/Grappling_pistol,"The grappling pistol is a fictional grappling device developed by the British Secret Intelligence Service's (SIS/MI6) research and development division, Q-Branch. Such a device first appeared in EON Productions' 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger, with variants featured in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever and 1995's GoldenEye (equipped with a miniature laser cutter).
Similar devices became especially popular in Electronic Arts' James Bond video games as a means of traversing various levels of terrain; beginning with 2001's Agent Under Fire.
While infiltrating the Arkangel Chemical Weapons Facility by bungee jumping from the top of the facility's dam, James Bond utilizes a grappling pistol to grapple onto a section at the base of the dam and pull him towards an entrance point. He then used the pistol's built-in laser to cut open a panel preventing access to the chemical warfare facility's ventilation system.
Appearing in the 2004 video-game Everything or Nothing, named the Rappel Gun, the device is a grappling-hook pistol developed by Q-Branch. It fires a grappling hook to a secure holding point at the top of an accessible ledge, allowing its user to fasten a cable to their belt and climb or descend with ease.

1349,/wiki/Caroline,"Caroline is a fictional SIS/MI6 psychological and psychiatric evaluator who appears briefly in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. Played by British actress Serena Gordon, she is the first Bond Girl of the Brosnan era. The character is also featured in John Gardner's accompanying novelization.
Caroline sent to the south of France by the new M to psychologically evaluate Bond and accompanies him in his Aston Martin DB5. When 007 engages in a high-speed car chase with Xenia Onatopp the evaluator becomes noticeably agitated by his driving and eventually orders Bond to stop the car immediately. 007 complies and reveals a hidden bottle of chilled Bollinger and a rose. He then proceeds to seduce Caroline with ease. Later, in a meeting with M, the SIS Head notes that Bond's psychological evaluation was ""excellent"".
In John Gardner's 1995 novelization of the film, Caroline is implied to have come from a background of privilege, that she had either never thought about, or never felt guilty about. In her professional life, Caroline was sent to Monaco to issue Agent 007 his five-year evaluation of his tradecraft skills. While driving on the Grand Corniche, a road in the South Alps, Bond entered a street race with a woman in a yellow Ferrari 355. Caroline demanded that he stop, he reluctantly complied before opening one of his car's secret compartments that he informed her was usually used for a gun and taking out a bottle of champagne. She later bid Bond farewell at the Nice airport and had grown so fond of 007 that their parting brought tears to her eyes.
"
1350,/wiki/Adrian_Malprave,"Adrian Malprave was the fictional owner and CEO of Malprave Industries, a multinational conglomerate based in Switzerland. She appeared as the main antagonist of Electronic Arts' 2001 video-game Agent Under Fire, voiced by Corina Harmon (credited as Corine Harmin).
However, her plans are complicated by the resignation of one of her scientific minds, Dr. Natalya Damescu, who seeks out protection at the British embassy in Bucharest, Romania. In a bid to kidnap Damescu, Malprave has British diplomat Reginald Griffin replaced by a clone. Unable to remove the body from the Embassy, the clone zealously guards the locked room, which inadvertently draws the attention of MI6. The kidnapping is frustrated by the intervention of James Bond, who follows a trail of genetic samples - including that of Griffin - to the Embassy. Posing as a lost security guard, he accidentally encounters Malprave in Griffin's bedroom and pockets a nearby security card before she escorts him out. Unlocking the office, 007 finds Griffin dead and is held at gunpoint by the Griffin Clone. After overcoming him, Bond accesses Griffin's computer and finds a message from Malprave's underling, Nigel Bloch, ordering the clone to bring their defective merchandise (i.e. Damescu) to the Malprave Industries HQ, in Switzerland. Bond heads to Switzerland, where he attempts to interview Malprave as journalist 'Mr. Somerset'. However, he is informed that his interview has been delayed and is urged to wait in the CEO's office by her (presumably cloned) assistants Bella & Bebe. It is there that he recognizes Malprave from a stained-glass window and realizes that his cover has been blown. Attempting to kill him, Malprave promptly sets her security on the spy during his escape from the facility.
Continuing her plan to deal with Dr. Damescu, Malprave orders her associate Carla the Jackal to lead a raid on the Romanian embassy before the scientist can trade information about her Poseidon cloning facility to Bond and MI6. 007 inevitably foils the attempt on Damescu's life, procures the information and destroys the Poseidon facility. Teaming up with CIA agent Zoe Nightshade (whom Malprave had intended to replace with a clone, infiltrating the CIA), Bond heads to the Mediterranean G8 summit and, while unable to prevent Malprave's men from kidnapping the world leaders, he foils her attempt to replace them by destroying a helicopter transporting the replicas. Held under heavy guard at her headquarters in the Swiss Alps, 007 infiltrates the facility and frees the heads of government. In revenge, Malprave sets the base to self-destruct. After a firefight with Nigel Bloch, Bond follows him into Malprave's main office and shoots him with a rocket launcher, sending him crashing through the stained-glass window to his death. Just as Bond manages to leap free of the base before it explodes, Malprave appears and tries to jump clear too, but is consumed by the blast and dies. Bond lands on a military aircraft being commandeered by Zoe, and together they escape the smoldering base.

1351,/wiki/Algar_Hellebore,"After seeing Alfie Kelly drowning in Loch Silverfin, Algar ran to rescue him. He brought the boy to his brother and his assistant Dr. Perseus Friend, expecting that they would nurse him back to health. However, they had different plans, and used him as a test subject for Project SilverFin, which killed him on the first dose. Eventually, Algar found James Bond sneaking through the house, and fearing for the boy's life, he pursued him through the halls before grabbing the boy, who had fallen on the stairs and hurt his head, and tried to sneak him out of the castle before Randolph and Friend could get to him. Unfortunately, they found him and took the boy as a captive. After this, Algar was kept chained in the basement with their mutant pig test subjects. James was able to observe him cradling one of the doomed piglets.
Algar was still in the pen when Bond and his nephew George Hellebore came to destroy the lab. On their way out, they stopped to free the fearful Algar. James fumbled with a set of keys stolen from Randolph's office, but George quickly broke the lock off with a spanner. Algar then grabbed his piglet and ran for the exit. When Randolph was about to execute the boys for destroying his work, Algar rose from the water and attacked the man, ignoring his warnings to stop. Unfortunately, Algar took his double barreled shotgun blast to the stomach, but was strong enough to tackle his brother into the water. Algar's bleeding wound attracted the loch's eels to their bodies, but Algar made sure that Randolph died with him.

1352,/wiki/D-8_armoured_car,"The D-8 (Dyrenkov-8) was a Soviet armoured car. It was assembled in limited numbers from 1932–34 at the Izhorsky Factory near Leningrad. The vehicle appeared in Steve Cole's 2016 Young Bond novel, Strike Lightning.
Apparently among the vehicles supplied to Germany in violation of the Treaty of Versailles, several D-8 armoured cars (most of them open-topped variants) were employed in 1934 at Winter Immer, a subterranean research bunker outside Düsseldorf, Germany.  The two surviving participants of an exo-suit battle royale, James Bond and Kitty Drift, were rescued by the intervention of their friend Perry Mandeville, who had stolen one of the armoured cars.
"
1353,/wiki/Heinrich_Osten,"Inspektor Heinrich Osten, also known as Der Haken (German: ""The Hook""), was a fictional Austrian police detective. The character appeared as a minor antagonist in John Gardner's 1986 James Bond continuation novel, Nobody Lives for Ever.
After a roadside explosion of a silver Renault 25 driven by Steve Quinn and his men, Austrian police officers arrive shortly after the scene. Nannie Norrich identifies one of them as ""Der Haken"" (which translates to ""The Hook""), and claims he is ""the most ruthless, corrupt bastard in Austria."" Osten inspects the damaged Bentley Mulsanne Turbo vehicle, and introduces himself to the three. Bond drives Osten, Sukie Tempesta, and Norrich down to the police headquarters. 
There, two of Osten's men hustles Tempesta and Norrich away from Bond, while he and his three men escort Bond up the elevators to a luxurious apartment suite. Almost immediately, Osten tells Bond he will be a ""dead man"", and orders one of his men to make Bond turn on the television. Displayed on the television screen was news coverage of the exploded silver Renault surrounded by police and ambulance; also reported is Osten and his men being reported dead while Bond, Tempesta, and Norrich are said to be unidentified and wanted for questioning. 
Using a toolkit developed by Q'ute and his belt, Bond escapes through the window on the wall, and ultimately hears Wolfgang Mozart's music where he finds Osten's accomplices murdered with Osten himself hanged with the point of a hook inserted into his throat.

1354,/wiki/Aston_Martin_DB_Mark_III,"The DB Mark III (normally simply called Mark III, even at the time of its introduction) is a sports car sold by Aston Martin from 1957 through 1959. It was an evolution of the DB2/4 Mark II model it replaced, using an evolution of that car's W.O. Bentley-designed Lagonda 2.9 L (2922 cc/178 in³) straight-6 engine, redesigned by Tadek Marek. Ian Fleming's James Bond drives an Aston Martin DB Mark III in the seventh James Bond novel Goldfinger (1959).
Changes included a grille like that on the DB3S, a new instrument panel, and available Girling disc brakes. The hydraulically operated clutch was new as well, and an optional Laycock-de Normanville overdrive that was attached to the STD 4 speed gearbox after the 1st 100 cars or even an automatic transmission were available. Worm-and-sector steering and a live axle rear end were carry overs. At the rear, the DB2/4 Mark II's tailfins (after the 1st few early cars) were altered to use the rear lights from the Humber Hawk.
The standard DBA engine model with twin SU carburettors produced 162 hp (121 kW), though an optional dual-exhaust system (a claimed 16 b.h.p. increase) raised this to a reputed 178 hp (133 kW). Thus equipped, the car could reach 60 mph (97 km/h) in 9.3 seconds and hit 120 mph (193 km/h). An optional high-output DBB engine with three twin-choke Weber 35 DCO 3 carburettors, special long duration camshafts, high compression 8.6:1 pistons and the dual-exhaust system boasted 195 hp (145 kW), though this was rarer ( 10 cars thus equipped) than the mid-level DBD option with triple SU 1.75"" carbs and 180 hp (134 kW) also with the dual exhaust system, fitted to 47 cars. Girling disc brakes were fitted as standard to the front wheels of all Mk III Astons after the first 100 had been made. Many cars were upgraded later.
A 1959 review by Road & Track magazine praised the car for everything but its $7,450 price. ""A car for connoisseurs,"" they called it. ""The Aston has many virtues and few faults."" Among the faults was too-heavy steering effort, high door sills, and a stiff ride. Interestingly, R&T failed to comment at all on the car's innovative hatchback body style, complete with fold-down rear seats, although this had been first introduced in the 2/4 MkI in 1953.
James Bond drives an Aston Martin DB Mark III in the novel version of Goldfinger, though it is referred to as a ""DB III"" in the book – indeed, the chapter in which he drives to his famous golf-course encounter with the villain is entitled 'Thoughts in a DB III'. The ""DB3"" was a car designed specifically for racing and is unlikely that Bond would drive one. The DB Mark III is often called the DB III and is more comparable to its description in Fleming's novel.
It is the only Bond car in the Ian Fleming novels to have gadgets installed. It included switches to alter the type of color of the front and rear lights, reinforced steel bumpers, a Colt .45 pistol in a trick compartment under the driver's seat, and a homing device similar to the DB5 in the film. For the film adaptation five years later, the car was updated to the Aston Martin DB5 model and the array of gadgetry was much expanded. It was to become one of the most iconic of classic cars as a result.

1355,/wiki/Desert_Eagle,"Often renamed for copyright reasons, the firearm has been represented in a number of James Bond video games, including The World Is Not Enough (2000), Nightfire (2002), GoldenEye: Rogue Agent (2004), and Everything or Nothing (2004). It has been named alternatively the ""Raptor Magnum"" and the ""Jackal .357"" and is typically one of the more powerful handguns that the player can use during the game.
It appears as the Desert Eagle, and is one of the few handguns in the game. It is powerful and accurate, though ammo for it is typically quite limited.

1356,/wiki/British_Army,"The British Army combines the ground forces of the UK military.
She was formed in 1660, while Britain had no regular army before, since the Navy played a bigger role.
Over the years, the British Army participated in many armed conflicts, like Iraq and Afghanistan, The Troubles and both World Wars.
British Army personnel first appears in From Russia with Love, where an army officer listens together with M and other officials to Bond's message.
A mounted soldier of the 'Blues and Royals' regiment can be seen in A View to a Kill, guarding the entrance to the Horse Guards building, just opposite Old War Office Building.
In Tomorrow never dies, Royal Military Police officers can be seen guarding the entrance to the Ministry of Defence.

1357,/wiki/American_Motors,"American Motors Corporation(AMC) was an American automobile company formed by the 1954 merger of Nash-Kelvinator Corporation and Hudson Motor Car Company. At the time, it was the largest corporate merger in U.S. history.
George W. Mason was the architect of the merger to reap benefits from the strengths of the two firms to battle the much larger ""Big Three"" automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler). Within a year George W. Romney took over, reorganizing the company and focusing AMC's future on a new small car line. By the end of 1957 the original Nash and Hudson brands were completely phased out. The company struggled at first, but Rambler sales took off.
AMC purchased Kaiser's Jeep utility vehicle operations in 1970 to complement their existing passenger car business. Beginning in the early 1970s, they moved towards all-new compact car designs based on the Hornet, including the Hornet itself and the Gremlin. Other new models in the 1970s included the Matador and Pacer. As costs mounted, AMC reduced their overall line and began to focus almost exclusively on their Hornet-based cars and the Jeep line. While the new lines of the late 1970s, such as the Spirit and Concord, were variations on the Hornet's platform, the company continued with innovations on existing designs: the 4-wheel-drive AMC Eagle, introduced in 1979, was one of the first true crossovers.
From 1980, AMC partnered with France's Renault to help finance their manufacturing operations, obtain much-needed capital, and source subcompact vehicles. By 1983 Renault had a controlling interest in AMC. Production was discontinued for all AMC cars except the all-wheel-drive Eagles, to focus on promoting the Alliance subcompact. In 1987, after further new vehicle development that included the Medallion and an early, Teague-designed version of the new full-size front-drive sedan and a two-door coupe that later became the Eagle Premier, Renault sold AMC to Chrysler. The AMC and Renault brands were then discontinued in America. The Jeep/Eagle division of Chrysler Corporation was formed from the remains of AMC after Chrysler's 1987 buyout. The Jeep and Eagle vehicles were marketed primarily by former AMC dealers.

1358,/wiki/GoldenEye_007_(handheld_LCD_game),"Both game variants are based on the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye and loosely follow its plot. Due to their rudimentary design, neither game is capable of a fleshed-out story, although details are covered in their respective instruction manuals. In both James Bond is sent to prevent his former friend Alec Trevelyan from using the GoldenEye satellite weapon to cripple Europe.
The game-pad variant of Tiger Electronics' GoldenEye 007 utilizes their standard form-factor of a centrally-located LCD screen, flanked by directional controls and action buttons (kick, Q, punch and fire) in the lower left and right hand sides, respectively. Underneath the display are off, sound, pause and start/on keys. Players move left and right attacking enemies by kicking, punching or shooting (both on foot and using a tank). The character can jump with 'up' (apparently intended to be Q's rappelling belt-buckle), but the 'down' arrow key does nothing. A more powerful attack is also available in the form of a Q-Branch class-4 pen grenade which can wipe out all enemies currently on the screen. There are five stages, during which 007 confronts assassin Xenia Onatopp and drives a tank (which can 'move' to three different sprite locations in the left, middle and right of the screen). As with the 'Grip games' variant, all the game's graphics are fixed in place. Illusion of movement is created by sequentially flashing objects between their possible states. Backgrounds for the games are static drawings, layered behind the ""moving"" graphics which are transparent when not in use.

1361,/wiki/Aston_Martin_V8,"The Aston Martin V8 Vantage Series II was hailed at its 1977 introduction as ""Britain's First Supercar"" for its 170 mph (270 km/h) top speed. Its engine was shared with the Lagonda, but it used high-performance camshafts, increased compression ratio, larger inlet valves and bigger carburettors mounted on new manifolds for increased output. Straight-line performance was the best of the day, with acceleration from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 5.3 seconds, one-tenth of a second quicker than the Ferrari Daytona. Notably, it was featured in the 1987 film The Living Daylights and the Craig era in the 2020 film No Time To Die. 
The first series had 375 hp (280 kW), and series specific details such as a blanked bonnet vent and a separate rear spoiler. 38 of these were built (plus 13 ""Cosmetics"" for the US). The Oscar India (for October 1, the date of introduction) version, introduced in late 1978, featured an integrated tea-tray spoiler and smoother bonnet bulge. Inside, a black leather-covered dash replaced the previous walnut. The wooden dashboard did find its way back into the Vantage during the eighties, giving a more luxurious appearance. The Oscar India version also received a slight increase in power, to 390 hp (291 kW). This line was produced, with some running changes, until 1989. From 1986 the engine had 405 hp (302 kW).
The Vantage name had previously been used on a number of high-performance versions of Aston Martin cars, but this was a separate model. Although based on the Aston Martin V8, numerous detail changes added up to a unique driving experience. One of the most noticeable features was the closed-off hood bulge rather than the open scoop found on the normal V8. The grille area was also closed off, with twin driving lights inserted and a spoiler added to the bootlid.
The 1986–1989 580X was a performance package, with bigger carburetors and Nimrod racing-type heads, the same 437 hp (326 kW) V8 as fitted to the limited-edition V8 Zagato. 16-inch (406-mm) wheels were also now fitted. If this wasn't enough, a 450 hp (336 kW) 6.3 litre version was also available from Aston Martin, and independents offered a 7 litre version.
304 Series 2 coupés were built, and 192 Volantes (in spite of only having been officially introduced in 1986, near the end of production). Of the Cosmetic Vantage (for the US), 14 Series 2 coupés and 56 Volantes were built. Cosmetic Vantages were built for the United States market – they lacked the powerful Vantage engine but retained the Vantage name, and the look was changed with a flattened hood. From 1980 they featured DOT-approved 5 mph (8 km/h) safety bumpers front and rear. Most of these cars have since been retrofitted with full power, European spec engines.
Alongside the Vantage saloon, ‘Britain’s first supercar’ could be had as a steroid-enhanced convertible. It came with the same luxuries as the ‘ordinary’ Volante, but also trumpeted the 5.3-litre Vantage-spec engine. The USA was desperate for a new high-performance drophead coupé – Aston hadn’t built one since 1970 – so this breeze machine was keenly received there. That’s where the vast majority ended up, making them a rare sight in Europe and their homeland...although James Bond managed to get hold of one for 1987’s The Living Daylights.
The film reunites Bond with British car maker Aston Martin. Following Bond's use of the Aston Martin DBS in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the filmmakers turned to the Lotus Esprit in 1977s The Spy Who Loved Me, which reappeared four years later in For Your Eyes Only. Despite the iconic status of the submersible Lotus however, 007's Aston Martin DB5 was recognised as the most famous of his vehicles. As a consequence, Aston Martin returned with their V8 Vantage. According to special effects supervisor, John Richardson, the decision to use Aston Martin occurred late into production, resulting in problems obtaining vehicles. With an 18 month waiting list for Aston Martin's V8 Vantage Volante, the production team sourced and bought three used Vantages for filming. While one was being outfitted with gadgets, another stunt vehicle began filming the chase scene in Austria.
For The Living Daylights a total of 11 cars were used, though only three of which were real drivable vehicles. One was an unmodified Vantage used for filming scenes with Timothy Dalton, the second was a stunt car and the third was dubbed a ""special effects car"", complete with missiles and rocket booster. Aside from one other vehicle which was little more than a steerable chassis without an engine, the rest were fiberglass mock-ups produced at Pinewood. At the beginning of the film, the car is first introduced as a V8 Volante (convertible). The car used in these scenes was a Volante owned by Aston Martin Lagonda chairman, Victor Gauntlett. To allow for the transition from the Volante to the hardtop saloons used later in the movie, Q-Branch is shown to have fitted Bond's Volante with a hardtop (it has been ""winterised""). Effectively transforming the Volante into a saloon car for the benefit of the audience.
The V8 Vantage Series II returns in the No Time To Die film where the producers brought back Dalton’s car, including the DB5, along with two new Aston Martins like the Valhalla and the DBS Superleggera.
As with previous Q-Branch vehicles, all the Vantage's ""optional extras"" were armed and operated by switches concealed in the center arm rest.

1362,/wiki/Felix_Leiter_(Cec_Linder),"Felix Leiter is a fictional American CIA intelligence operative. Based on the literary character created by Ian Fleming, Leiter appears for the second time in EON Productions' 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger and was portrayed by Canadian actor Cec Linder. He was the second of seven men to play the iconic role of Leiter officially on screen.
After the pre-credit sequence, Felix Leiter travels to Bond's hotel in Miami, where he finds him getting a massage from a girl, Dink. Leiter tells Bond about Auric Goldfinger and when his friend asks where he is, the CIA agent points him out just emerging from the hotel for his daily card game.
Felix Leiter is seen with a couple of times throughout the film checking on Bond's progress and making sure he does not require his help. 
Towards the end of the film, Leiter and Johnny at the CIA play a crucial role in the attack on Fort Knox, and it's one of his colleagues that stops the atomic bomb with only seven seconds to spare.

1365,/wiki/Hai_Fat,"Hai Fat was a fictional multi-millionaire industrialist and employer of assassin Francisco Scaramanga. He was the secondary antagonist in the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun and was portrayed by late actor Richard Loo. The character would later appeared in the James Bond 007 tabletop role-playing game.
A multi-millionaire Thai industrialist, Hai Fat is the owner of Hai Fat Enterprises. Prior to the film's events, a British scientist named Gibson is employed by Hai Fat to develop a solar energy device capable of solving the world's ongoing energy crisis. With the help of his construction company, a highly efficient solar power plant is constructed on an island owned by Hai Fat's junior partner and personal assassin, Francisco Scaramanga.
However, following its completion, Gibson attempts to return to Britain, bargaining for immunity with a critical component of the power plant: the Solex Agitator unit. With Gibson having outlived his usefulness, Hai Fat dispatches Scaramanga to assassinate the scientist and recover the Solex.
After meeting with his British contact at a Hong Kong strip club, Gibson is assassinated by Scaramanga and his invention stolen from the crime scene by the assassin's diminutive assistant Nick Nack. With the help of Gibson's contact, Hip, James Bond surmises that Hai Fat employed the ""Man with the Golden Gun"" to murder Gibson and proceeds to investigate the industrialist at his Thai home.
After scaling the estate's walls, Bond introduces himself to Hai Fat as Scaramanga, assuming that the two men never met during their dealings. Aware of his identity, the millionaire plays along with 007's ruse and invites him to dinner later that evening. Upon returning to the estate for the meal at the appointed time, Bond is set upon by Nick Nack and two sumo wrestlers, who eventually overpower him and prepare to deliver the final blow, with Nick Nack preparing to stab Bond in the throat with a trident. Suddenly, they are interrupted by Hai Fat, who insists that they move Bond to the martial arts school that he owns, rather than allowing him to be killed in his home.
After Bond escapes from the martial arts school, Hai Fat attempts to flee, prefering to lay low rather than further jeopardizing his substantial investment in Gibson's solar technology. As he makes the required preparations, he instructs Scaramanga to return the Solex to the power plant and stay there until receiving further orders. As the assassin quickly assembles the infamous Golden Gun from his personal belongings, Hai Fat reminds him of his subordinate position and demands that he keep out of his business.
Stating that he regrets employing Scaramanga, the industrialist notes that while Bond is unaware of the assassin's identity and presence in Bangkok, he is very much aware of his own identity. Scaramanga, his pistol now fully assembled and aimed at Hai Fat, retorts ""that's no problem"" before shooting the surprised man in the chest. With his employer dead, Scaramanga takes the solex, power plant and Hai Fat Enterprises for himself, planning to sell Gibson's solar technology to the highest bidder - criminal or otherwise, or keep it to power his laser cannon. As for Hai Fat's corpse, he suggests that Ling Po puts it in the mausoleum he had been so proud of in life.

1366,/wiki/Grischka,"Circus PerformerGrischka was a fictional professional knife-thrower and assassin who starred alongside his twin brother Mischka in Octopussy's travelling circus. The villain appeared in EON Productions' 1983 film Octopussy, and was portrayed by Anthony Meyer.
Twin knife throwers Mischka and Grischka feature prominently in Octopussy's circus. Kamal Khan and General Orlov also secretly employ the pair as assassins. When Agent 009, disguised as a circus clown, steals a fake Fabergé egg from Octopussy's circus in East Berlin, Mischka and Grischka give chase. They eventually throw a knife into his back, fatally wounding him. 009's murder and the recovery of the fake Fabergé egg from his body bring James Bond to investigate.
In Karl Marx Stadt, Bond witnesses the knife throwing skills of the twins despite being told not to leave his seating with the Russians.
Later, on board Octopussy's train, Mischka uses a welding torch to attack Bond as he enters a car housing Khan's and Orlov's atomic bomb. Momentarily blinded, Bond pulls a lever just in time, bringing the circus' heavy cannon down on Mischka, instantly killing him. Bond then disguises himself in Mischka's clothes. When Grischka sees Khan's henchman Gobinda battling Bond, who is dressed in his brother's clothes, he realizes that his brother has been murdered. Bond and Grischka fight and fall off the train. Grischka pursues 007, pinning him to a cabin door with knives. Bond turns the tables on the vengeful twin by throwing one of Grischka's own knives into his stomach, avenging the murder of 009.

1376,/wiki/From_Russia_with_Love_(video_game),"The game was the last James Bond video game released by Electronic Arts before they lost the rights to Activision in 2006, as well as Sean Connery's last role before retirement and death.
The game begins with a standard pre-title sequence in which Elizabeth Stark, the British Prime Minister's daughter, is kidnapped by the criminal organisation Octopus while attending a party at the Palace of Westminster in London. Fortunately, British Secret Service agent James Bond was assigned to attend the party for just such an event, and he defeats Octopus and rescues Stark. After a title sequence, the action then moves to the grounds of a mansion owned by Octopus, where their assassin Red Grant stalks and garrotes a man posing as Bond. It is revealed that it was all part of a training exercise overseen by Rosa Klebb, a former agent of the KGB who has secretly defected to Octopus. Octopus has devised a plan to embarrass 007 for the off-screen death of their operative Dr. No. The plan involves the theft of a Soviet encoding machine known as the Lektor with the help of a defecting Soviet cipher clerk, Tatiana Romanova. Romanova, however, is being used by Octopus to lure James Bond into a trap; their ultimate goal is to let him obtain the Lektor and then ambush him for it, in the process killing him in a humiliating fashion.
In London, M informs Bond that Romanova has contacted their ""Station 'T'"" in Turkey, offering to defect with a Lektor – but the clerk said she will only defect to Bond, who she has allegedly become besotted with after reading his intelligence file. Bond then flies to Turkey, where station head Ali Kerim Bey delivers him an Aston Martin DB5 provided by Q Branch. As the pair drive back through Istanbul to Kerim's base of operations they are followed by a Soviet spy, who is blown up by Red Grant using a bazooka. Subsequently they find themselves attacked by the Soviet Army, who assume that they ordered the assassination. After fending off a raid on Station 'T', Bond and Kerim disguise themselves, steal an armed boat from a Russian facility and travel through the ancient cisterns under Istanbul to spy on the Russian consulate. They hear that the Lektor is to be locked in the vault, whilst an attack is mounted by KGB operative Krilencu on Kerim's gypsy allies.
Bond storms the adjacent Russian facility through the underground waterways and steals the plans for the consulate, escaping the cisterns by means of a stolen Russian jet pack. He meets up with Kerim Bey at the gypsy camp and fends off an attack led by Krilencu, during which a stealthy Red Grant saves 007 from narrowly being shot by the KGB operative. The round intended for Bond instead wounds Kerim, leading the pair to hunt down the fleeing Krilencu and kill him. When Bond returns to his hotel suite, he finds Romanova in bed waiting for him and discovers that the Lektor is locked in the consulate vault. She explains that she will meet him the next day at 12:45 in the consulate operations room, where she will provide him with the codes to the vault.
The following day, 007 arrives at the consulate and has Kerim's men create a distraction, allowing him to infiltrate the building. Bond meets up with the girl and the pair make their way to the consulate vault through waves of Soviet troops, who flood the consulate with gas to impede Bond's progress. Eventually they take the Lektor from the vault and, following a high-speed chase in one of Kerim's vehicles, the pair board the Orient Express. It is there that Red Grant gains 007's trust, posing as a British Secret Service operative sent by M to help, and boards the train. He shoots Kerim Bey in his compartment and proceeds to meet with Bond in the dining car. Grant holds him at gunpoint and explains Octopus' scheme to him. After failing to murder 007, Grant unleashes his men on Bond and escapes with Eva Adara and the Lektor device through the Zagreb train station. After a firefight, a defeated Grant stumbles onto the tracks, and is seemingly hit by a train.
Leaving Romanova in the protection of one of Kerim's sons, Bond follows Adara and the Lektor to a Soviet factory and smelting plant which is acting as a front for Octopus' operations. Stealing a jet pack from a downed Octopus pilot, Bond flies through the factory and demolishes the adjacent Octopus warehouses, eventually catching up with the fleeing Adara, who attempts to run him down on a motorbike. He knocks her from her bike and takes the Lektor from her, egressing from the facility in a stolen armoured car. Bond meets up with Tatiana shortly afterwards, pursued by Octopus operatives, and attempts to flee in a stolen patrol boat. The pair make it across the border and reach Venice. At their hotel, Rosa Klebb, disguised as a maid, attempts to steal the Lektor. She gets the drop on Bond, and holds him at gunpoint, but is hit around the head with the Lektor case by Tatiana. Dropping her sidearm, she attempts to kill Bond with a poisoned toe-spike, but ends up being shot by Romanova.
An unspecified amount of time later, Octopus steals a nuclear weapon and threatens to destroy London, unless a ransom of £100,000,000 is paid. Twenty-four hours later, 007 is dropped into Octopus' secretive island launch-site by parachute and attempts to stop their plan by infiltrating their secret base and destroying their organisation. After disarming the warhead, Bond encounters Grant once again in the facility's control centre. The assassin descends from the ceiling in an octopus-like apparatus. Bond attacks the war machine, and it eventually explodes. Grant crawls from the wreckage and, mocking 007's British principles, attempts to shoot him; only to be shot first, avenging slain ally Kerim Bey.
Unlike its predecessor, Everything Or Nothing, From Russia with Love features a third-person multiplayer deathmatch mode.
The game's soundtrack was composed by Christopher Lennertz. Additionally, Vic Flick, best known for playing the original guitar riff in The James Bond Theme announced that he contributed to Lennertz's score.
Many of the cast from the film, From Russia with Love, return in likeness. Sean Connery, the first official actor to portray James Bond in the EON Productions film series returned to the role for the first time in 22 years (previously the unofficial 1983 film, Never Say Never Again). Connery not only allowed for his likeness of Bond to be used (appropriately from the 1963 film), but also recorded all new voice work for the character. By the time of the game's production, he was one of the only surviving main cast members; Daniela Bianchi, also still alive, had retired from acting in the 1970s and her voice in the original film had been overdubbed anyway.

1377,/wiki/General_Dong,"Sangjang Dong was a fictional North Korean military officer allied to Gustav Graves. A supporting antagonist portrayed by actor, Sai-Kit Yung, the character first appeared in the 2002 James Bond film, Die Another Day, and was later seen in its accompanying novelization penned by Raymond Benson.
Along with General Han and General Li, Dong is invited over to Graves' Ice Palace for a demonstration: a new satellite called Icarus that can provide sunlight to areas of the world which lack it in order to promote agricultural development in cold climate countries. However, it turns out that Icarus was actually designed as a weapon to detonate mines placed along the De-Militarized Zone between North and South Korea, as Graves intends to create a path carved through the De-militarized zone so that all of Korea would be reunited by force under North control. To that end, Graves provides a secret demonstration to Dong, Li and Han by using the satellite to trace down and kill James Bond with a giant laser, though Bond manages to escape from being killed.
Following Graves' return to North Korea, Dong helpes him and the other generals form a coup against Graves' father General Moon by putting him under house arrest. Dong and the generals then watch as Graves shows Moon of his plot. However, Moon is outraged by this and grabs Han's gun in an attempt to shot Graves, only for the latter to stun him and shot him down in anger, something which Dong and the other generals didn't expect. Needless to say, Bond and his NSA partner Jinx breaks into the plane just as the former accidentally fires a bullet in one of the plane's windows, causing the cabin to lose pressure. Dong, along with Vlad and the generals, are blown out of the plane and fell to their deaths.

The novel takes place just over two months from the end of Moonraker, which ended with James Bond taking a small vacation. When Diamonds Are Forever begins, M instructs Bond to infiltrate a smuggling ring, which is running diamonds from African mines to the United States. Bond's job is to travel down the ""pipeline"" as far as he can and find out who is behind it all. Under the name of Peter Franks, a petty crook already known as a diamond smuggler, he meets a mysterious ""go-between"" named Tiffany Case with whom he falls in love. Bond discovers that the smuggling ring is being operated by a ruthless American gang called ""The Spangled Mob"", which is run by the brothers Jack Spang and Seraffimo Spang. Also part of the Spangled Mob are Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd -- two mysterious yet ruthless assassins.
As Bond learns throughout the novel, the pipeline begins in Africa where a dentist would pay miners to smuggle diamonds in their mouth which the dentist would extract during a routine appointment. From there, the dentist would take the diamonds and rendezvous with a German pilot who would transport the diamonds to London via helicopter. In London, Tiffany would get an assignment from a contact known only as ABC. She would then meet with ""the hire"" and explain to that person how to smuggle the diamonds to New York City. The ""hire"" is then instructed how to receive his payout, which is delivered via rigged gambling.
While undercover, Bond smuggles his diamonds into New York inside fake golf balls. He is given $1,000 and is instructed to bid on a horse named Shy Smile in Saratoga Springs to receive his full payoff. Bond learns from Felix Leiter (who has left the CIA due to injuries sustained in Live and Let Die and is working for Pinkerton's as a private detective) that the real Shy Smile is dead and that his identifying tattoo has been imprinted on another horse. They find that they are both investigating the same people and work together to turn the tables on the gig and get Shy Smile disqualified.
James Bond receives another $1,000 from the mob and is instructed to gamble four hands at The Tiara in Las Vegas -- a casino owned by Seraffimo Spang. After pressing his luck in The Tiara and turning his $5,000 payout into $20,000 in a game of roulette, Bond is driven off the road and is captured by the Mob and tortured, aboard Seraffimo's historic train in a recreated ghost town named ""Spectreville."" (Spectreville actually has no connection whatsoever to Bond's nemesis SPECTRE, which appears later in Thunderball.)
Bond manages to escape with the help of Tiffany Case, who has turned against the mob due to her strong feelings for Bond. (He had been trying to win her over with his charm since he met her.) They manage to escape the train and light it on fire, killing Seraffimo. They flee the mob to New York where they catch The Queen Mary to London. Unbeknownst, they are spotted and Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd board the same boat. Bond pieces together their presence on the boat but they had already captured Tiffany. Bond climbs down the side of the ship with a rope made from sheets and manages to overpower them, killing them both.
In Sierra Leone, Bond stakes out the known contact point for the mine dentist. Rufus Saye (the mysterious ""ABC"" contact Tiffany had in London) arrives. He has been closing the smuggling ring, eliminating everyone involved. Later, Bond goes to Africa to stop the beginning arm of the smuggling ring. The man tries to get away, but Bond stops him by shooting down his helicopter, effectively ending the smuggling ring.
Diamond smuggling was a topic of great interest to author Ian Fleming. In 1957, Fleming wrote a non-fiction book on the subject, titled The Diamond Smugglers, which was published in the same format as his Bond novels and, as a result, is often erroneously listed as a Bond book. Additionally, author Geoffrey Jenkins claims that he had collaborated with Fleming on the plot of a novel featuring James Bond and dealing with diamond smuggling, titled Per Fine Ounce. This book is claimed by numerous sources including The Bond Files by Andy Lane and Paul Simpson as being commissioned by Glidrose Productions. The book completed circa 1966 but was never published.

"
1384,/wiki/Felix_Leiter_(Jack_Lord),"Felix Leiter is a fictional American CIA intelligence operative. Based on the literary character created by Ian Fleming, Leiter appears for the first time in EON Productions' 1962 James Bond film Dr. No and was portrayed by the late American actor Jack Lord. He was the first of seven men to play the iconic role of Leiter officially on screen.
Jack Lord was the first Felix Leiter, appointed into the role for the first Bond film, Dr. No. EON Productions started filming the series out of the order written by Fleming (Fleming had started with Casino Royale, with Dr. No being the sixth novel). Leiter was not present in the Fleming novel, but the writers added the character to the film. Bond scholars Smith and Lavington consider Leiter to offer negligible help to Bond, largely because there is no role for him in the novel, a point with which continuation Bond author Raymond Benson agrees, noting that he is ""extraneous to the dramatic action"". Jeremy Black agrees, although points out that the inclusion of Leiter was a sign of American influence in the Caribbean.
When the role of Leiter was brought back for the third Bond film, Goldfinger, in 1964, Lord was again approached to play Leiter; according to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing with Sean Connery, a bigger role and more money to reprise the role. The producers instead decided to recast the role.
Lord's version of the story, which he told to a friend, was that he was offered a contract by Broccoli's company, which Lord called a ""no-bread contract."" That meant that for seven years, he could not do any other work except for the Bond films, ""not even a TV commercial or play,"" he remarked. He would get paid, but the salary was not much, and there was no guarantee they would ever cast him in any Bond film made during that period. He could have been collecting the meager pay, not be cast in a Bond film at all, and not be able to do any other work. Lord turned it down. Barbara Broccoli, when asked about it, said they don't have records from that time that mention this contract and she does not have any firsthand knowledge of it but - she added - if Lord himself said it, it has to be true.
Lord played Leiter in a ""swaggering"" fashion, according to Smith and Lavington, and they considered him ""excellent, an effective American version of James Bond."" Bond scholars Pfeiffer and Worrall agree, stating that Lord's was ""one of the most satisfying portrayals of Leiter"".

As a possible unreliable narrator, the veracity of her tale is unclear. Moneypenny relates that Craft was dispatched to Antibes, France in order to detain a member of the Russian Brotherhood responsible for the murder of five UK diplomats and two MI6 and CIA operatives. When she discovered that James Bond was also there, she correctly assumed that he had been sent for the same reason and, rather than fight him for the prize, she decided to forge an ""invisible partnership"" with the spy. She engineered a ""chance encounter"", avoiding a collision with a Vespa and falling into his arms. During dinner at their hotel, Bond unwittingly detained the Russians for her and Craft's CIA team secretly extracted them. One man avoided capture and broke into Bond's suite; spoiling their liaison.

1391,/wiki/Dmitri_Mishkin_(Tch%C3%A9ky_Karyo),"Mishkin was the Defence Minister of Russia in 1995 at the time of Russia re-organising itself after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He is present at a meeting in St. Petersburg where the disillusioned General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov  (Commander of the Russian Space Division) informed him and his advisers of the incident at Severnaya, during which the experimental GoldenEye satellite was fired upon the site. Ouromov blamed the Electo-Magnetic Pulse attack on Siberian separatists; however, Mishkin informs him that aside from technician Boris Grishenko, fellow programmer Natalya Simonova was the only other individual at Severnaya whose body was not found in the carnage. Mishkin does not accept the explanation and demands Ourumov further investigate the matter, to which Ourumov tenders his resignation, claiming his purported failure in the Severnaya massacre he does not deserve to be in command.
In the days that follow, Mishkin interrogates James Bond and Natalya Simonova inside the Military Intelligence Archives of St. Petersburg. Mishkin intends to have the two of them executed for terrorism and treason respectively, and demands to know the location of the GoldenEye. When 007 and Natalya tell the Minister the truth of everything that's happened so far, Mishkin begins to doubt Ourumov's loyalties and is surprised to learn that a second satellite remains active. General Ourumov then enters the room and confronts the Minister as being 'out of order'. Mishkin rebukes him, prompting Ourumov to take Bond's Walther PPK against Mishkin's protests. Having recognized Ourumov's treachery, Mishkin orders the general to be neutralized; however, Ourumov shoots the guard and then assassinates Mishkin with a shot to the head, intending to frame Bond for the murder.
In the GoldenEye novelization, Viktor Mishkin was the Russian Minister of Defense and served in the former palace of Czar Nicholas, which had become the Defense headquarters. After the top secret Severnaya facility was destroyed by unknown perpetrators, Viktor held a meeting with General Arkady Ourumov, head of the Severnaya Station, who told him it was surely the work of Siberian separatists. Skeptical of this due to there being two survivors, Mishkin asked him to look deeper into the matter. Later on, missiles were fired over St. Petersburg that led Viktor to the stolen Tigre helicopter and two people whom he believed to be responsible for the destruction of Severnaya. While questioning them, they informed him that Ourumov had destroyed Severnaya, shortly before the general came in and tried to deny the claims. After Mishkin showed skepticism, Ourumov shot and killed him.
In the 1997 video game GoldenEye 007, Dmitri Mishkin arrives at the statue park to personally take both Bond and Natalya into custody shortly after Janus has destroyed the stolen Pirate helicopter. Later he again appears at the Military Intelligence Archives in St. Petersburg. During the shootout against Ourumov's men, Bond confronts Mishkin who is taking cover from the firefight in a safe room. Mishkin accepts the evidence of Ourumov's deceit, and gives Bond access to the flight recorder of the stolen helicopter which proves that Ourumov and Janus were responsible for the attack on Severnaya. Mishkin then flees the Archives to inform the Defense Ministry of Ourumov's treachery. He presumably survives and escapes to the authorities.

1392,/wiki/Everything_or_Nothing_(Soundtrack),"The soundtrack for Everything or Nothing was released on November 17, 2003 by Electronic Arts. soundtrack includes a full-length rendition of the James Bond theme. The in-game music was composed by composer Sean Callery, with additional music by Jeff Tymoschuk. Later in 2006, Electronic Arts published Callery's score appeared for sale exclusively on Rhapsody.
Sean Callery hints at his electro-orchestral tendencies here, but largely stays faithful to the melodies of the original. He waits till the main gameplay sequences to really assert his identity. For example, on ""To Arms"", he combines the exuberant orchestrations and punchy brass typical of David Arnold, with various percussive elements and electronic distortions typical of his 24 scores. The result has an enormous impact in the game and serves as some of the series' most appealing music on a stand-alone basis too.
While Everything or Nothing didn't receive a widespread music release, Sean Callery clearly intended the music to stand on its own. From a functional perspective, ""Silent Ascension"" enhances the infiltration feel of the game's stages with its electro-orchestral ambient soundscaping. However, it is also quite satisfying on a stand-alone level, thanks to Callery's creative use of solo and tutti strings. ""Kiss Kiss Fight"" is another impressive fusion of orchestral and contemporary elements that brings genuine chaos and intensity to the action sequences. ""Freefall"" turns the volume up a few notches and proves to be a gigantic action cue.
While most of the tracks on the score are electro-orchestral fusions, there is still plenty of diversity within. For example, the fusion of ""Tunisia"" introduces various Spanish instruments and tonalities, culminating in a fantastic interlude at the 0:42 mark. It's a very entertaining depiction. ""Egyptian Descent"" further focuses on regional elements — this time Arabian instruments and vocals — but includes the hook of the James Bond theme as well. It comes together surprisingly well. A further highlight is ""Restoration"", a more cinematic entry that depicts the antagonist in a stereotypical but exciting way with Russian choir.

The 32-page comic follows the movie script and most of the characters are drawn to resemble their screen counterparts. Some deviations are found, such as having Professor Dent trying to shoot James Bond before getting killed, and Dr. No being electrocuted instead of drowned. The original British cover depicted Dr. No, as well as the scene Bond and Honey Ryder meet the tank disguised as a dragon.
It was first published in the United Kingdom in Classics Illustrated #158A, being later reprinted in Detective Stories by Dell Publishing through Europe. For the US publishing by DC Comics, the comic was censored, deleting all racial skin color and dialogue thought to be demeaning. It also received a different cover, by Bob Brown, depicting a scene from the climax where Bond confronts Dr. No in the control room. The inside front cover included photos from the film, and the inside back cover had brief biographies of Bond and Fleming. The release in Showcase #43 (March 1963) - a comic series that usually focused on superhero stories - went mostly ignored. The next attempt at an American-published James Bond comic would not be made until the adaptation of For Your Eyes Only by Marvel Comics in 1981.

1395,/wiki/Ash,"The following content is suspected to be plagiarism. Please confirm its source. Confirmed plagiarism must be completely removed and rewritten to comply with James Bond Wiki policy. Give your opinion on this article's talk page.
Logan Ash was a fictional American intelligence operative employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as well as an undercover mole working with the terrorist Lyutsifer Safin. Portrayed by American actor Billy Magnussen, he served as a secondary antagonist in the 2021 James Bond film No Time to Die.
MI6 agent Nomi is sent after Ash once his betrayal is revealed by Bond, tracking him to Norway. Bond is informed of Ash's location while visiting his former lover Madeleine Swann and their daughter Mathilde and realizes that Ash is near his location and is tracking him. He drives away with Swann and Mathilde and is pursued by Ash and a convoy of armed men. The chase continues into the forest, where Bond directs Swann and Mathilde to hide before running away firing his gun to attract Ash's attention. Ash falls for the deception and follows the gunshots, getting most of his men shot by Bond. Ash tries to kill Bond personally, with his driver attempting to run him down while Ash shoots at him; however, the car misses and flips over, leaving Ash seriously injured. He is able to drop out of the car but is unable to move any further, observing that the car is only being held up by a slowly breaking sapling and begging Bond to help him and calling him his ""brother"". Bond replies: ""I had a brother. His name was Felix Leiter,"" before shoving the car downward, breaking the sapling and causing it to fall and crush Ash to death, thus avenging Leiter's death.
Despite Ash's death, Bond realizes too late that Safin only sent Ash to distract him so that he could capture Swann and Mathilde himself.
At first, Logan Ash seems like an eager and enthusiastic newcomer who really admires James. However, this turns out to be a cover for the fact that he's really a mole for Safin, and when his cover is blown, he quickly turns on him and Felix. From that point on, he shows a much more smug, arrogant and all-around unpleasant personality. That said, even though he may have not had any qualms with killing him, he may have still genuinely respected James since he remarks to Obruchev in the helicopter after leaving him to die on the sinking ship that he really did admire him. Plus, after James did unwillingly played his part in Safin's plan by retrieving Obruchev, he made a strong effort to convince him the mission was over and prevent him from extracting information out of Obruchev. While this was obviously at least partly because he didn't want his cover to be blown, it's also very possible that he preferred to avoid having to kill him or Felix, especially due to his admiration for the former, and only did so because he was forced to due to the circumstances. He also shows a slightly cowardly side in the face of death, as evidenced by him begging for James' help and trying to appeal to him by calling him ""brother"" even though he previously killed Felix and tried to kill him twice.

1400,/wiki/Casino_Royale_(film),"Casino Royale is the twenty-first film in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions. It served as a series reboot, resetting its continuity to the start of Bond's career as a 00 and was the first to feature Daniel Craig as 007. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and adapted for the screen by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis.
Based on the 1953 novel Casino Royale by Ian Fleming, it is the first Bond film to take its title from an Ian Fleming novel or short story since 1987's The Living Daylights, and the first to be directly based on any of Fleming's writing's since 1989's Licence to Kill (although several films in the interim, such as the preceding Die Another Day, had incorporated some story elements from Fleming). It is also considered to be the first more-or-less faithful adaptation of a full-length Fleming novel since 1973's Live and Let Die as all the films in the interim had either only used selected elements from Fleming's novels, were based upon short stories (requiring substantial expansion), or were original works. This film marks the third screen-adaptation of Casino Royale, which was previously a 1954 television episode and a 1967 film spoof; however, as an EON production, the 2006 release is considered the only ""official"" adaptation of Fleming's novel.
In the film, Bond must defeat criminal banker Le Chiffre in a high-stakes game of poker to thwart his criminal organisation from funding terrorists. He is aided by CIA agent Felix Leiter and HM Treasury liaison Vesper Lynd.
In Prague, Czech Republic, James Bond has tracked down an MI6 section chief, Dryden, who was selling secrets to enemies for profit. They chat about what it takes to be a Double-O agent (one of the requirements is making two kills) and Bond casually tells Dryden that his espionage contact, Fisher died, and ""Not well."" Intercut with the conversation are black and white scenes of Bond and Dryden's contact fighting in a men's room. Bond finally pushes the man's face into an overflowing sink and holds him there until he falls to the floor, apparently dead.
Dryden points a gun at Bond. ""Shame. We barely got to know each other."" He pulls the trigger, but James has removed the ammunition from the weapon. ""I know where you keep your gun. I suppose that's something."" Dryden continues to taunt Bond, asking him if he felt any remorse or guilt over killing Fisher. Bond remains passive, his face expressionless. Dryden says that Bond ""needn't worry, the second is--"" at which point Bond kills Dryden. Bond puts his pistol away saying, ""Yes, considerably."" (Though not said explicitly, Bond found the killing of Dryden, his second such kill, ""considerably"" easier than the first.) In flashback, Fisher recovers from Bond's attempt to drown him and picks up his pistol. The frame instantly shifts to the series' iconic ""gun barrel"" sequence. Bond spins around and shoots the man. Blood runs down the frame, prompting the opening titles.
The scene shifts to Uganda, where the terrorist group known as the Lord's Resistance Army is meeting with Le Chiffre, a private banker to terrorist groups around the world. The broker for the deal is a Mr. White, who invests their money and manipulates stocks so they get a 100% return on the investment. The Lord's Resistance Army, represented by a man named Steven Obanno, agree to allow the money to be loaned to Le Chiffre for his nefarious purposes.
In Madagascar, Bond is working with another MI6 agent, Carter, monitoring a terrorist, Mollaka, who is gambling on a fight between a cobra and a mongoose. Carter, who is inexperienced, is exposed after Mollaka gets a cell phone call and the terrorist bolts from the scene. Bond chases Mollaka, who is an experienced ""free runner"", who leads Bond through a construction site, onto several cranes and finally to the Nambutu embassy where he seeks asylum. Bond charges into the embassy, in direct contravention of international law and his orders, and catches Mollaka. Bond fights his way through the halls of the embassy and finds himself surrounded by armed guards. The ambassador appears and orders Bond to let Mollaka go. Bond shoots Mollaka and a nearby gas tank and escapes in the explosion. He also steals the backpack Mollaka was carrying. Searching through the backpack, he finds a cell phone and a bomb. Bond examines the man's messages briefly, seeing one with an American phone number and the word ""ellipsis."" Bond keeps the phone.
Back at MI6, M is furious that 007's violent actions were caught on tape at the Nambutu embassy. Bond later sneaks into M's home and hacks her top-level clearance so he can trace where the cell phone call originated from. When M enters, she is startled and lectures him on proper protocol and conduct. She thought it was a mistake to give him 00 status. Bond assures her that ""the life expectancy of a 00 is brief, so your mistake will be short-lived."" M tells him that ""arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand-in-hand"" and she wanted him to take his ego out of the equation when on a mission. She also tells him to go on a brief vacation until she can decide how best to deal with him. As Bond goes to leave, M tells Bond to never break into her house again (something he will do again in Skyfall).
Bond had discovered that the call to Mollaka originated in the Bahamas, so he goes there to investigate who made the call and why. He ends up finding a middleman, Alex Dimitrios, who was working for Le Chiffre and that he was hired to find someone who could carry out a task for Le Chiffre. Bond meets Dmitrios and plays poker with him, winning his 1964 Aston Martin in the process. Bond uses the Aston to finagle a romantic evening with Dmitrios' spurned wife, Solange, to get information about her husband. She tells Bond that Dmitrios is going to Miami.
Bond follows him there where he confronts Dimitrios, after seeing him put a bag away for someone to pick up later. Bond kills Dimitrios when he's held at knifepoint; however, the bag goes missing and Bond follows the man, Carlos, hired for Mollaka's job. Bond follows Carlos to Miami International Airport, where he pulls a security uniform out of the bag and puts it on. He slips into the secure area of the airport and Bond follows him, having figured out ""ellipsis"" was the security code to get through the door. M calls Bond to tell him Le Chiffre will have Carlos destroy the prototype for a large airline named Skyfleet. The prototype is the largest passenger aircraft in the world and destroying it will bankrupt Skyfleet. Carlos sets off the emergency sprinkler system in the building to cause a diversion, forcing everybody out of the airport and slips out onto the tarmac. Carlos attaches an explosive charge disguised as a keyring to a refueling tanker and starts driving it towards the plane. However, Bond manages to leap onto the tanker. The two have a vicious fight all the way around the runways while being chased by the Miami-Dade Police. Eventually, Carlos leaps off the truck, and Bond is barely able to stop the tanker from hitting the plane. Carlos smiles as Bond is arrested and sets off the charge. However, Bond had discovered Carlos' small explosive device & attached it to Carlos' belt during the melee, and Carlos ends up killing himself by accident.
Upon returning to Nassau, Bond discovers that Solange had been murdered, when MI6 find her drowned corpse in a fishing boat net. M explains she was tortured and killed by Le Chiffre because she was the only one left alive and he assumed she talked. Le Chiffre's plan was to ""short-sell"" hundreds of millions of dollars in Skyfleet stock and, in destroying their prototype, cause their stock to plummet and send them into bankruptcy. Thanks to Bond, Le Chiffre loses over $101 million dollars. Now a marked man, Le Chiffre must find another way to earn the money back so his investors will not kill him. He sets up a high stakes poker match ain Montenegro for ten players, with entry fees at $10 million each plus a $5 million buy back should they lose all their money. M informs Bond of the poker game at the Casino Royale, which is in Montenegro, and agrees to let Bond continue the mission since he's the best poker player in the service. M also implants a homing device in Bond's left forearm so she can track him anywhere.
The British Government put up the money and send along Vesper Lynd, a representative of HM Treasury, to monitor Bond and give a go, no-go should he lose the money. They talk on the train about each other, Vesper commenting on his cold nature and Bond remarking on how Vesper is retentive. Upon arriving they pose as a married couple and meet René Mathis, their contact in Montenegro. Each poker player has their money in a Swiss bank in Escrow while they play, and each one has a password to keep the money secured. Vesper has the account number, but only 007 knows the password. On the first hand, 007 loses a chunk of cash to figure out how Le Chiffre bluffs (his physical ""tell"" involves him placing his left hand near his wounded eye); however, Vesper is not at all impressed, thinking Bond is inept. After a lengthy round of hands, a break is called. Bond places a tracking device in Le Chiffre's inhaler and takes Vesper back to their room.
Le Chiffre is called back to his room by his girlfriend, Valenka. However, he was confronted by Obanno and his henchman, demanding his money back. They threaten to cut off Valenka's arm; however, Le Chiffre doesn't acquiesce, even with this mutlation. Out in the hallway, Bond hears Valenka screaming. He quickly grabs Vesper and they kiss in the stairway entrance to cover themselves. Obanno's henchman notices Bond's earpiece and attacks them both. The fight takes them into the stairwell, where the henchman gets thrown off the stairwell to his death, and Bond and Obanno have a knock-down drag-out fight all the way down the stairwell. Finally landing on the bottom, Bond gets Obanno into a chokehold. Obanno tries to reach for Bond's gun, but Vesper smashes it out of his hands. Bond kills Obanno and orders Vesper to contact Mathis, who sets up a man to take the fall for the dead bodies by placing them in the man's car trunk. Bond finishes the poker session, but he returns to the room to find Vesper shaking uncontrollably in the shower from the fight. He holds on to her and comforts her.
The next day, during the continuing poker game, Bond loses all his money to Le Chiffre after misreading a bluff and admits to Vesper that he made a mistake. Vesper won't give him the buy back money, saying he's going to lose it. Furious, 007 goes after Le Chiffre but is stopped by one of the other poker players, Felix Leiter, an agent sent by the CIA to the poker match to catch Le Chiffre. Leiter tells 007 that he's doing poorly himself in the game and that he'll back Bond to re-enter the game; Leiter believes that Bond can beat Le Chiffre. In return, Bond will give Le Chiffre to the CIA. Bond slowly builds his bank again and once again becomes a threat to Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre has Valenka poison Bond's martini with digitalis, causing Bond to suffer severe tachycardia. Bond goes to his car, distressed and, communicating with medical specialists at MI6 Headquarters, is about to use the defibrillator when he sees the connection isn't plugged in and passes out. Vesper arrives, fixes the defibrillator kit and shocks him back to life. Bond, shaken, returns to the game. The final hand of the game is down to four players, including Bond and Le Chiffre, who all go ""all in"", betting their remaining money, driving the ""pot"" amount to well over $120 million. One man has a flush, while another has a full house. Le Chiffre has a higher full house and is about to take the entire pot. Bond reveals he has a straight flush and wins the game and all the money.
Bond has dinner with Vesper, who receives a call from Mathis stating that Le Chiffre has been apprehended by the CIA. Vesper leaves the dining room; seconds later, Bond realizes she's in danger. Vesper is kidnapped by Le Chiffre. Bond races after them in his Aston Martin, but has to swerve violently when he sees Vesper lying bound in the road. The car rolls several times, destroying it and injuring Bond, rendering him unconscious. Le Chiffre and his cronies take him, remove his homing implant and take him and Vesper to a nearby tramp steamer. Bond is stripped naked and bound to a chair with the seat removed, leaving his testicles exposed. Le Chiffre uses a large knotted rope, striking Bond's scrotum, demanding the password for the account the winnings have been secured in. Bond refuses, despite Le Chiffre's threats to kill him and Vesper. Le Chiffre finally draws a knife and is about to castrate Bond when gunshots are heard outside. The door opens and Mr. White, the broker from the first scene with Obanno, walks in. Le Chiffre pleads with him, saying he'll secure the money, to which White replies, ""Money isn't as important to our organization as knowing who to trust."" White shoots Le Chiffre in the forehead, killing him.
Bond wakes up in a hospital bed during a haze while he recovers. He talks to Mathis, whom he believes was responsible for his and Vesper's capture by Le Chiffre. MI6 agents appear, taze Mathis and drag him away. Vesper visits Bond and they confess their love for each other. The Swiss banker in charge of the winnings account visits and Bond gives Vesper the password to key in; the password is her own first name. 
Bond resigns from the service to go away with Vesper, and they sail to Venice, Italy where Vesper says she'll get the money and Bond will get the supplies for the trip. When M phones 007 about his resignation, she says that they need to talk about the money being returned to the British government first, which tips off 007 that Vesper was using him all along. 007 follows Vesper to a secret meeting where she turns the money over, in cash, to a man named Adolph Gettler. Gettler and a few of his men retreat to a building being renovated and a gunfight ensues. Bond shoots and ruptures the flotation bags that hold the building above water-level and fights with them all, killing them. He tries to save Vesper, locked in an old elevator, but is unable to after she commits suicide by drowning herself. Bond recovers her body and takes her above water but is unable to revive her. Mr. White, who'd been watching the scene, is seen leaving with the suitcase full of money.
Sitting on the sailboat he and Vesper had been vacationing on, Bond talks to M, who informs him that Vesper had a boyfriend who was being held by Le Chiffre's organization, Quantum. She had intended to pay off Le Chiffre's associates with the money to secure her boyfriend's release. M believes that there are no further leads, that the ""trail has gone cold."" Bond examines Vesper's cell phone and finds the phone number of Mr. White, which he theorized she left for him on purpose. At Lake Como in Northern Italy, White arrives at a palatial estate. After he exits his car, he receives a phone call from someone telling him they ""need to talk."" Asking who the caller is, White is suddenly shot in the leg by a sniper. He falls to the ground and crawls toward the house. As he tries to climb the stairs and the familiar Bond theme begins to play, Bond appears, carrying a cell phone and an HK rifle. As White looks up defiantly, Bond says ""The name's Bond. James Bond.""

The film holds a 95% rating, based on 220 reviews, on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus that, ""Casino Royale disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent James Bond outings, and Daniel Craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for: a caustic, haunted, intense reinvention of 007.""

1401,/wiki/Diamonds_Are_Forever_(book),"Diamonds are Forever, published in 1956, is the fourth James Bond novel written by Ian Fleming. It was adapted into the seventh film in the James Bond film franchise starring Sean Connery as James Bond.
The novel takes place just over two months from the end of Moonraker, which ended with James Bond taking a small vacation. When Diamonds Are Forever begins, M instructs Bond to infiltrate a smuggling ring, which is running diamonds from African mines to the United States. Bond's job is to travel down the ""pipeline"" as far as he can and find out who is behind it all. Under the name of Peter Franks, a petty crook already known as a diamond smuggler, he meets a mysterious ""go-between"" named Tiffany Case with whom he falls in love. Bond discovers that the smuggling ring is being operated by a ruthless American gang called ""The Spangled Mob"", which is run by the brothers Jack Spang and Seraffimo Spang. Also part of the Spangled Mob are Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd -- two mysterious yet ruthless assassins.
As Bond learns throughout the novel, the pipeline begins in Africa where a dentist would pay miners to smuggle diamonds in their mouth which the dentist would extract during a routine appointment. From there, the dentist would take the diamonds and rendezvous with a German pilot who would transport the diamonds to London via helicopter. In London, Tiffany would get an assignment from a contact known only as ABC. She would then meet with ""the hire"" and explain to that person how to smuggle the diamonds to New York City. The ""hire"" is then instructed how to receive his payout, which is delivered via rigged gambling.
While undercover, Bond smuggles his diamonds into New York inside fake golf balls. He is given $1,000 and is instructed to bid on a horse named Shy Smile in Saratoga Springs to receive his full payoff. Bond learns from Felix Leiter (who has left the CIA due to injuries sustained in Live and Let Die and is working for Pinkerton's as a private detective) that the real Shy Smile is dead and that his identifying tattoo has been imprinted on another horse. They find that they are both investigating the same people and work together to turn the tables on the gig and get Shy Smile disqualified.
James Bond receives another $1,000 from the mob and is instructed to gamble four hands at The Tiara in Las Vegas -- a casino owned by Seraffimo Spang. After pressing his luck in The Tiara and turning his $5,000 payout into $20,000 in a game of roulette, Bond is driven off the road and is captured by the Mob and tortured, aboard Seraffimo's historic train in a recreated ghost town named ""Spectreville."" (Spectreville actually has no connection whatsoever to Bond's nemesis SPECTRE, which appears later in Thunderball.)
Bond manages to escape with the help of Tiffany Case, who has turned against the mob due to her strong feelings for Bond. (He had been trying to win her over with his charm since he met her.) They manage to escape the train and light it on fire, killing Seraffimo. They flee the mob to New York where they catch The Queen Mary to London. Unbeknownst, they are spotted and Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd board the same boat. Bond pieces together their presence on the boat but they had already captured Tiffany. Bond climbs down the side of the ship with a rope made from sheets and manages to overpower them, killing them both.
In Sierra Leone, Bond stakes out the known contact point for the mine dentist. Rufus Saye (the mysterious ""ABC"" contact Tiffany had in London) arrives. He has been closing the smuggling ring, eliminating everyone involved. Later, Bond goes to Africa to stop the beginning arm of the smuggling ring. The man tries to get away, but Bond stops him by shooting down his helicopter, effectively ending the smuggling ring.
Diamond smuggling was a topic of great interest to author Ian Fleming. In 1957, Fleming wrote a non-fiction book on the subject, titled The Diamond Smugglers, which was published in the same format as his Bond novels and, as a result, is often erroneously listed as a Bond book. Additionally, author Geoffrey Jenkins claims that he had collaborated with Fleming on the plot of a novel featuring James Bond and dealing with diamond smuggling, titled Per Fine Ounce. This book is claimed by numerous sources including The Bond Files by Andy Lane and Paul Simpson as being commissioned by Glidrose Productions. The book completed circa 1966 but was never published.

1413,/wiki/Alec_Trevelyan_(Sean_Bean),"Alec Trevelyan was born to a family of Lienz Cossacks. Following the Second World War, the anti-Bolshevik Cossack brigades whom had collaborated with the Germans fled from the advance of the Red Army. They surrendered to the British Army in Austria, believing they would join them and wage war against the Communists. However, British decided to forcibly repatriate them and their families to the Soviet Union, where many were promptly executed and the remainder were sent to Gulags including women and children. The Trevelyans survived the ordeal and Alec Trevelyan was born. Shortly afterward, however, his father committed murder-suicide; ""unable to let himself or [Alec's] mother live with the shame of it"". As with James Bond, Alec was now an orphan.
In one of life's ironies, the young Trevelyan was recruited by the British Secret Intelligence Service to be an agent of the government that had betrayed his parents. Although MI6 was aware of his background, they had reasoned that these events had happened so early in Trevelyan's life, that he would not be affected by them. Trevelyan rose through the ranks of MI6 to gain 00 status and the number 006. It was during this time that he became close friends with fellow MI6 agent 007, James Bond. His skill set included stealth, manipulation, superb skills in martial arts and hand-to-hand combat, expert marksmanship and also a talent in several languages. However, Trevelyan continued to harbor resentment towards the British for their perceived betrayal and began plotting his revenge.
In 1986, 006 is paired again with 007 and the two are tasked with destroying the Arkhangelsk chemical weapons facility. It is on this mission, conspiring with Soviet Colonel Arkady Ourumov, that Trevelyan stages his own death. In the course of the mission, the two are surrounded by Ourumov and his men into the main chamber of the facility and 006 is supposedly taken prisoner at gunpoint. Under the pretense of allowing Bond to surrender, Ourumov gives him ten seconds to come out. On reaching one, Alec is shot in the head. 007 manages to escape and succeeds in destroying the facility by setting limpet mines with a three minute fuse. Trevelyan had not anticipated that Bond would change the detonation fuse from the agreed upon six minutes. Although he narrowly escapes death, the right half his face is left horribly disfigured by the explosion.
Now supposedly dead, Trevelyan founds a criminal organization under the pseudonym of Janus (the two headed Roman god of beginnings and endings) and sets in motion a plan to take revenge against Britain. His scheme involves hijacking a secret Soviet space weapon, codenamed GoldenEye. With the weapon's control key in his possession and a duplicate control center in Cuba, Trevalyan plans to steal billions of dollars from the Bank of England and transfer the money to other organizations before erasing all of its financial records with an electromagnetic pulse generated by the GoldenEye satellite, concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy.
Assigned to investigate the detonation of one of the two GoldenEye satellites triggered by Ourumov and Trevelyan's henchwoman Xenia Onatopp, Bond travels to St. Petersburg, Russia in search of the culprits. To find Janus, Bond meets mafia head and ex-KGB officer Valentin Zukovsky. Although not aware of Janus' identity, Zukovsky reveals to 007 that Janus is a Cossack of Lienz. Through his criminal ties, the gangster arranges a meeting for Bond at the Grand Hotel Europe in St. Petersburg. Janus sends Onatopp to dispose of the spy but Bond manages to overpower the sadomasochist assassin and forces her to bring him to Janus at a memorial park. As Bond walks through the relics of the collapsed Soviet Union, he is approached by Janus, who reveals himself to be Alec Trevelyan. Not believing his eyes, Bond lowers his weapon. Trevelyan sarcastically asks whether 007 would like to make his typical witty comeback, but the spy is too shocked. He explains his motivations and casually mentions that he initially wanted to ask for Bond to join him, but deep down he knew that the British agent would be loyal to his country and not to his friend. Furious and disappointed, Bond attempts to shoot Alec; but is tranquilized before he can pull the trigger. 007 and Natalya Simonova (a witness to Trevelyan's scheme) are bound and placed in a stolen helicopter rigged to destroy itself. Bond is able to eject both of them out of the helicopter before it explodes.
Bond and Natalya are soon taken into custody by Russian soldiers. After attempting to frame Bond for the murder of the Russian Defense Minister Dmitri Mishkin, General Ourumov kidnaps Simonova and attempts to rendezvous at Trevelyan's armored train. Although pursued by 007 in a T-55 tank, Ourumov brings her aboard and the train departs. Trevelyan attempts to forcibly seduce Simonova, but is prevented by Bond's blockade of the track ahead. He orders the driver to ram the tank, resulting in its derailing. Trevelyan recovers from the impact and attempts to reacquire his firearm, but is prevented by Bond, who holds him at gunpoint. A standoff occurs between 007 and Trevelyan, who has Ourumov bring Natalya to the cabin as a bargaining chip. Bond tries to drive a wedge between Alec and Ourumov by revealing his associate's Cossack heritage. Ourumov's hesitation allows Bond to gain the upper hand; he shoots the General to his death, while Trevelyan and Onatopp flee from the carriage and lock all doors. As the villains escape by helicopter, they set the carriage to self-destruct with an ironic three-minute fuse.
Before escaping the train, Bond and Simonova track Trevelyan to a hidden satellite control center in the jungles of Cuba. After having shot down the pair's plane with a missile, the criminal mestermind sends Onatopp to search for survivors but the assassin is ultimately killed by 007. Infiltrating the control facility, Bond and Simonova separate; with Bond attempting to plant explosives while Simonova hacks the GoldenEye's guidance systems. Shortly after completing their objectives they are captured and brought to Trevelyan. Using his experience as a 00 operative, he casually disarms Bond's limpet mines. Realizing that the GoldenEye is about to re enter earth's atmosphere (which would cause the satellite burn up upon reent) due to Simonova's hacking Trevelyan have his programmer Boris Grishenko hack back into the system but unbeknowst to him, Grishenko begins fumbling with an explosive pen which Bond had been provided with by Q Branch. He unwittingly detonates the pen, destroying part of the control room; providing Bond and Simonova with an opportunity to escape.
Leaving Grishenko in the unenviable position of attempting to reverse Simonova's interference at gunpoint, Trevelyan proceeds to the Antenna itself to activate the satellite manually. 007 pursues him but Alec corners him above the satellite dish and engages him in a frenzied fist-fight. Although the two seem evenly matched, Trevelyan quickly overpowers his enemy. Exhausted, bloodied and virtually disabled by the duel, Trevelyan goads to James that he was always a better fighter than him. However, Bond grabs hold of and triggers a folding escape ladder to avoid being shot. Meanwhile, Alec calls for a helicopter to collect him from the antenna. Bond and Alec fight continuously, which ends with Alec choking James, smiling maniacally. Just as the helicopter pilot is taken hostage by Simonova, James uses the distraction to out think and overpower Trevelyan. Losing his footing, Trevelyan falls but is grabbed by Bond.
In revenge for Trevelyan's callous betrayal, letting go of Trevelyan's boot, 007 sends his former friend plummeting to the dish below. Although barely clinging to life after the initial fall, the falling debris from the disintegrating structure above finishes the job by crushing him to death. Later, the entire base explodes, killing Boris Grishenko and the rest of the Janus Crime Syndicate. This time, Alec Trevelyan, double agent, evil genius and James Bond's old friend and teammate stays dead.
In 1986, after arranging to fake his death, Trevelyan was sent with James Bond to a dam near Archangel port in the Soviet Union that M had assigned them to investigate due to suspicions that it was a chemical weapons facility. Trevelyan entered a maintenance shaft to set up a base of operations for himself and 007. After Bond had eliminated the guards on top of the dam, they entered the facility and placing explosives until Trevelyan was caught by Colonel Ourumov, who pretended to kill him in front of 007, who detonated the charges early and fled the facility. This left Trevelyan with the left side of his face deformed, and caused him to take up the name Janus.
By 1995, Janus had established himself as a powerful crime boss in Russia, with his only competition being Valentin Zukovsky. Trevelyan then planned to steal most of the world's money by digitally transferring funds to other bank accounts, and wiping the records of the transaction by hitting the bank with the GoldenEye. He sent his Lieutenants Xenia Onatopp and Ourumov to collect and test the weapon, with the help of their inside man Boris Grishenko. After their destruction of the Severnaya GoldenEye facility, it was discovered that an additional technician survived the blast. Trevelyan ordered her capture, and she was eventually brought in after she had been seen working with 007.
He came to rescue her, and destroyed the train on which Trevelyan lived in the process. He took Trevelyan and Onatopp hostage, but Alec negotiated to be traded for the other technician, Natalya Simonova. In the process, he was forced to kill Ourumov, who began to question his alliance to Trevelyan after learning of his Cossack heritage. The distraction allowed Alec and Onatopp to escape and set the train to explode. They then fled to Havana, Cuba where Boris Grishenko was waiting for them in the control room of a new GoldenEye facility. There, after Grishenko had put the plan into effect, Trevelyan discovered that 007 and Simonova were trying to break in to the facility on security cameras. After capturing 007, he put his past SIS skills to work by disarming the mines that the agent had placed around the control room. 007 however, detonated an explosive pen that caused fuel tanks in the room to explode, and escaped to try and sabotage the satellite dish. The two fought one another for a while, but 007's bomb in the dish went off, throwing Trevelyan off balance. 007 caught him as he fell out of instinct before letting Alec fall. When Trevelyan awoke from the fall, he could tell he was near death, but it got much worse when a piece of shrapnel from the dish impaled him.
In the 1997 Nintendo N64 video-game, GoldenEye 007, Trevelyan plays a very similar role to that in the film. He once again meets with Bond in the Chemical Warfare Facility and is 'killed' by Ourumov. In the Statue Park, ex-KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky arranges Bond's meeting with Janus at the Statue of Lenin. Bond stands by the statue and is soon confronted by Trevelyan and his bodyguards, where the traitorous spy informs Bond of the British government's betrayal towards his parents and how he plans to take revenge.
Bond then finds out that Trevelyan had kidnapped Natalya Simonova and has left her by the stolen Pirate helicopter, which is primed to explode in three minutes time. Before Bond can kill Trevelyan, he runs away and his bodyguards attempt to stop Bond from pursuing him.
Trevelyan reappears aboard his Converted Missile Train along with Xenia Onatopp and General Ourumov (who is holding Natalya at gunpoint). Bond kills Ourumov and saves Natalya, but Trevelyan and Xenia take this opportunity to escape. Trevelyan then travels to Cuba and attacks Bond in both the Janus Control Centre and the Subterranean Caverns, but Natalya manages to redirect the GoldenEye's path of alignment away from London while Bond destroys the master control console. Trevelyan then climbs to the Antenna Cradle suspended high above the control centre, where a back-up control console is situated. The villain uses this to realign the GoldenEye in a final attempt to destroy London, but Bond reaches the cradle himself and destroys the console. He then engages in a fierce gunfight with Trevelyan and chases him throughout the cradle, finally confronting his former ally on a small round platform and killing him.
In the Facility level, if one were to shoot Trevelyan at any point after meeting with him, he begins to attack the player, saying ""So, the golden boy is a traitor. How ironic James"", revealing his plans. However, this causes the player to fail the mission. 
The former ""00"" underwent the standard MI6 training procedure while working for ""Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and was physically on par with Bond himself. Even nine years after defecting from MI6, Trevelyan still managed to keep his body at its physical peak. Due to the rigorous training placed upon him, he was in perfect physical condition and had superb aim and agility while also being able to carry himself as refined and elegant. Trevelyan was a skilled leader and able to take command of the Janus Crime Syndicate and also has strategic talents when it comes to making plans for the future.
Alec Trevelyan was a cold-hearted psychopath. He was also immoral, resourceful, calculating, surreptitious and remarkably intelligent. Trevelyan had a dark, sarcastic and cynical sense of humor, going so far as to mock James for things he had already said - especially the things he said at the time that Trevelyan faked his own death. He was extremely sophisticated, in terms of speech, appearance, surroundings and equipment, his eccentricity only breaking at the time of his final confrontation with James Bond.
Trevelyan was cunning, pitiless and deceitful, with enough skill and confidence to double-cross his best friend and his employers at MI6 so that he could enact his revenge. He was extremely confident in his own talents, as he gloats to James that he was always better than him in a fight. Trevelyan was sadistic and immoral, taunting James about his scenario of 'Your friend, or the mission' when James confronts him on the train.
Trevelyan's dissonant serenity had limits: His self-control finally dissolves when his plans are foiled by Bond and Natalya, and he reacts violently to Boris Grishenko, going so far as to ruthlessly demand a soldier to kill Grishenko if he tried to escape. Also, he showed anger when participating in his shootout with Bond. This is possibly an element in his massive final fistfight with Bond, as both of them were on equal levels of anger and revenge, but Trevelyan still prevailed over pure skill and the will to turn on his old friend one last time.
Trevelyan was also an expert in hand to hand combat and was more than capable of holding his own against Bond during their climatic battle. His fighting style is based on cunning, stealth and psychological warfare. This is possibly due to his elite military training in advanced forms of unarmed combat and military strategy at MI6, and he possibly developed his skills even further over the next nine years and easily defeats Bond during their fight. He was also an expert with several firearms: He carries an AK-74 assault rifle during the assault on Arkhangelsk, and also wields a Davis Mp.4 k-9d Mk.9 automatic pistol during his duel with James Bond.
Trevelyan rather dramatically opted to dress himself in well tailored suits, mirroring 007's own tastes in fashion, although Trevelyan preferred darker colors. While Trevelyan was overseeing the Bank of England robbery, he wore a black combat suit similar to the one he wore during his 006 days.
When Trevelyan attempted to stage his own death at Arkhangelsk, the right side of his face was severely scarred in an explosion caused by Bond. This further deepened his hatred towards Bond, because Trevelyan believed that if Bond had set the detonation timers for six minutes instead of three, he would have escaped the facility unharmed. This further embittered him against Bond, but also inspired his code-name, Janus: The two-faced Roman god who rained fire down on those who betrayed him.
This, combined with his comments that his plan to destroy British electronic infrastructure and cripple the global economy as ""the price of betrayal,"" shows that Trevelyan held a particular hatred of treachery--albeit a self-serving hatred, given that he had no qualms about betraying Bond at Arkhangelsk.
Despite that they were probably very good friends in the past, especially with Trevelyan mentioning to Simonova, that he and James shared absolutely everything with each another, he makes several, quite cutting, personal remarks aimed at Bond as a person. The above quote might have been a reference to Bond's wife Teresa, who was tragically murdered on their wedding day in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, but the subject is not touched on again.  Earlier, he mockingly declared that no one but Moneypenny ""and a few sad-eyed resteraunteurs"" would attend Bond's memorial.  This is a trait which had never been seen to such an extent in previous villains. Trevelyan also belittles Bond's devotion to duty, stating that he had even considered inviting James to join in his scheme, but didn't, guessing that he would prioritize loyalty to MI6 over friendship. 
Sean Bean had previously auditioned for the role of James Bond in The Living Daylights. Sam Neill was also considered as were Mel Gibson, Mark Greenstreet, Lambert Wilson, Antony Hamilton, Findlay Light and Andrew Clarke. In addition, Pierce Brosnan - who would eventually play 007 in GoldenEye opposite Bean - was offered the role, but lost out due to his contractual obligations to Remington Steele. Despite his performance, the choice of Sean Bean to play a character with this background creates something of an enigma. The events which precipitated the death of Trevelyan's parents would have been around fifty years before those of Goldeneye, while Bean would only have been in his mid-thirties, making the actor far younger than his character. Originally, he was originally scripted as ""Augustus Trevelyan"" and envisaged as an older character and a mentor figure to Bond. Anthony Hopkins and Alan Rickman were reportedly sought for the role but both turned it down. After this, the part was rewritten as Bond’s peer.
Alec Trevelyan is believed to have been named after John Trevelyan (1903-1986), a former head of the then British Board of Film Censors. Under Trevelyan's stewardship, a number of the early Bond films had to have cuts to gain a A rating allowing for the film to be seen by children accompanied by an adult, as opposed to an X rating that would limit viewership to over 16s.
Allegedly, a version of Alec Trevelyan was considered by producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson to be brought back as a reoccurring antagonist during Daniel Craig's tenure as Bond. A new version of Trevelyan would eventually face Daniel Craig's Bond in the video game GoldenEye 007.

1414,/wiki/Dikko_Henderson_(Charles_Gray),"Arriving in Tokyo, James Bond is taken to the estate of British citizen Dikko Henderson, who had lived in the nation for 28 years. Henderson makes notes of a Japanese agent named Tiger Tanaka and of the spacecraft landing in Japan and suggests that someone there may be behind it, but is killed (stabbed in the back by an assassin) before saying anything further. Bond takes down one of the assassins and takes on his guise to ride with another associate unknowingly to Osato Chemicals and Engineering.
Henderson's apartment in Tokyo is an odd hybrid of old English comfort and Japanese style. ""Awfully fond of some of these old things...,"" he almost apologises to Bond about the clash of styles. He gave Bond a Vesper martini though it was stirred, not shaken. It is implied that Henderson served in the British Army during the Second World War, where he lost his right leg in Singapore in 1942.

1415,/wiki/Dambala,"Dambala was a fictional skilled reptile handler affiliated with Dr. Kananga's voodoo cult. A minor villain, the character first appeared in the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die, portrayed by the late Bermudian actor Michael Ebbin, and was also seen in the James Bond 007 tabletop role-playing game.
Dambala is the chief of a tribe living on the fictional island of San Monique, which is governed by Kananga, who is secretly behind the appearances of Dambala's god, Baron Samedi, who he needs to use to get Dambala to eliminate his enemies via sacrifices to Baron Samedi. We see one such sacrifice at the end of the pre-titles sequence: MI6 agent Baines is tied to an altar, being menaced with a venomous snake by Dambala as the rest of the tribe dance as part of their strange ritual. Eventually, Dambala throws blood over Baines, and then holds the snake in his face, causing it to bite him to death. Later in the film, Kananga's unfaithful medium Solitaire faces the same fate, as she is tied to the altar facing the insane Dambala and his snake. However, she is temporarily saved when a statue of Baron Samedi appears, and is mistaken for the real Baron Samedi by Dambala, who is distracted. He then turns back to Solitaire to sacrifice her, but James Bond shoots him before he can do it, avenging Baines' death.

1417,/wiki/Black_Box,"The story begins in the French Alps, where James Bond has been dispatched to kill a Corsican assassin. Before he can do so, the man is shot by a masked assailant and 007 gives chase on skis, eventually overwhelming and unmasking... her. Seizing upon his surprise, the girl bludgeons him with her helmet and escapes. He returns to London and is promptly sent to Tokyo to track down and destroy a black box full of compromising British information stolen by hackers. On arriving in Japan he is met by Major Boothroyd in a mobile intelligence station disguised as a coach. He outfits the spy with a hard-drive cloning smartphone, hearing-enhancing earbuds, EMP wristwatch and an Aston Martin DB10. Bond asks him to identify the female assassin from footage he recorded in the Alps and heads to an underground Yakuza casino to investigate his prime suspect in the data breach - technology mogul, Saga Genji. Unbeknownst to 007, he is being followed by the girl.
Bond gambles and attracts Genji's attention. He is taken to a secluded part of the building and beaten. Genji reveals that, thanks to his cybernetic enhancements, he is aware of 007's identity and mission. As he prepares to throw him into a shark tank, they are interrupted by the arrival of the female assassin. She rescues Bond from the tank and, as they flee, Boothroyd contacts him with news of her identity - Selah Sax, a former asset of British government black ops unit, Group 13. And she is supposed to be dead. She takes him to a love hotel and, attempting to prevent him from interfering with her mission, trusses him up. Meanwhile, Genji enlists the assistance of a death-mask wearing assassin (No Name) to kill Bond. After a chat with Boothroyd, Bond attends a sumo tournament to eavesdrop on Genji and acquires a trackable signal emitted from the villain's visor. He also meets a strangely competitive Felix Leiter, fends off No Name, and is subsequently pursued by a motorcycle hit-squad; which he fends off using the DB10's gadgetry. Sax intervenes and 007 is shot by a thug. Driving the wounded spy to safety, she patches him up and, after he regains consciousness in her suite, the pair make love in the shower and form an alliance to pursue Genji.
Several days later, Bond is ordered by M to acquire the black box - which is revealed to actually contain data from all over the world. The UK is now in a race with the other world powers to acquire it for themselves. Bond and Sax follow the signal emanating from Genji's headset to Aokigahara and are ambushed by No Name, who is shot by Sax - seemingly fatally. From there they board a train and Sax opens up to Bond about her past; explaining that she now hunts other assassins to atone for her illicit activity in Group 13. Just then Felix arrives with an offer to work together. Bond neutralizes him using a sedative and, as he attempts to leave with Sax, is caught in a firefight involving Genji's operatives and the CIA. Realizing that Bond doesn't intend to destroy the black box, Sax dissolves their alliance and blows apart the couplings connecting their carriages — inadvertently stranding her with No Name. Bond subsequently locates Genji's HQ beneath the Fukushima nuclear reactor and infiltrates the facility. It is revealed that the villain intends to elevate Japan by giving the data to rival powers and ultimately destabilizing the world. 007 rescues Sax and the pair fight Genji in the dark; during which Bond uses the light from his smartphone to locate the villain and hurls a knife into his forehead. Upon returning to the surface with the box they they are ambushed by Leiter. Moved by Sax's pleas, Bond quietly wipes the box's memory using his wristwatch's EMP feature. The story concludes with Sax and Bond spending intimate time together where it had all started, at a cabin in the French Alps.

1419,/wiki/General_Georgi_Koskov,"Lieutenant-General Georgi Koskov (Russian: Георгий Косков) was a fictional deceitful Soviet General who was in league with arms dealer Brad Whitaker. Portrayed by Dutch actor Jeroen Krabbé, the character was one of the two main antagonists (alongside Whitaker) in the 1987 James Bond film The Living Daylights. He later made an appearance in the 2000 video game 007 Racing, voiced by Alistair Abell.
Georgi Koskov is a deceitful, mastermind and sociopathic Soviet general in business for himself, who carefully plays both sides of the Cold War. Initially, Koskov gives the impression of a somewhat anxious pawn in the battle between the Soviet Union and the West, when he is, in reality, a mastermind using all means to his own advantage. He is prepared to dote on his girlfriend Kara Milovy and give her all manner of expensive gifts (the prize among which is a Stradivarius cello), but when necessary will easily sign her death warrant. He is also secretly working with American arms dealer Brad Whitaker in an illicit arms and drug deal.
Koskov fakes his own defection using Kara Milovy as a sniper to make it look real. James Bond is assigned in aiding him across the border into Austria. At a safe house in England, Koskov falsely and deliberately fingers KGB head General Pushkin as the mastermind of ""Smiert Spionem"" or ""Death to Spies,"" a plot to kill off American and British spies, but Bond suspects the truth. After Koskov is recaptured by the KGB following a raid on an MI6 safehouse after his debriefing, MI6 dispatches Bond to terminate Pushkin despite the 00 Agent's doubts.
Bond eventually discovers through his contact with Kara that defection was not Koskov's true intent, and in an attempt to lure him out, conspires with General Pushkin to fake the latter's death. Bond fakes Pushkin's assassination in Tangier just as Necros was ordered to carry out the attack himself and Koskov moves forward with his plans upon this news. He tricks Kara into incapacitating Bond and flies the two of them to Soviet-occupied Afghanistan where the two of them are to be imprisoned. Despite their eventual escape, Koskov was still left to operate freely.
It is later discovered that Koskov is misusing funds from the Soviet Union to purchase a massive supply of opium with a street value of $500 million from the local Mujaheddin drug lords in Afghanistan; he and Whitaker would then distribute the drugs through the United States and reap huge personal profit in the sales, while still buying up plenty of advanced armaments through Whitaker to bolster the Soviet occupation of the country. Intending to disrupt this exchange, Bond trails Koskov back to the airbase, where he is later rescued by his newfound Mujaheddin allies as they attack the Soviet forces. Amidst the confusion, Bond and Kara hijack the aircraft carrying Koskov's newly purchased opium supply, and make their escape despite Koskov and Necros' attempts to stop them.
Ultimately Koskov is captured by Pushkin just as Bond kills Whitaker in Tangier and is returned to his motherland under armed escort. Koskov is arrested and presumably executed off-screen by the Russian government.

The street scenes were filmed outside the actual club.
At the time of the film, the club was located in Tsim Sha Tsui, on the Kowloon side of Victoria Harbour. This gave rise to a movie blooper when Bond, played by Roger Moore, is picked up outside the club by British agents posing as police, and is told he is being taken to a police station on the Kowloon side (of Hong Kong Harbour), when he is in fact already there.
The Club opened at 14 Hankow Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, in March or May 1971. One of its early managers was Pat Sephton, a former Windmill model. A 1994 court ruling requested it to remove its naked-buttocks neon sign, and to have its naked dancers wear bras or negliges. The Tsim Sha Tsui location closed on April 2004. Rising rents were cited as possible reasons for the closure. The Club re-opened at the first floor of David House, 37-39 Lockhart Road in Wan Chai in 2004, this time mainly as a sports bar, with one of the original bars being recreated in a back room.
In July 2009, the club closed down.

1427,/wiki/007:_Licence_to_Drive,"After testing a new combat simulator (Level 1: Tutorial), James Bond is assigned to investigate a recently formed terrorist group in Beirut City. M instructs him to drive to the terrorists's safe house and make observations (Level 2: Beirut 1). Bond finds that there is no one there and they appear to have left recently. M informs him that MI6 intercepted panicked calls from the group to a handler. The handler was very concerned about an unidentified 'cargo', which the terrorists are moving in three trucks. 007 is subsequently ordered to pursue and destroy them (Level 3: Beirut 2). Due to damage sustained to his car, Bond is provided with a motorcycle for the mission and destroys the vehicles, finishing the last with a rocket-propelled grenade. M then contacts him and sends him to Greece in pursuit of the handler, who is going to transport the cargo on a ship docked in Thessaloniki (Level 4:  Thessaloniki ). 12 hours later, Bond arrives by gadget-equipped speedboat and after fighting off hostile boats reports back to M that the ship is empty. He provides her its registry numbers, which she uses to trace the vessel’s owner –  the arms dealer, Thierry Cogney.
Bond travels to the South of France, where Thierry is attending the Cannes film festival. Knowing Cogney will be returning to his hotel shortly, Bond speeds through the streets in his car, outrunning the local police (Level 5:  Cannes).

It turns out that it is the name of a hotel in Ho Chi Minh City. The Indian Prime Minister is staying at the hotel; leading M to surmise that he is the target. The Manila terrorist organization 007 has been battling has ties with the Pakistani ISI, which Cogney is using to perform the attack. The arms dealer stands to make a lot of money from starting a war between Pakistan and India; the entire region will be destabilized and he can traffic weapons to all sides of the fighting. M orders Bond to leave Manilla and head to Vietnam (Level 12: Manilla 3). Once there, M sends 007 the location of the 'cargo', which they have determined is a powerful explosive device. Bond 'borrows' a helicopter and sets off after the bomb (Level 13:  Ho Chi Min City 1); protecting the truck from enemies until he can board it and drive it to safety (Level 14:  Ho Chi Min City 2). The scheme foiled, M sends 007 to apprehend Cogney. However, 007 is already making for his farm with the bomb; aiming to 'force his retirement'. He detonates it, killing the arms dealer.

1438,/wiki/Devil_May_Care,"Devil May Care was written by author Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) and was set during the 1960s at the height of the Cold War. It was published by Penguin on 28th May 2008 to mark the centenary of Ian Fleming’s birth. It was the first original novel featuring the adult version of James Bond since The Man with the Red Tattoo by Raymond Benson was published in 2002. The novel was promoted as a centenary special, and not a relaunch of the Bond novel series, although additional books have been published sporadically (and by other authors) since then.
The book opens with a drug deal gone sour between an Algerian man living in France, receiving cocaine before being accused of having told the authorities and being tortured by the dealer. Meanwhile René Mathis was on his way to meet his Mistress. After the two had dinner, Mathis was called to investigate the murder of the Algerian man, and in the morgue saw that his tongue had been cut out and had been placed in his hand. Elsewhere, James Bond was on a sabbatical to recover from the events of The Man with the Golden Gun. After a few weeks, he received a call from M, summoning him back to the office. Bond was briefed by M that a Dr. Julius Gorner was been suspected of heroin trafficking, and Bond was assigned to gather information on his trade affairs. Bond was then met with Scarlett Papava, who informed Bond that her sister had been taken captive by Gorner, and was referred to him for help.
She set up a tennis match between Bond and Gorner, who cheated by lifting and lowering the net to his advantage. Papava found out how and was able to shift the match to Bond's favor. She then informed Bond of the circumstances of her sister's ""captivity"", which involved her being a drug addict, and Gorner feeding her habit in exchange for work. Bond then followed Gorner to Iran, where he met with the local MI6 station Chief, who told him that Gorner had eyes all over the city, and that finding Gorner would not be a problem, as they were already being followed. After their dinner, they went to their car to discover that their chauffeur had been murdered and that his tongue was in his hand.
While Station Chief Darius attended the chauffeur's funeral, Bond was left to his own devices in the city and met an American named J.D. Silver, who warned Bond not to get anywhere near Gorner's business, as he was ""part of something huge"". After leaving Silver's company, Bond was quickly approached by Poppy Papava herself, who gave Bond an address that would help Bond in his investigation, and told him that killing him was the only way to stop him. Bond then went to a wharf that Poppy told him to access for information on Gorner, and discovered a winged submarine with the English flag painted on it in an interior dock. After Bond escaped the facility, He met with his driver, Hamid, who took him back to his hotel where Scarlett found him. The three then planned to re-infiltrate the hangar, and when they did they were captured by Gorner's chauffeur, Chagrin, and were flown by helicopter to a fortress in the desert where they were kept prisoner before meeting Gorner himself, who informed took Bond on a tour of his facility where he produced Opioid drugs cheaper than any other company because he enslaved opium addicts and paid them in heroin, which he also produced and shipped to Europe through the Soviet Union and Estonia. With the heroin he produced, Gorner planned to create as many addicts in Britain as Britain made in China.
Elsewhere, the Rene Mathis discovered that Gorner's chauffeur, Chagrin, was a war criminal, and the CIA began to call agents to duty, including the retired Felix Leiter. Bond was then forced to serve as a decoy for Gorner's heroin Convoy, but his car was destroyed and he tried to escape through an underground aqueduct, but was captured again and brought back to Gorner's fortress. Gorner then began to reveal his plan to use his Ekranoplan airship bearing Union Flags to send fake British soldiers in to attack Russia, while Bond was to fly a plane into Stalingrad to create a distraction. The night before the operation, Bond helped Scarlett escape and board the plane he was to pilot in order to help him commandeer it from Gorner's men.
Elsewhere, Felix Leiter contacted Darius Alizadeh, and they began to attempt to set up an ambush for the Ekranoplan, but were tricked by J.D. Silver, who cut their phone line. The two quickly caught up to Silver, who killed Alizadeh after he called in backup to attack the ekranoplan, and Silver was killed by the driver Hamid.
Bond, with Scarlett's help was able to overtake the plane and escape it as it crashed in a mountain range. They then hitchhiked to Moscow where they took a train to Leningrad. on the train they were ambushed by Chagrin, whom Bond was able to kill using a train tunnel to decapitate him. They were ferried from Leningrad to Finland, where they went to Paris on separate planes. While waiting to meet up with Scarlett, Bond received a call from M that told him to go and meet the new 004. while waiting, Bond was attacked by Gorner on an American style riverboat. the two climbed off the boat and onto a bridge. Bond then shot Gorner in the leg, and when he tried to escape he was run over by the boat. Bond then met up with the new 004, who was, just as he suspected, Scarlett. She revealed to him that there was no such person as Poppy Papava, and that she had made up a bit of Gorner's backstory. The two then spent the night in the George V hotel and laughed about their ""office romance"".
Bond is back with a license to thrill. Forty-three years ago, Ian Fleming wrote his last great 007 adventure. Now, in Devil May Care, the world’s most iconic spy returns in a Cold War story spanning the world’s exotic locations. By invitation of the Fleming estate to mark the centenary of his birth, acclaimed novelist Sebastian Faulks picks up where Fleming left off, writing a tour de force that will electrify every James Bond fan. A fitting tribute to the Bond tradition, Devil May Care stands on its own as a triumph of witty prose and plenty of double-0 action.

1439,/wiki/Gabor,"Gabor was the fictional loyal bodyguard to oil heiress Elektra King involved in her and Renard's scheme to destroy Istanbul and monopolize the world's oil market for profit. A secondary antagonist portrayed by Australian actor and former professional wrestler, John Seru, he appeared in the 1999 James Bond film, The World Is Not Enough, along with its accompanying novelisation and video games.
Gabor is the personal bodyguard to oil heiress Elektra King. He is first seen in Azerbaijan, accompanying Elektra to a meeting discussing the controversial planned path of her oil pipeline. Although he doesn't exit the helicopter, he is present when she heads high into the mountains to check the survey lines with British agent James Bond. He also accompanies Elektra when they visit Valentin Zukovsky's casino where she loses a game to the Russian businessman. Gabor is then present when M visits Baku and is informed about Renard's plan to blow-up Elektra's oil refinery. At the command center, after Bond is presumed killed in the attempt to prevent the attack, Elektra reveals she and Renard are conspirators. Gabor assists her in abducting M by shooting her guards with another henchman, Elektra having held a bitter grudge against M for having influenced her father not to pay the ransom to Renard.
Later, Gabor and a group of heavies are waiting outside the Federal Security Bureau's Istanbul safe house, when Mister Bullion attempts to kill Zukovsky, Bond and Christmas Jones using a briefcase bomb. They escort 007 and Jones to their base of operations in the Maiden's Tower at the southern entrance of the Bosphorus strait. However, Zukovsky survived the bombing and leads an assault on the tower. Gabor assists in its defense, but is shot dead by Bond after the spy escapes from an antique torture device. Elektra would later suffer Gabor's fate after being shot by 007 for her refusal to call off her plot.
While the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64 editions of The World Is Not Enough vary in their story and character depictions, Gabor is consistently the 'boss' character the player confronts in the Maiden's Tower. In both versions, Gabor ambushes 007 in a scripted event, following the Istanbul safe house bombing. In the N64 version, while Bond is attempting to rescue M from the prison cells, Elektra enters, tells the spy to drop his weapons, and orders Gabor to kill him. A fist-fight in the narrow hallway ensues. The PS1 variant has Bond battling the bodyguard and his henchmen in a large, circular room. Almost indestructible, the PS1 Gabor can only be killed by utilizing the pipe bombs he hurls. He is absent from the Game Boy variant.
"
1440,/wiki/Ambulanceman,"The Ambulanceman was a fictional unnamed henchman working for Hugo Drax who attempted to kidnap James Bond while disguised as a paramedic in the 1979 film Moonraker. He was portrayed by French actor Guy Di Rigo.
After an encounter with Jaws at the cable car in Rio de Janeiro, Bond and Holly Goodhead land in the grass beneath the cable car, and start to kiss each other.
A group of fake paramedics (dressed in white, carrying two stretchers) appears. Upon seeing them, Bond tells them 'We're in great shape'.
The paramedics knock them out by using batons, and take them to a Chevrolet C-10 Ambulance.
Onboard the ambulance, which speeds through the city (with flashing lights and sirens), this man guards both Bond and Holly. He is a bit distracted by cleaning his finger nails at first, and later gets even more distracted by Holly smiling at him.
Bond secretly frees his hands, and activates an oxygen bottle found in the ambulance.
A fight occures. The ambulanceman loses some hairs when Holly grabs his head, and Bond punches him in the face. Afterwards, both Bond and the henchman roll out of the car on a stretcher. While Bond falls on the street, the ambulanceman lands head-first in a British Airways billboard (reading 'We'll more better care of you'), which most probably kills him.

1441,/wiki/Cyril_Castle_charcoal_Suit,"James Bond wears a charcoal herringbone suit while dining with Mary Goodnight at The Oriental hotel in Bangkok. It is a bespoke suit by English tailor Cyril Castle. Underneath the jacket, Bond wears a white Frank Foster shirt with grey stripes, which is better visible in his hotel room, when he gets out of his jacket, and a black tie.
"
1442,/wiki/A_View_to_a_Kill_(song),"A View to a Kill is the theme song for the Bond film of the same name. The song was written by John Barry and Duran Duran, and was performed by Duran Duran, who were nominated for the best original song at the Golden Globes. The song was also the only James Bond song to ever reach the #1 position on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. 
"
1443,/wiki/British_Secret_Service,"Classic continuityModern continuityThe Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), more commonly known as MI6 (originally Military Intelligence Section 6), or the Secret Service or simply Six, is the United Kingdom's external intelligence agency. SIS is responsible for the United Kingdom's human intelligence (HUMINT) espionage activities overseas, as opposed to the Security Service (MI5) which is charged with internal security within the UK. The Republic of Ireland also falls within MI5's remit. It was founded in October 1909 (along with MI5) as the Foreign Section of the Secret Service Bureau.
From Ian Fleming's 1953 debut novel, Casino Royale, Commander James Bond was employed by the semi-fictional ""Secret Service"". It has appeared in almost every subsequent story in the James Bond franchise. For the most part, the Secret Service has been subsequently identified with the real-life SIS/MI6 in continuation literature and films; one major exception being Jeffery Deaver's literary continuity, which placed Bond in a fictional department named the Overseas Development Group. Fleming's SIS typically operates under the cover-name ""Universal Exports"" and is comprised of subsections such as the 00 section and their research and development division, Q Branch.
From the 1995 film GoldenEye onward, the agency is consistently identified as ""MI6"" and is located for the most-part at the recently constructed real-world headquarters of SIS, the SIS Building at Vauxhall Cross in London. In 1999's The World Is Not Enough, its base of operations would temporarily move to a Scottish castle following a terrorist attack on the SIS Building orchestrated by the anarchist Renard. The Secret Service's designation and headquarters would carry over from the Pierce Brosnan era into the 2006 reboot of the James Bond film franchise (despite a peculiar temporary relocation in Quantum of Solace), until the building's destruction at the hands of Raoul Silva in Skyfall (2012) and its demolition in Spectre (2015). Following the events of Skyfall the bulk of MI6 (including M's office) would relocate to Whitehall, with their quartermaster choosing to operate from an underground workshop, accessible via a river-side tunnel beside the Millbank Millennium Pier.
Q Branch (or later in the franchise Q Division) is the fictional research and development division of the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6). The branch is dedicated to developing tools for agents to use on the field.
I branch is the fictional informatics division of the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6). The branch is dedicated to breaking codes and security protocols. It is a regular practice for I Branch to recreate Russian documents solely from the sounds of keystrokes on manual typewriters deep within the Kremlin.

1444,/wiki/Bob_Simmons,"Bob Simmons was an English actor and stunt man, best known for his work in many British made films, most notably EON Productions' James Bond film series from its inception in 1962 with Dr. No until the 1985 film A View to a Kill.
When Albert R. Broccoli began to produce the James Bond films, Simmons tested as an actor for the Bond role, but until his death in 1987, he became the stunt coordinator for every Bond film except From Russia with Love, (that he joined later in the production) On Her Majesty's Secret Service (where he worked on Sean Connery's Shalako along with cinematographer Ted Moore) and The Man with the Golden Gun. He appeared in the gun barrel sequence for Sean Connery in three James Bond films: Dr. No, From Russia with Love, and Goldfinger. Simmons is the only person to officially perform the scene, while not starring in the main role as James Bond. Simmons also had a role as SPECTRE agent Jacques Bouvar in the pre-title sequence of the fourth film, Thunderball.
Simmons developed a stunt technique involving trampolines, first used in You Only Live Twice, whereby stuntmen would bounce off a trampoline in concert with a triggered explosion so as to simulate being blown into the air. This was used in many other films, including by Simmons again in The Wild Geese, where Simmons also doubled for Richard Burton.
Upon retirement, Simmons wrote an autobiography entitled Nobody Does It Better titled after the theme song for the 1977 Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me.

1445,/wiki/A._C._Andrews,"A. C. Andrews was a fictional crewman serving aboard the British Royal Navy submarine, HMS Ranger. A minor character played by British actor Jeremy Bulloch, he appeared in the 1977 James Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me.
Andrews was crew member aboard the HMS Ranger, one of Britain's four nuclear submarines. He is off-duty, playing a game of chess with Peters in the mess hall when the vessel begins to violently shake; its electromechanical systems jammed by Karl Stromberg's submarine-hunting Liparus supertanker. The Ranger is forced to the surface, where it is swallowed by the tanker. Andrews and his fellow submariners remain prisoner on-board the Liparus until James Bond liberates them. His commanding officer, Talbot, leads a raid on the ship's armory and provides weapons for the newly liberated British, American and Soviet sailors. Andrews participates in the battle for control of the ship and joins the Navigation Officer in an ill-fated assault on the fortified control room, where he is mowed down by machine-gun fire.

1446,/wiki/Dr._Julius_No_(Joseph_Wiseman),"Dr. No learns from his associate, local geologist Professor R.J. Dent, that British Secret Service agent John Strangways has been investigating his activities on Crab Key; obtaining suspiciously radioactive rock samples from the island. This prompts No to deploy his enforcers, the Three Blind Mice, to kill the inquisitive Strangways and his secretary Mary Trueblood. Fellow British spy, James Bond, is subsequently sent to Jamaica by his superior M to investigate their murders. Hoping to keep Bond from intruding on his business, Dr. No gives both the Mice and Dent orders to eliminate him. However, Bond manages to survive and kill his would-be assassins. He then sails with local fisherman Quarrel to investigate Dr. No's radioactive activities on Crab Key. There, they encounter shell diver Honey Ryder, who confides that she believes that Dr. No was been responsible for the death of her father when he went shell diving at Crab Key and didn't return. No zealously protects his privacy on the island using a flame-throwing tank the locals fearfully refer to as a 'dragon'. Quarrel is subsequently incinerated by the vehicle, whose crew take Bond and Honey captive.
Shortly afterwards, No's assassin Xenia Onatopp leads an assault on Goldfinger's Midas casino in Las Vegas; the goal of which is the theft of the OMEN from its underground vault. After the assault falters, Onatopp retreats to Dr. No's military staging area at the Hoover Dam, where she organizes a defence of the structure. No attempts to keep the authorities away from the Dam by threatening to detonate a seismic bomb. However, GoldenEye and Oddjob manage to bypass Xenia's security and prematurely detonate the bomb; causing the dam to disintegrate and annihilate No's men. Searching for the location of Dr. No's island of Crab Key, GoldenEye is dispatched to the organization's underwater auction house, bank and blackmarket, The Octopus in a bid to retrieve the navigation coordinates from the lair's computer system. He is eventually sent to Crab Key, where he confronts Dr. No. During their duel, GoldenEye uses his mechanical eye to sabotage the island's nuclear reactor, causing it to electrocute Dr. No.
"
1447,/wiki/Agent_Under_Fire,"CIA agent Zoe Nightshade, a mole in the Hong Kong based Identicon Corporation, is discovered and captured. Identicon, a botanical research firm, is a possible front for a weapons-smuggling ring. James Bond infiltrates the facility in an attempt to rescue her, as well as retrieve a suspicious courier case in the same building. After freeing Nightshade from a submarine set to launch, the pair flee the facility with the courier case. Nigel Bloch, the head of Identicon, has his forces chase the agents through the streets of Hong Kong. The two steal a second case of vials from a nearby Identicon factory. They then rendezvous with R, who provides Bond with a gadget-laden BMW Z8. A limousine pulls up, as an assassin inside launches a rocket at the agents, killing Zoe, and steals the case. Bond gives chase, stopping an armored van which contained the stolen vials.
The vials contain nine blood samples, eight of which contained blood of world leaders. One contains the blood of British diplomat Reginald Griffin, serving in Romania, who is obsessed with protecting a room, outside of his jurisdiction, in the embassy. Bond investigates the embassy, finding Griffin dead, before a similar-looking man attacks him. After overcoming him, Bond finds a message from Bloch on Griffin's computer that mentions Malprave Industries, based in Switzerland. Bond takes the information from the computer and escapes.
At Malprave Industries, Bond, posing as a journalist, sees that the CEO is a woman he met at the embassy, Adrian Malprave. After collecting evidence, he makes his escape from the facility. Analysis of the computer message from Romania mentions ""Damaged Goods,"" believed to be a codename for Dr. Natalya Damescu, formerly in the employ of Malprave, now under protection at the British embassy in Romania. She also has inside information to offer. Carla the Jackal, an infamous terrorist who also killed Zoe, leads a raid on the embassy. Bond fights the terrorists before running into Damescu. After a confrontation with the Jackal, Bond picks up a data chip on something known as Poseidon, and delivers it to R for analysis.
The chip leads Bond to an oil rig in the South China Sea. After running into Bloch, Bond follows him into Poseidon, an underwater base devoted to clone development. After destroying the lab, he climbs onto a submarine bound for a Royal Navy aircraft carrier. On the submarine, Bond finds Zoe, who reveals that the woman he ""saved"" from the Identicon facility was a clone meant to infiltrate the CIA, and that the Jackal intended to kill Bond.
Depending on whether or not the player picked up the verification code, Bond and Zoe are either captured or are taken to the carrier unharmed. In either case, the pair investigate the ship. It is discovered that 8 world leaders have been cloned, and are to be replaced by the clones. Bond destroys the craft carrying the clones, and the pair make their escape. They arrive at Malprave's base in the Swiss Alps, where Bond saves the eight world leaders. Before he can escape the base, however, he encounters Malprave, who has set the base to self-destruct. She reveals Bloch is still alive, and that Bond had killed his clone. After an encounter with him, Bond follows him into the main office and kills him. He manages to escape the base before it explodes, taking Malprave with it.
Starting with GoldenEye 007 and continuing on with The World Is Not Enough, multiplayer support in a James Bond game has become a staple. The multiplayer mode in Agent Under Fire features up to 4 players, with the option for AI bots in the Xbox and GameCube versions.
Agent Under Fire features over fifteen different types of firearms as well as other weapons. Each firearm is based on a real firearm, but is given a pseudonym, the same manner as the weapons in GoldenEye 64, and The World is Not Enough. Most of the gadgets are concealed in a mobile phone, including a decryptor, grapple, laser, and remote transmitter. Bond is also provided with a card that disrupts electronic signals, as well as a jetpack.
Once all troubles at EA had settled down, a new development team was put together and production of an altogether new game quickly began, creating a new story, new characters, and modifying the unfinished The World Is Not Enough engine for the new title. Though the PC and PlayStation versions of The World Is Not Enough were ultimately cancelled, many assets from these games made their way into the finished version of Agent Under Fire:
In addition to borrowing assets from The World Is Not Enough, the game was heavily influenced by 1997's GoldenEye 007. EA stated in several gaming magazines that Bond would be going ""back to its roots,"" as the game was originally designed to be a true successor to Rare's iconic 1997 video-game. Notably, early promotional screenshots of the game reflected this, featuring the renowned GoldenEye 007 health-bar.

1451,/wiki/Billy_%22The_Grinner%22_Ring,"At some point, Ring joined the Machine, a crime syndicate based out of Chicago, Illinois. The Machine formed an alliance with Unione Siciliana, who served as the gang's financial backers.
At some early stage in his career, somebody cut off Ring's lower lip, giving him a permanent smile.
While involved with the Machine, they got friendly with women, traded hemp, and partook in watching races on the racetrack.
By the 1940s, the gang ravaged Chicago, leaving corpses wherever they went. Between fights, they would frequently hide at the Little Bohemia Lodge near Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
By the 1950s, the gang grew tired of the violence, and when Ring became the leader of the Machine, they unanimously decided to leave the ""fireworks business"".
Ring would later believe that the old days were gone because of the notorious gangsters like Big Jim Colosimo, Johnny Torrio, Dion O'Banion, and Al Capone, and described their fate as ""pushing up the morning glory by the fence"".
In June 1957, Ring travelled to New York City and collaborated with gangsters Helmut M. Springer, Jed Midnight, Jack Strap, Mr. Solo, and Pussy Galore. All of the gangsters had been selected by SMERSH treasurer Auric Goldfinger, codenamed as ""Mr. Gold"", to rob Fort Knox in Kentucky.
During the robbery, where Pussy Galore and her gang impersonated nurses, Jed Midnight's men impersonated Red Cross doctors, while Midnight, Ring, Mr. Solo, and Jack Strap wore robes signifying their status as senior physicians to falsely mirror their leadership status.
After the raid failed due to James Bond's message to Felix Leiter, Goldfinger personally executed Ring by gunshot, along with other mob bosses he hired for the job.
Billy is described as being around 40 years old, and having a pale, pear-shaped baby face described as being ""out of a nightmare"", downy skin, a soft thatch of straw-colored hair, tawny brown eyes (instead of pale blue), and a permanent false smile because his lower lip had been cut off, giving him trouble pronouncing the letters ""b"", ""m"", and ""p"", so he had to bring his lower lip over his teeth to pronounce the letters.

1459,/wiki/Greene%27s_Driver,"The driverUnnamed, the character was a fictional member of the secretive criminal organization, Quantum, who served as Dominic Greene's chauffeur and bodyguard. A minor antagonist portrayed by actor, Carl von Malaisé, he appeared in the 2008 James Bond film, Quantum of Solace.
The silent bodyguard was one of several unidentified Quantum operatives who accompanied Greene to a meeting during a performance of Tosca at an opera house in Bregenz, Austria. Alongside the environmentalist's right-hand man, Elvis, he stands guard over his boss in his personal box. As James Bond compromises the meeting, the driver maintains his stoic appearances, gathering up Greene's cabal of guards and ushering them to his vehicle. As the group prepares to leave, 007 throws Guy Haines' bodyguard on Greene's car. The villain orders the driver to kill the injured man and the driver shot the bodyguard in the chest, killing him and letting Bond be framed for the murder.
Some time later the driver is seen at the Perla de las Dunas in Bolivia's Atacama Desert, where he watches over Greene's meeting with exiled dictator, General Medrano, and the corrupt Bolivian police chief in regards to their payment for Quantum's continued control of Bolivia's water supply. The calm of the meeting is however shattered by the arrival of Bond, who kills the police chief. During the ensuing shooting, Greene and Elvis attempts to evacuate to the hotel's upper floors while the driver stay behind in order to kill Bond but he scarcely proves a deterrent to the determined agent, who shoots the henchman in the stomach repeatedly with a SIG-Sauer P226, killing him. The driver's corpse is later incinerated when the hotel is destroyed.
The driver's calm nature indicated a fierce loyalty to his employer, something further demonstrated by his complete willingness to sacrifice his life to protect Greene. Despite this apparent bond to Greene, he is also shown as a borderline sociopath due to his murder of Guy Haines' bodyguard without flinching or question.

1460,/wiki/Helicopter,"A  helicopter is a type of rotor-craft in which lift and thrust are supplied by rotors. This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover and to fly forward, backward, and laterally. These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed wing aircraft would usually not be able to take off or land. Helicopters can be seen throughout the James Bond film series as well as in games and novels.

After Bond has knocked out Carver Security Guard (Hamburg) 5, he remains on the platform ontop of the moving printing press. Having previously jumped onto the platform, this henchman attacks Bond, but is quickly overpowered: Bond punches his face, breaks his arm and throws him into the printing press, where the long row of freshly printed newspapers suddenly has a trail of blood on them.

Saxby manages Whyte’s end of the casino and first meets James Bond while the latter is posing as Peter Franks. Later Saxby goes up to he office to inform Blofeld that Shady Tree is dead; he then tells his boss to turn on one of the cameras watching 007. Blofeld commands Saxby to “just get me the diamonds.”
He is shot and killed by CIA agents on attempting to assassinate Whyte and Bond while taking cover behind a rock with a sniper rifle as Whyte is being rescued by Bond and the CIA. As the dead Saxby tumbles down a hill, Whyte spouts one of the movie’s best-remembered deadpan-lines: “Tell him he’s fired!”

1463,/wiki/AK-74,"Introduced into the James Bond film series with the 1983 film Octopussy, various Kalashnikov-style rifles have subsequently appeared in The Living Daylights (1987), GoldenEye (1995), and Die Another Day (2002). Often renamed for copyright reasons, the Kalashnikov series of rifles has been represented in the majority of James Bond video games, including GoldenEye 007 (1997), Tomorrow Never Dies (1999), The World Is Not Enough (2000), Everything or Nothing (2004), GoldenEye 007  (2010), and 007 Legends (2012).
In the 1983 film Octopussy, weapons presumably intended to represent generic Soviet Kalashnikov assault rifles of the AK-47 variety are seen in use by rogue General Orlov's Soviet forces and East German border guards. Among the armament depicted as standard Soviet (Warsaw Pact) weaponry in this classic Cold War adventure is the accurately-depicted AKM assault rifle. Hastily seen carried by one soldier just as General Gogol discovers the stolen Soviet treasuries in the salvaged Mercedes-Benz's boot. There's also a scene shown earlier featuring one soldier firing his Kalashnikov modernized assault rifle at 007 in an effort to prevent him from escaping with General Orlov's luxury car (containing the invaluable jewels in the trunk).
Throughout the film, Orlov's men and some border guards use Type 56 rifles, the Chinese-issue AK-47 assault rifle. Besides the obvious ""Russians using Chinese weapons"" issue this is an anachronism since the milled receiver AK-47 was well obsolete by this time for the USSR front-line troops. Orlov's forces are also seen with Adler-Jäger AP-80 carbines, blank firers patterned after the AK-47, while patrolling platforms and railway tunnels near the border. Some border guards also carry these while they're seen investigating the crashed Mercedes' that is being brought up from the river. Czechoslovakian assault rifle designed in the 1950's. Although externally somewha
Many of the Soviet and Czech soldiers, as well as the Mujahideen use milled-receiver AK-47 assault rifles, most likely Chinese Poly Tech Legend copies. Kamran Shah, James Bond and Kara Milovy's Mujahideen ally, wields an AK-47 during the battle with the Soviets. Kara grabs Kamran's AK-47 to go off and help Bond. It is worth noting that the use of AK-derivative by Czechoslovak forces is a mistake as Czechoslovakia was the only Warsaw Pact member that used a standard assault rifle of its own design (Samopal vz. 58). Many of the Bratislava Soviets carry AKMS derivatives. Soviets, Czechs, and Mujahideen also carry AKMS rifles, one of which Bond is able to grab from one of Koskov's Czech soldier on the plane.
The AK-74 and its variants are frequently seen in the Brosnan era of James Bond film franchise (often in the hands of Soviet or North Korean soldiers), most notably in GoldenEye (1995), The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Die Another Day (2002). Bond very frequently uses the AKS-74U, the compact version of the AK-74, by taking them from slain or incapacitated Russian soldiers. He first acquires this weapon during the opening scene at the chemical weapons factory, and then again during the escape from the Soviet archives (he takes this AKS-74U in the T-55 tank with him, and then uses it again when he confronts Trevelyan on his train). Xenia Onatopp also uses an AKS-74U (with two magazines ""jungle-taped"" together). She first uses this weapon to kill all of the technicians at the Severnaya Goldeneye control center, and then is seen carrying it again on Trevelyan's missile train (however, she drops it when the train crashes, and when Trevelyan tries to grab it, he is stopped by Bond, who points his own AKS-74U at him).
Other appearances include The World Is Not Enough, where the Russian military personnel at the Kazakhstan ICBM base are frequently seen using AKS-74Us and in the pre-title sequence of Die Another Day, where the carbine can be seen being carried by Bond and his teammates as they infiltrate North Korea, as well as by some of Col. Moon's men.
The weapons used by the Russian soldiers throughout the movie (and by Bond and Trevelyan during the shootout on the satellite dish) are often referred to as AK-74 or AKS-74 rifles. This is correct in some instances, but wrong in most cases. The vast majority of the so-called ""AK-74s"" used by Russian soldiers in this movie are actually Norinco Type 56 and Type 56-1 rifles, Chinese copies of the AKM and AKMS. The prop weapons used in the movie have been fitted with AK-74-style muzzle brakes and plastic magazines to make them resemble AKS-74s, but the giveaway is the fact that the weapons clearly have under-folding stocks (on the AKS-74, the stock folds to the side), and more curved magazines for 7.62x39mm ammo (the AK-74 magazines are less curved). The weapons are clearly identifiable as Norinco Type 56 and Type 56-1s because they have the distinctive hooded front sights which characterize only Chinese-made Kalashnikov variants.
On a few occasions in the movie, it is possible to spot genuine AK-74 and AKS-74 rifles in the hands of some of the Russian soldiers (see below), usually in non-firing scenes. These are not nearly as common, however, as the mocked-up Chinese Type 56s which are intended to pass for AK-74s.
Likewise, in the opening shootout at the arms bazaar in Tomorrow Never Dies, some of the terrorists are seen shooting at Bond with Norinco Type 56-1 assault rifles with AK-74-style muzzle brakes installed, probably the exact same guns that were used previously in GoldenEye (which had the same armorers as this movie). Several can be seen in Wai Lin's safehouse as well. North Korean soldiers in Die Another Day can be frequently seen using Norinco Type 56-1 rifles at the beginning of the film, likely standing in for AKMS rifles. Some are fitted with AK-74-style muzzle brakes and side-folding stocks, intended to pass for the AKS-74 (similar to GoldenEye).
Appears simply as ""Assault Rifle"" and carries 30 rounds in a magazine. It is sometimes powerful and sometimes weak, differing in every level.
A variant of the AK-47, the AKS-47, appears in the game The World Is Not Enough, with the folding stock removed. Renamed the ""Soviet KA-57"", it shares ammo with all other 7.62mm rifles.
A variant of the AK-47, the AKM (M for ""modernized"" or ""upgraded""; in Russian: Автомат Калашникова Модернизированный), appears in 2004's Everything or Nothing. Called the ""AK-74"", the AKM is (muzzle brake removed) is the second most powerful rifle in the game. It has a faster rate of fire and can bring down enemies with one shot (depending one where you hit), but has a smaller magazine than the SIG SG 552.
An AKS-74U makes an appearance in this game during the Madagascar and Barge stages. Called the FRWL in the game after the film From Russia With Love.
The AKM variant would later reappear in the 2010 video game remake of the original GoldenEye. Russian infantry in many levels carry AKMs, incorrectly labelled as ""AK-47s,"" sometimes with a Trijicon RX01 reflex sight attached. In the Wii version, this scope is incorrectly shown attached directly to the top of the receiver cover instead of mounted via the bracket on the side of the receiver. In Reloaded it is still mounted incorrectly, since it is shown attached with an MP5-style scope mount attached to a random part of the receiver. The AKM is fitted with a smooth AK-47 type handguard rather than the ""palm swell"" AKM handguard.
The ""AK-47"" has a 30-round magazine with a maximum of 240 rounds carriable. In the Wii version it has semi and fully automatic fire modes, while it is auto only in Reloaded. In both games, it is a weak assault rifle with poor range and accuracy. It appears in the single player levels frequently, sometimes bearing a reflex sight or a laser sight. It can be fitted with a reflex sight, a grenadier, a laser sight, or a thermal scope in the online mode. It is unlocked at rank 3 in the Wii version's online mode, while a player starts off with the AK in Reloaded's online play at rank 1. The AK is also seen in the hands of the hero, Ourumov, in the online game mode ""Heroes"". It is much more powerful in the hands of Ourumov, has infinite ammo, and is attached with a grenadier bearing two grenades.
Developed by the same team behind 2010's GoldenEye remake, a revamped version of the AKM model from GoldenEye Reloaded appeared in the 2012 video game 007 Legends during its third level based on Licence to Kill, once again labelled an ""AK-47"". Instead of the incorrect MP5-style scope mount it has an AK-style bracket mounting a rail. As before, the AKM is fitted with a smooth AK-47 type hand-guard rather than the ""palm swell"" AKM hand-guard. As in GoldenEye, the ""AK-47"" has a 30-round magazine with a maximum of 240 rounds carriable.

1464,/wiki/Christopher_Wood_(writer),"Christopher Hovelle Wood (born 5 November 1935 - died 9 May 2015) is an English screenwriter and novelist best known for the Confessions series of novels and films which he wrote as Timothy Lea. Under his own name, he adapted two James Bond novels for the screen: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977 with Richard Maibaum) and Moonraker (1979).
Wood has written many novels. His novels divide into four groups: semi-autobiographical literary fiction, historical fiction, adventure novels, and pseudonymous humorous erotica.
Wood's first brush with Bond was in 1976 when, along with Richard Maibaum, was tasked to write the final draft of The Spy Who Loved Me.
Given that the film was a completely original story, Gildrose comissioned Maibaum a novelization of his scritp which was released as James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me. 
Two years later Wood returned to the world of Bond again crafting the screenplay for the next film Moonraker. Once more he was comssioned by Gildrose to adapt his screenplay into a novelization under the name James Bond and Moonraker.

1467,/wiki/Agia_Triada,"St. Cyril's Monastery was a fictional abandoned Eastern Orthodox monastery in Greece, situated at the top of a rocky precipice over 400 metres high. The location appeared in the 1981 James Bond film, For Your Eyes Only.
St. Cyrils is a monastery in the northern mountains of Greece and sits atop a series of sheer cliffs which was used as a refuge for the Greek resistance during World War II. Both Aris Kristatos and Milos Colombo used it as such when they fought side by side against the Nazis. The monastery is only accessible from the ground by a cabled basket. Decades later, when James Bond is in search of the ATAC system he is taken there by Columbo after deducing that Kristatos is there with the ATAC awaiting General Gogol's arrival to sell it to him.
St. Cyril's was filmed on location at the Holy Trinity Monastery (Greek: Μονή Αγίας Τριάδος) in central Greece, situated in the Peneas Valley northeast of the town of Kalambaka. It forms part of 24 monasteries which were originally built at Meteora, one of the oldest still existing of the Meteora monasteries (Meteora means ""suspended in the air"" in Greek). Six of the 24 monasteries are still active and open to visitors. The church was constructed between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and is included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites titled Meteora.

1472,/wiki/Heller_(Don_Stroud),"Colonel Heller was a fictional Isthmian Military colonel and head of security for Franz Sanchez’s drug cartel. A major antagonist portrayed by American actor Don Stroud, he first appeared in the 1989 James Bond film, Licence to Kill, and was also featured in John Gardner's accompanying novelization.
Around the time of his brief incarceration by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Sanchez had arranged to buy four Stinger missiles (unidentified prototype missiles in the novelization) from the Contras; threatening to shoot down an American airliner if the DEA didn't back off. Felix Leiter gave Bouvier a letter at his wedding, granting Heller immunity if he got the Stingers back. He initially went for the deal, but panicked and reneged on the deal after Bond's failed assassination attempt on Sanchez's life. Preventing his inadvertent meddling in a narcotics investigation into Sanchez's activities, 007 is kidnapped by members of the Hong Kong Narcotics Agency and is taken to a secluded safe house. Their MI6 contact tries to sedate Bond for transport back to London, but the Isthmus military, under the command of Heller, attacks the house with a tank; killing the occupants and liberating a bound and unconscious 007 - assuming him to be an ally.
They bring him back to Sanchez's palatial residence, where the spy tricks Sanchez into believing the narcotics agents to be the assassins. Divulging his identity as a former British agent, he sets in motion a plan to frame one of the drug lord's associates, Milton Krest by planting $5 million of Sanchez's drug money in his ship, the Wavekrest. Having checked Bond's background, Heller confirms his identity and arranges Sanchez's meeting with Krest that evening. His men discover the incriminating money on-board the ship and he assists Sanchez in his murder of Krest via a decompression chamber. The following day Heller accompanies Sanchez, Bond and a group of Oriental business associates to the Cartel's main distribution center. There, 007's cover is blown and he sets fire to the narcotics laboratory. While being fed along a conveyor belt towards an industrial grinder, Bond directs Sanchez's paranoid attention to Heller's absence during the fire, stating ""That's the last you'll see of Heller and your Stingers"". The drug lord finds Heller in the middle of moving the Stingers from his helicopter, who claims that he was ""making sure they were secure"". Sanchez tells him to move the Stingers to his car, whilst looking knowingly at his enforcer Braun. Shortly thereafter, Heller is impaled on the forks of a forklift and rammed through a wall.

After some persuasion, Bond visits Vesper Lynd's tomb to seek forgiveness and finally bring closure to her death. The tomb is blown up and Bond is ambushed by SPECTRE assassins. Bond accuses Swann of betraying him to the organisation and leaves her on a train telling her they will never see each other again.
Five years later, MI6 scientist Valdo Obruchev is kidnapped from an MI6 laboratory. Obruchev has developed Project Heracles, a bioweapon containing nanobots that spread like a virus upon touch. Coded to specific DNA strands, they are only dangerous if programmed to an individual's genetic code. Bond has retired to Port Antonio, Jamaica where, after years of being out of service, he is contacted by the CIA agent Felix Leiter, who is accompanied by Logan Ash, a fellow American agent. They ask for help in tracking down Obruchev, but Bond refuses. That night Bond is tracked down by a woman named Nomi, who has succeeded him as the new 007; she tells him about Project Heracles. Bond contacts M and reproaches him; the nanobot project had been commissioned by M. Bond subsequently accepts Leiter's request for help.
Bond, Leiter, and Ash fly to Cuba and meet Paloma, another CIA agent allied with Leiter. Bond and Paloma infiltrate a SPECTRE meeting with the aim of retrieving Obruchev, but instead, they walk into a trap. Using a bionic eye to see and communicate while still in custody, Blofeld orders Bond to be killed by the nanobots. Instead, all of the SPECTRE members are killed as Obruchev had reprogrammed the nanobots to destroy the organization per Safin's orders, something which both Bond and Blofeld didn't expect. Bond extracts Obruchev to a boat to meet with Felix and Ash, who turns against them as he is in league with Safin. Ash shoots Leiter and escapes with Obruchev while destroying the boat. Bond gets away but Leiter dies from his injuries.
Moneypenny takes Bond to see Q and gain him the opportunity to meet and speak with Blofeld to find out where Obruchev has been taken with the nanobots. However, Safin visits Madeleine and blackmails her into infecting herself with the nanobots. As Madeleine has been the only person in contact with Blofeld since his imprisonment, he instructs her to infect Blofeld. Bond encounters Madeline in the cell, where he touches her on the hand and unknowingly infects himself. A horrified Madeleine leaves the cell. When Bond meets Blofeld, the latter reveals that he deliberately staged the ambush in Matera five years earlier to make it look as if Madeline had betrayed him. Angered by this revelation, Bond attacks Blofeld and unknowingly infects him with the nanobots, killing Blofeld just as Safin planned.
Upon realizing what happened, Bond tracks Madeleine down to her childhood home in Norway. There, he learns that Madeleine has a five-year-old daughter, Mathilde Swann, whom she claims is not his. Madeleine then confesses that, as a boy, Safin's parents were murdered by Madeleine's father on Blofeld's orders, which prompted him to seek revenge on Blofeld and SPECTRE. Despite having succeeded in eliminating Blofeld and SPECTRE, Safin continues his plan for revenge as he, Ash, and their men are on their way to capture Bond, Madeleine, and Mathilde. Though Bond manages to kill Ash and Safin's men, Safin successfully captures Madeleine and Mathilde.
Q, Bond, and Nomi locate Safin on a World War II base on an island between Japan and Russia. They use a plane to infiltrate Safin's headquarters and learn that he plans to use the nanobots as a biological weapon against millions of people on the planet so that Safin can take over the world. Nomi takes Obruchev hostage while Bond searches for Safin, who has Mathilde with him. Bond shoots Safin's guards, but Safin escapes. Mathilde escapes from Safin and reunites with her mother, Bond, and Nomi.
Nomi, Madeleine, and Mathilde escape by boat, while Bond stays behind to open the island's missile silos, which would aid a missile strike from a British warship to destroy the nanobots. Bond and Safin fight, during which Safin shoots Bond several times and infects him with nanobots programmed with the genetic code of Madeleine and Mathilde. Bond kills Safin and opens the silos. Speaking by radio with Madeleine, Bond tells her he loves her and encourages her to move on without him, and she confirms that Mathilde is his daughter. Bond smiles in the realisation Mathilde is his daughter. He dies as the missiles hit the island, destroying the nanobot factory and the virus.
At MI6, M, Moneypenny, Q, Tanner, and Nomi drink in Bond's honour. Elsewhere, Madeleine takes Mathilde to Matera and tells her the truth about her father.

1477,/wiki/From_Russia_with_Love_(soundtrack),"From Russia with Love is the soundtrack for the second James Bond film of the same name. This is the first series film with John Barry as the primary soundtrack composer.
John Barry, arranger of Monty Norman's ""James Bond Theme"" for Dr. No, would be the dominant Bond series composer for most of its history and the inspiration for fellow series composer, David Arnold (who uses cues from this soundtrack in his own for Tomorrow Never Dies).
The title song was sung by Matt Monro. Monro's vocal version is played during the film (as source music on a radio) and properly over the film's end titles. The title credit music is a lively instrumental version of the tune preceded by a brief Barry-composed ""James Bond is Back"" then segueing into the ""James Bond Theme"". On the original film soundtrack, Alan Haven played a jazzy organ over the theme but this version was not released on the soundtrack album. The tune also appears in a soft string arrangement as a theme for Tania. Barry noted that Bart's lyrics used the film's title, but had nothing to do with the film's story, a matter he would rectify when he was assigned the next Bond film, 1964's Goldfinger, which was the first Bond film for which he had total creative control over the soundtrack, including the theme song's music (Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley would contribute the theme's lyrics).
In this film, Barry introduced the percussive ""007"" that came to be considered the 'secondary James Bond Theme'.Template:Citation needed It is used in various Bond films starring Sean Connery and also in Moonraker, starring Roger Moore. The arrangement appears twice on this soundtrack album; the second version, titled ""007 Takes the Lektor"", is the one used during the gunfight at the gypsy camp and also during Bond's theft of the Lektor decoding machine (the soundtrack album version is not heard in the film).
The soundtrack's original recordings are thought to be lost and did not appear when the Bond soundtrack albums were issued in remastered form on CD. The album is different from the film with the album's recording of the main titles sounding slower and not featuring the organ played by Alan Haven. Several tracks on the album do not appear in the completed film. The album was the last of the Bond soundtrack albums to feature more than the usual six tracks per record side.

1478,/wiki/Dolly,"Dolly is the fictional love interest of steel-toothed assassin Jaws. The character appeared in EON Productions' 1979 film Moonraker and was portrayed by French actress Blanche Ravalec.
In Rio de Janeiro, during an attempt to assassinate James Bond by running a cable car into him, Jaws and his associate accidentally crash the car into the terminal building. He is rescued from the rubble by a short, blonde girl and the pair instantly fall in love. The couple later accompany wealthy megalomaniac Hugo Drax and his ""master race"" astronauts, to an orbiting space station. After 007 is taken prisoner, he is lectured (in Dolly and Jaws' presence) on Drax's plan to annihilate and replace the human race with a new master race sired by his handpicked ubermenschen. Bond tricks Drax into revealing his intent to kill anyone who fails to meet his standards of physical perfection – causing the hulking, dentally-disfigured Jaws and his petite, nearsighted girlfriend concern. She provides Jaws with quiet encouragement to switch his allegiance and help 007.
Aided by Bond's sabotage, U.S. space marine astronauts board the station to stop Drax's scheme and destabilize its structural-integrity during the resulting laser rifle firefight. As Bond and his allies flee the disintegrating station, Dolly and Jaws reunite in the control room and share a final bottle of Bollinger Champagne together. Shortly afterward, Dolly and Jaws help Bond and Holly Goodhead escape in Moonraker 5 by releasing a jammed docking mechanism. The section which they were on subsequently broke away from the exploding station and drifted. The space marines' commanding officer, Colonel Scott, later reported to mission control that he had picked up two survivors from the doomed station - ""a tall man and a short blonde woman"".

1479,/wiki/Dr._Kananga,"PoliticianDr. Kananga, also known as Mr. Big, was the main antagonist in the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die and was portrayed by American actor Yaphet Kotto.
Drug baron and dictator of a fictitious Caribbean island named San Monique, Kananga is loosely based on the main villain of Ian Fleming's second James Bond novel, Live and Let Die. Like his novel counterpart, Kananga adopts the alias ""Mr. Big"" to conduct his illicit activities, however the difference of novel and film versions of the character are radically different to the point of being completely different people.
Dr. Kananga, operating under the alias ""Mr. Big"", is a businessman and owner of a chain of restaurants in New York City and New Orleans called ""Fillet of Soul"". As Big, he is also the head of one of the most vicious street gangs in Harlem. Kananga is the de facto dictator of the fictional Caribbean island of San Monique and thus has certain diplomatic immunities in the United States easily allowing him to smuggle drugs into the country.
Kananga grows vast quantities of opium in San Monique's poppy fields under the protection of large camouflage nets and guarded by the mystical Baron Samedi. Using the poppies, Kananga hopes to flood the U.S. market with two tonnes of heroin distributed through his legitimate restaurants free of charge, thus forcing other drug dealers out of business. In doing so, he believes that he would double the amount of addicts, which he would be able to exploit with his newfound monopoly.
Kananga attracts the attention of the Secret Intelligence Service when three British agents are killed in the space of twenty-four hours while investigating his business. One agent (Dawes) is killed during a UN meeting at which Kananga and Solitaire are present, another (Hamilton) in New Orleans by the brass band and the last (Baines) is murdered by Dambala, a member of Kananga's voodoo cult on San Monique.
MI6 assigns one of its best agents, James Bond, to investigate the tyrant and his connection with the murders. The agent 007 travels to New York, where Kananga is supposed to arrive later, at the San Monique embassy. However, the villain is warned about Bond's arrival and intentions by the medium Solitaire. To get rid of Bond, he sends his minion Whisper, who shoots Charlie, the driver of Bond's car while on the Rockfeller Expressway. Charlie, now dead from a poison dart, slumps over in his seat and his foot puts its full weight on the gas, causing the car to accelerate rapidly and possibly careen off the expressway. However, Bond grabs the wheel and pulls the emergency brake.
Kananga, who has left the UN and returned to the embassy, knows that he is being watched and that his office is most likely bugged. To deceive the CIA, he starts playing a pre-recorded tape in which he dictates a long, nationalistic letter. He and his associates (Solitaire, Tee Hee and Whisper) then change clothes and leave the embassy through a hidden exit in his office. Thinking that Kananga is still in his office, Felix Leiter calls his friend Bond and tells him to go after Whisper instead. Local police found that the car Whisper was driving when murdering Charlie was registered to the O. Cult Voodoo Shop. Following Whisper in a parking garage, Bond is disturbed by the arrival of Kananga and his henchmen, who enter a car and leave, pursued by Bond.
Bond follows the car in a cab, unaware that Kananga's spies inform their boss about Bond's every move. Arriving at Harlem, Bond sees Kananga's car before the Fillet of Soul restaurant and enters. The taxi driver, also a spy of Kananga, informs his boss that Bond is coming.
In the restaurant, Bond is seated at a table at the wall. While waiting for his drink, Bond tries to bribe the waiter for information but the wall and the table spin, bringing Bond into a secret room. There, three armed henchmen await him, telling him that Mr. Big will ""take care"" of him soon. Bond briefly talks to Solitaire, before Tee Hee arrives and asks the medium whether Bond is armed. Solitaire looks into the cards and confirms this, and Tee Hee disarms Bond with the metal claw he has as his right hand; he uses his artificial appendage to flatten the barrel of Bond's gun.
007 is then brought before their leader. Mr. Big asks Solitaire whether Bond is the one who tailed them from uptown. Bond tries to introduce himself but Big only looks at him briefly and then tells his men to bring Bond outside and kill him. He then leaves the room.
Two of Kananga's henchmen then bring Bond in an abandoned sidealley, where the British agent quickly takes them out. Another black man then arrives, holding his gun at Bond, but the man turns out to be a CIA agent named Harold Strutter. Both men, together with Felix Leiter (who is communicating via a radio in Strutter's car), then wonder how Kananga and Mr. Big fit together. Telling the agents that Kananga is about to leave the USA and return to San Monique, Leiter sends Bond after him.
Knowing that Bond has arrived at San Monique, Kananga sends Whisper, a poisoned snake, and CIA double agent Rosie Carver after Bond, who kills the snake by igniting his deoderant with his cigar and burning it. Due to a warning sent by Solitaire, Bond realises that Rosie is false and he is also able to kill the snake. The next day, Bond and Rosie set out to travel to the point where Baines was killed. Again, Kananga is warned by Solitaire, who he has confined to a isolated palace, about Bond's arrival on the island. He then asks Solitaire about the future. When she draws the card ""The Lovers"", a card Bond drew on their earlier meeting, Solitaire pauses for a moment. Kananga realises this and asks her whether the card meant death. Solitaire goes with the lie and confirms this. Kananga then calls his henchmen, telling them to prepare and that Rosie knows what to do.
Eventually confronting Rosie, Bond reveals that he knows she works for Kananga. Holding her at gunpoint, he tries to force her to give up information. However, when Rosie sees a voodoo totem, she is deeply afraid although Bond believes it to be an act. Rather risking Bond than Kananga, Rosie tries to run off. However, she is shot by a gun hidden inside the mouth of one of the totems on Kananga's orders. After Rosie's death, Kananga travels to Solitaire's palace to find out what went wrong. Telling her that the trap was set and that she saw death, he asks her how Bond could survive. Solitaire tells him that the death she saw must have been Rosie's and that she cannot be held responsible for Kananga's misinterpretations if he fails to ask specific questions. Kananga tells her that her growing impertinence disturbs him. He reminds her what happened to her mother when she lost her power and became useless. He then asks where Bond is now, but Solitaire can't answer him. She tells him that she cannot see when he treats her like that, as thing become unclear. He confines her to her chambers, telling her that she made him angry and he does not want to be. After Solitaire is gone, he talks to Tee Hee.
At the night, Bond infiltrates Solitaire's palace and seduces her. By sleeping with her, she loses her power and becomes useless for Kananga.
When Solitaire is about to bring Bond to Kananga's heroin field, which is protected by large camouflage nets, Kananga is warned. He tells his men to kill Bond if he finds the field, but Bond is able to escape all pursuers. Now aware that Kananga is smuggling heroin, Bond travells to New Orleans because Hamilton was killed there. However, while in a taxi, they are kidnapped by the driver, who is the same one as in New York. He brings them to an airfield, telling them that Mr. Big wants to see him because he stole something from a friend of Big. However, Bond is able to defeat Kananga's men and returns to Felix Leiter. Solitaire, however, is left behind, and returns to possession of Kananga.
In New Orleans, Leiter and Bond enter the Fillet of Souls, unaware that Strutter (they were supposed to meet there) had been killed by the same assassin that killed Hamilton. Remembering his last adventure in the Harlem restaurant of the Fillet of Soul chain, Bond decides against a table at the wall, instead choosing one in the middle of the room, right up at the front of the stage. Felix is then called away by the restaurant's maître d′, under the pretext of a phone call from Strutter, and Bond, along with the table and chairs, is lowered into the ground, having once again become a victim of Kananga's trap doors.
Bond lands in a room in which he is greeted by Tee Hee, Mr. Big and Solitaire, and finds himself secured to a chair by Tee Hee. Big tells him that by taking Solitaire with him, Bond stole something extremely valuable from his ""good friend"" Kananga. Big then tells Bond that while he has plans with Bond, there is, firstly, a question he needs to answer for Kananga. Bond replies that, for the question to be answered, Big had to ship him back to San Monique, as Bond wouldn't answer to lackeys. Though Big angrily asks Bond whether he touched Solitaire, Bond states that he will answer this question only to Kananga, intending to buy time.
However, Big rips his own face off, revealing that it was only a latex mask, and that he himself is Kananga. This causes Bond to seemingly finally realise Kananga's plan: Kananga grows heroin on San Monique and sells it as Mr. Big, thereby making the full profit. However, Kananga laughs, telling him that he wouldn't sell heroin for money. Bond remarks sarcastically that Kananga surely would just give it away, but Kananga confirms that this is exactly what he is intending: a underworld version of ""dumping"" (undercutting prices). He agrees that Bond was correct about Fillet of Soul being a front business and the distribution points for his heroin racket; ""anyone is welcome, black or white, male or female"". By distributing two tons of free heroin, he plans to drive every major drug dealer in the United States (particularly the crime families) out of business, and likely doubling, if not trebling or more, the amount of addicts. By driving up the price of the heroin after securing this monopoly, he intends to make a fortune. Kananga snidely adds that after the plan is done to fruition: ""the only monopolies in America will be me and the post office!""
After having revealed his plan, he comes back to his initial question, whether Bond slept with Solitaire. When Bond refuses to answer out of gentlemanliness, Kananga intends to find out another way. He has Tee Hee take off Bond's watch, which Tee Hee then brings to Kananga. Bond thinks to himself how Kananga could have found out about the watch's abilities from Q Branch. Kananga then tells Tee Hee to snip off the little finger on Bond's right hand on Solitaire's first wrong answer, proceeding to ""more vital organs"" with every subsequent wrong answer. However, Kananga has no knowledge that this watch was invented by Q, simply seeing it as an ordinary man's wristwatch. He then reads a registration number off the back of Bond's watch and asks Solitaire whether he spoke the truth. Solitaire, only able to guess, tells Kananga that he spoke the truth, and Kananga tells Tee Hee to let Bond go, letting him out of the restraint chair, even giving him back his watch. However, as soon as Bond puts his watch back on, Tee Hee knocks him out with his metal arm. Whisper, on cue, arrives in the room and is told by Kananga to take Bond to ""the farm"".
After Whisper and Bond are gone, Samedi, wearing more modern-styled clothes, enters the room. Solitaire then asks Kananga when they will go back to San Monique. Kananga tells her that they will go back soon, but then asks Solitaire why she betrayed him, revealing that the number he read was wrong, and he even gave her a fifty-fifty chance. He wants to know why she betrayed him although he gave her everything and she lacked for nothing. She tells him that the cards foresaw it. He angrily smacks her to the ground, telling her that in proper time he would have given her love and that she knew that. He says that there is only one appropriate way to deal with this betrayal, to which Samedi draws the tarot card 'Death'. Building on this, he says there is one proper time for administering this; on cue, Samedi draws the card marked 'Midnight'
He later intends for Solitaire to be executed by Baron Samedi in voodoo fashion on San Monique, mirroring the fate that befell Baines. Solitaire is tied to two posts by her wrists, and Dambala picks a snake from a coffin filled with snakes with which to kill her. The ceremony atendees summon Baron Samedi from one of the graves in the cemetery, and he gives the order for Dambala to move in for the kill. However, Bond, who has infiltrated the island with the aid of Quarrel Jr. after seeing the half-burnt tarot cards spelling Solitaire's fate, kills Dambala and another man who tries to attack him, seemingly kills Samedi and saves Solitaire, after blowing up the heroin fields.
By a hidden elevator used by Samedi built into one of the graves in the church cemetery, Bond and Solitaire enter Kananga's underground base, where the two are quickly captured and brought before Kananga, who, despite Bond's intervention, is celebrating his success. Kananga reveals to Bond that they found his wetsuit on the beach, before the destruction of the fields, and were thereby expecting him. He acknowledges that Bond blew up some of his heroin but reveals that there is more then enough left, as Bond has done only minor harm. He then takes Bond's gun, admitting that he is very intrigued by it. He asks Bond what it does and Bond tells him that it is a shark gun that shoots compressed gas pallets.
Kananga laughs and aims the gun at the sofa Whisper is sitting on, causing the covering on the main body to inflate and eventually explode. Kananga is highly amused, calling the weapon ingenious. He then takes one of the gas pallets, but Bond warns him to not meddle with it, as the air inside is already ""foul enough"". Kananga replies that he never thought Bond would be a a bad loser, stating that he expected that Bond would drink with him on the success on his operation. The agent and the traitor are then tied up and attached to a winch normally used to carry the heroin onto a monorail that takes it to the coast for shipment. Bond, expecting that the winch will be lowered into the water beneath, states that surely there must be a more efficient way of drowning someone. Kananga says that they will hardly have the chance to drown. He then cuts Bond on the arm three times, just enough to draw blood. Whisper then starts lowering the winch into the water and opens a underwater gate, through which sharks enter. With the electromagnetic field in his watch, Bond obtains the gas pellet Kananga played with before. Bond also uses his watch to free himself from the ropes. Jumping down onto the ground, he runs towards Kananga. Whisper tries to warn his master, but due to his whispering voice, Kananga cannot hear him. Bond drops Whisper into one of the air tight metal capsules used to keep the heroin dry, locks him inside, and engages Kananga. During their fight, both men fall into the water. Underwater, Bond forces Kananga to swallow the gas pallet after pulling the pin out, causing Kananga to inflate enormously like a giant balloon and rapidly rise to the cave's ceiling before exploding into pieces, in which Bond would quip that Kananga ""always did have an inflated opinion of himself"".
Dr. Kananga and Baron Samedi appear in 2012 in the video game 007 Legends as two of the multiplayer characters.
As a well-known and respected UN politician, Kananga is a charismatic and authoritarian man. He can know the doings of his antagonists thanks to Solitaire, who is never far from him, but his tyrannical authority and considerable influence make her fear him because he treats her almost like a slave, while considering that her psychic power is only there to serve him, and is even ready to withdraw it if the urge takes him. As such, he was horribly jealous when his valued ally had a relationship with Bond and so tried to eliminate them both in a convoluted manner, demonstrating the high value he places on loyalty and his intolerance of betrayal. Kananga is also willing to use any means imaginable to find out what his enemies are hiding from him and does not hesitate to use torture and intimidation to get what he wants, as was the case during his interrogations with Bond. Furthermore, because of his power, the dictator has an implicit tendency to be convinced of his own superiority, to the point of being arrogant and conceited. He is also determined to seize every opportunity that can further his plans and is alert to loopholes in the system which he tends to use to his advantage.
Kananga's status as an ambassador makes him distinguished and careful in his appearance, usually wearing dark, high-collared suits that fit perfectly with a tie and briefcase in the top pocket of his jacket. He always expresses himself in a polite and formal manner even when he is angry, and may display a jovial, childish and somewhat extravagant mood in certain situations.
As a Grosbonnet, the gangster adopts an entirely different appearance, opting for contrasting but still expensive costumes including leather jackets and bandanas around his neck. His language is also radically more casual and he insults his enemies much more easily while unleashing his anger and aggression more often. These two contrasts in the character's personality make it even harder to believe that he is leading a double life and therefore give him a definite advantage over his enemies.
At thirty-three, the actor Yaphet Kotto, who portrayed Kananga, is the youngest actor to play a main antagonist in a Bond film.

1480,/wiki/From_Russia_With_Love_(book),"From Russia, with Love, published in 1957, is the fifth James Bond novel written by Ian Fleming. From Russia, with Love is frequently considered the best James Bond novel by many fans and critics (although even critical opinion varies greatly). The novel is credited with launching the James Bond craze, and leading to the official EON Productions film series. Its biggest boost came four years after From Russia, with Love was published from an article in Life magazine on 17 March 1961 in which U.S. President John F. Kennedy included it in a list of his favorite books; the James Bond novel was the only work of fiction in the list of ten.
The title of the book is occasionally printed with a comma, as From Russia, with Love, depending upon the publisher. It is more commonly printed without the punctuation. In 1979, Oxford University Press published a simplified adaptation of the novel, written by Rosemary Border, under its Alpha Thrillers imprint; this version was intended for people learning to read.
In Istanbul, Bond meets Darko Kerim, the leader of the British substation in Istanbul. Bond likes this man on sight. The two men spend a great deal of time together over the next few days because Kerim believes Bond should not sit in one place and wait for Tatiana to approach him. During this time, Bond not only sees more of Istanbul than he ever wanted, but he becomes involved in a plot against Kerim by a local gang who work for the Russians. This plot has nearly killed Kerim once with a bomb and they attack Bond and Kerim a second time while they are visiting a gypsy friend of Kerim's. Kerim decides he must take out their leader in order to stop these attacks. Bond goes with Kerim and watches as he executes this man in cold blood.
The next morning, Kerim is found murdered. Bond decides to stay on the train, however. A man boards the train and Bond thinks he is another MI6 agent. The man agrees to share the guard duties and stays with Bond and Tatiana in their stateroom. However, the man is Grant, the assassin, and the next morning he allows his identity to be known.A confrontation between Bond and Grant takes place on board, when Grant is shot by Bond.
Later, after successfully delivering Tatiana to the West, Bond has a final encounter with Rosa Klebb in Paris which leaves her dead and Bond poisoned.

1481,/wiki/Count_Lippe_(Guy_Doleman),"On his first meeting with Lippe, Bond notices a criminal tattoo (a red square with a spike through it shaped like a Chinese Character ""中""- a Tong symbol) on the man's wrist. Suspicious, he searches Lippe's room, but is seen leaving by Palazzi who is bandaged after plastic surgery. Lippe tries to murder Bond with a spinal traction machine, but is foiled by Patricia Fearing. As in the novel, Bond retaliates against Lippe by trapping him in a steam bath and turning up the heat.
Using a fake ambulance, which Lippe had arranged, they transport the dead and bandaged Derval back to Shrublands to make it appear that he is Palazzi. As they dispose of the body, they are suddenly interrupted by Bond and are forced to abandon the corpse in the traction room. As he makes a phone call, one of Lippe's assistants makes an attempt on Bond's life, but is ultimately killed. On his way out of the traction room, Bond trips the fire alarm, forcing the Count to flee the scene.
The following morning, Bond leaves due to an urgent call from the office. Lippe notices him leaving and sets off in pursuit of Bond's DB5. Approaching from behind, the Count attempts to shoot 007 with a revolver. As Bond prepares the car's defenses, Lippe's vehicle suddenly bursts into flames - shot from behind by the rockets of a masked assassin's motorcycle. As the assassin streaks past, Lippe's vehicle careers out of control and topples into a ditch where it explodes violently. It is revealed that Lippe was killed by Volpe on Blofeld's orders, as punishment for his poor judgement in hiring the greedy Palazzi.
During his death's scene, Lippe was played by the stuntman Bob Simmons, who also played Jacques Bouvar in the same film and Ivan in The Spy Who Loved Me.

During Bond and Wai Lin's escape by motorcycle, they are chased not only by Range Rovers, but also by Carver's helicopter, an Eurocopter AS355 Ecureuil 2 manned by four henchmen (two pilots and two shooters).
This man, sitting on the right back seat of the helicopter, is seen firing his MP5K at Bond and Wai Lin. He wears aviator sunglasses and aviation headphones by American company David Clark.
When Bond forces the helicopter to crash and explode, he is killed together with all other occupants of the aircraft.

1483,"/wiki/Data-X,_Inc.","Data-X, Inc. was a fictional technology company specializing in computer hardware; owned by wealthy industrialist, Xerxes Xerophanos. It appeared in the James Bond comic strip, The League of Vampires, which ran in The Daily Express newspapers between October 25, 1972 and February 28, 1973.
A computer firm owned by industrialist Xerxes Xerophanos, Data-X, Inc. was a keystone of his industrial power base. During the 1970s the company came under threat from an Anglo-American venture between Clayton Computers and Computrex; who had developed revolutionary new computer technology with implications to the military and space fields. In order to protect his business empire and maintain the global balance of power (beneficial for his munitions firms), Xerophanos plotted to destroy his rivals' new British computer plant with a stolen nuclear bomb. His scheme was ultimately foiled by MI6 operative, James Bond. Following its owner's demise, Data-X's fate is unknown. If it survived it was likely ruined in the long-run by Clayton Computrex, Ltd..

1485,/wiki/Blofeld%27s_Piranhas,"The piranha tank is an apparatus designed for carrying out executions. The device consists of a foot pedal trigger and a collapsible bridge suspended over a tank containing predatory fish. The equipment was featured in EON Productions' 1967 James Bond film You Only Live Twice.
Blofeld's Piranhas are predatory fish that Blofeld keeps in a pool in his Volcano Lair. He uses them as a method of execution for those who displease him.
The fishes can shred a human to the bones in less than 30 seconds.
The only person alongside Hans in the Bond franchise, who is thrown on-screen inside this tank by Blofeld is Helga Brandt. She was once working as a low-rank assistant and secretary who was ordered by her superior Osato to kill Bond, but she had sex with him first and finally failed to kill him. She was then called by Blofeld but was unable to justify herself when Osato put the whole blame on her. Blofeld, who doesn't tolerate any failure, decides to kill her by dropping her into the tank. Helga is shown thrashing in the waters, screaming out in pain, with everyone watching including Osato who seemed actually shocked about the immediate situation. This lasts very shorty until she is completely dragged underwater, though despite the piranhas being known to reduce a person to bones, her ""body"" never actually resurfaces to show the aftermath. This version of eliminating incompetent henchmen is considered to be the worse and only serves as an example for the other SPECTRE employees and shows that Blofeld doesn't have an ounce of leniency for them and doesn't care to kill women and young employees. Brandt was once loyal to Blofeld who assumed all the dirty work to satisfy her superiors, but unfortunately, just failing one task was enough to be killed for it, showing the employees what can happen to them if they fail in their job even once, also making Blofeld to be considered one of the worse and blood-lusted villains Bond had ever encountered. 
In a brief scene, Bond later knocks Blofeld's bodyguard Hans into the pool and jokes ""Bon Appetit"" to the Piranhas.

A minor character, he appeared in the 1997 James Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies, portrayed by British actor Michael Byrne. He also was adapted for the film's accompanying novelisation, penned by Raymond Benson.
During a standoff with the Chinese Navy in the South China Sea, prompted by the sinking of a British ship, Admiral Kelly commands the Royal Navy fleet from his flagship, HMS Bedford. Thanks to the work of MI6 and the Chinese Intelligence Service, Kelly receives an urgent message from the Admiralty ordering the fleet to search for a nearby Stealth Ship belonging to the real orchestrator of the international crisis - media mogul, Elliot Carver. On-board the stealth ship, James Bond breaches its hull with an improvised explosive device, making the vessel visible to the Bedford's radar. Kelly orders the fleet not to fire on the Chinese and orders an explanatory signal be sent to the Chinese fleet commander. The Admiral orders the fleet to pursue and sink the stealth ship. With the radar contact too weak for a missile lock, the Bedford opens fire on the fleeing craft with its 4.5 inch naval gun; assisted by the disabling of its engines by Bond's Chinese companion, Wai Lin. 007 completely destroys the vessel by sabotaging a stolen cruise missile on-board. The Bedford and its crew are subsequently seen searching for Bond among the wreckage.

A minor henchman portrayed by the late British actor and stuntman, Terry Richards, the character appeared briefly in the 1997 James Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies.
He was one of several unidentified security guards seen during a party celebrating the launch of a new CMGN satellite at Elliot Carver's Hamburg media center. During the event, the media mogul meets with British spy James Bond (who posing as a banker) but sensing that the agent means trouble, he uses a pretext to leave him and tells his right-hand man, Stamper, to take care of him. The latter sends the unnamed guard together with two other henchmen to lure Bond into a room behind the stage under the the pretext of a phone call. The henchmen brutally beat 007, but are soon outwitted by him. During the fight, Bond makes another henchman punch the guard right into the face by ducking away in the exact same moment, knocking him unconscious. The guard only awakens after Bond has interrupted Carver's speech by switching off the electricity and it is unknown what happened to him afterwards.
"
1491,/wiki/Charmian_Bond,"Charmian Bond was James Bond's paternal Aunt who lived in a small village called Pett Bottom, Canterbury. She became his legal guardian when he was 11 years old, after the death of his parents.
After teaching James at home since the death of his parents, Charmian sent her nephew James to Eton College one semester into the year when he was 13 years old. While he was at school, she went to Scotland to look after her ill older brother Max Bond. However, as the year went on, Max's condition began to decline, so she sent James a train ticket in the mail alongside a note explaining the situation, and had James come to join them. She met him at the station, and drove to Max's estate in her Bentley 4½ Litre, where she her brother him for attempting to take James's bags in his condition. The boys then entertained themselves, and on the second night, Charmian took James to the circus, where she met her friend Annie Kelley, and her nephew Red Kelley whom James had met on the train. They returned home satisfied, and the next day, she stayed in with Max while James spent the day with Red. When he returned later that night, he asked if the next day he could go camping with the boy, and while Charmian was initially apprehensive, she arranged to prepare them a first aid kit and pack him a lunch for the following day before going to bed.
The next morning around 4 AM, Charmian was awakened by Max shouting in the other room. He called out James' name in his sleep before surrendering to his condition. With little time to mourn, Char was told by Red Kelly that James was danger at Lord Hellebore's castle. When she arrived, she found James unconscious, being watched by Wilder Lawless, while the castle burned behind them. James was deemed too weak to be taken to the hospital at Kilcraymore, and was unconscious in bed for ten days. Char often talked to him while he slept, and while she was out of the room, he awoke. They boy had gotten a bad cut on his cheek, but Char did not expect it would leave any lasting mark. He slowly recovered and one day she found him by the river feeling much better but wondering about Max. Char explained that he had passed, and that his condition was much worse than they had let on. The two attended a memorial service, where Max was mourned by many friends, and James returned to Eton, while Char returned to her home at Pett Bottom.
While James is on long leave from Eaton, he spent his weekend with his aunt at her cottage. The two of them enjoyed a picnic lunch. There, James told Charmian that he was interested in joining his teacher Peter Haight's expedition to Sardinia. Charmian noted that James could spend the beginning of the holidays with her before she departed for Brazil. She further suggested that James join his cousin Victor Delacroix in Capo D'orso at some point during the expedition and that Charmian would write to him to inform him of James' intentions. James then asked Charmian about certain tattoos which gave Charmian an opportunity to elaborate upon the history of tattoos in relation to widespread gang use. Later, as James was leaving her cottage, Charmian stuffed a letter from James' teacher Merriotte into his pocket.
"
1492,/wiki/Dr._Julius_No_(Literary),"Although the film and novel are similar in plot, the backgrounds for Julius No carry certain differences. Born in Peking, he was the illegitimate son of a German Methodist missionary and a Chinese girl, but his mother's aunt was paid to raised him. When older, he went to Shanghai, where he became involved with the Tongs, a Chinese crime syndicate. Later he was smuggled to the United States and settled in New York City, where he became a clerk and eventually Treasurer for a Tong in America, called the ""Hip-Sings.""
In the late 1920s, a mob war broke out in New York, forcing the police to crack down on them. No stole a million dollars in gold from the Tongs and disappeared. But the Tongs tracked him down and tortured him to find the location of the gold. When No did not tell them, the Tongs cut off his hands, shot him through the heart and left him for dead. No survived, due to a condition called dextrocardia, in which his heart was on the right side of the body.
Dr. No wanted his gold to be portable so he traded it all in for rare stamps, that would be easily transportable and maintain their value. He changed his appearance with surgery and later hid out in a medical school where he gained an interest of the human body and mind.
No spent a long time in hospital, then enrolled in medical school in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It is unclear if he completed his studies, but he adopted the title of Doctor and changed his name (his birth name is unknown) to Julius No, symbolic of his rejection of his father, whose given name was Julius. As in the film, No fitted himself with metal manual prostheses, but the book describes them as simple pincers (apparently similar to those of Tee-Hee Johnson in Live and Let Die), and judging by the lack of descriptive detail, they presumably lack the articulation of human hands.
With the million dollars from the Tong, he purchased rare stamps in order to preserve his money against inflation; he later purchased the island of Crab Key, off the coast of Jamaica, where he re-started a defunct guano business as a cover for his proposed criminal operations. He employs Jamaican and Cuban labourers on good wages for the guano works, brutally supervised by Chinese-Negroes ('Chigroes,' a portmanteau of Chinese & Negroes) from Jamaica. No one who comes to the island is allowed to leave.
Dr. No, with aid from the Soviet Union, sabotaged nearby American missile tests by jamming their signals and making them land and explode on a different target than that planned. This forced the Americans to spend time and money redesigning their missiles. He also recovered missiles from the ocean and turned them over to the Russians. James Bond did not actually learn of No's devious plot until after infiltrating Crab Key with Quarrel, where he was captured.
Bond ended up being captured by Dr. No, who told him about his life and revealed his latest plans for power. Dr. No was working with the Soviet Union with a plan to control missiles with a powerful radio beam. He could then land the rockets and sell the designs, blow up any desired target or even make them blow up in big city's so the missile test centres would have to be shut down. He could sell these things for millions of dollars.
Dr. No then revealed his plan to test human endurance using Bond and Honey Ryder. He tied Honey to some rocks, where hundreds of vicious crabs would slowly eat away at her. He put bond through a cruel test of pain, making him climb through boiling hot pipes and crawl past poisonous spiders while being monitored. Dr. No however had not been as careful as he should have been, and Bond had managed to slip a dinner knife and lighter into his possession.
Bond managed to escape after he was plunged into the sea, climbing back onto the mountain and following a path to where Dr. No was. Dr. No was supervising the shipment of bird dung which was to be used as fertilizer. A crane was controlling a pipe with a continuous flow of the dried bird dung. Bond killed the crane driver and took over, swinging the crane around until the pipe was over Dr. No's head. Dr. No choked as the horrible dust clogged his lungs and he was then covered with a twenty foot high pile of dung.
Years after his apparent death at Crab Key, No resurfaced under the name of Mr. Huliraya and became one of the wealthiest businessmen in all of India. At some point he replaced his claws with advanced mechanical hands that he covered with black gloves. No partnered with Dr. Frank Mulroy, an Optic Physics expert from the United States in coordinating attacks on airplanes that were carrying No's business rivals as well as foreign diplomats, so as to give him cover from his activities under the guise of being the Palestinian terrorist group Eblis' doings. They managed this with their Hotshot cannon, a solar death ray mounted to the deck of No's oil tanker Shirkahn. After kidnapping Palestinian independence activist Fatima Khalid, James Bond quickly tracked her down and thwarted No's plans again before destroying his tanker by exploding the fuel tank and the Hotshot weapon.
He is described as being an extremely tall and thin Chinese man with a round head and pointed chin. He wears a gunmetal grey kimono and a walkie talkie around his neck. In the book, the Doctor's hands are cut off by the Tongs as revenge for embezzlement and are replaced by steel pincers.

1494,/wiki/Holly_Goodhead_(Lois_Chiles),"Dr. Holly Goodhead is a fictional CIA agent from the film Moonraker. In the film, her role was played by American actress Lois Chiles.
The CIA became suspicious of Hugo Drax when some person or persons unknown literally hijacked a Moonraker space shuttle right off the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft on which it was riding at the time, killing its RAF crew and destroying said aircraft. The problem: not a trace of the Moonraker remained. The British, realizing their own embarrassment, sent an expert operative of their own: Commander James Bond alias Agent 007.
Investigating the theft of the Drax Industries Moonraker, Bond proceeds to the Drax Industries shuttle-manufacturing complex where he meets Hugo Drax and his henchman Chang. It is there that James Bond meets Goodhead and survives an assassination to Chang attempt via a centrifuge chamber.
Bond again encounters Goodhead in Venice where he is chased through the canals by Hugo Drax's henchmen. He discovers a secret biological laboratory, and by accidentally poisoning the scientists there, he learns that the glass vials are to hold a nerve gas deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Bond also finds evidence that Drax is moving his operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces that she is a CIA agent spying on Drax. They promise to work together, but quickly dispense with the truce. Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory, giving it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro.
In Rio, Bond meets Goodhead at the top of Sugarloaf Mountain, where they are attacked by Jaws on a cable car. After dispatching Jaws, Bond and Goodhead are captured by henchmen, but Bond escapes and reports to an MI6 base in Brazil. Bond travels the Amazon River looking for Drax's research facility and after finding it is captured by Jaws again. Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole the Moonraker because another in the fleet had developed a fault during assembly. 
Bond is later reunited with Goodhead and Drax announced that she and James would burn to death under the fire from the engines of a Moonraker-marked Moonraker Five, the fifth of six that were taking off that day from that secret base. But of course Drax couldn't hang about to see his work through. That gave Bond, who had some self-defense equipment of his own, time to blow off a ventilation grille and lead her into a ventilation duct before Moonraker Five took off. They then made their way to the service tunnels, where they ambushed two henchmen, knocked them unconscious, and took the places of the pilot and co-pilot of Moonraker Six. Moonraker Six had a pre-programmed flight plan and thus carried Bond and Goodhead all the way to their destination.  
Happily, Goodhead knew how to fly a Moonraker shuttle. So it was easy for her to manage the jettisoning of the solid-rocket boosters, and then of the external tank, at the proper time. Bond, however, sat before that part of the pilots' console that included the cargo-bay monitors. He switched one on, and discovered they were carrying no cargo, but only passengers.
Their destination turns out to be a city-sized space station that Goodhead could plainly see but did not register on radar. That could mean only that the station had a radar jammer on board, making the station invisible to the world below. 
Eventually they docked with the station and Drax explains his plan. He intends to destroy human life by launching fifty globes containing an orchid-derived nerve gas that would kill people but not animals. Before launching the globes, Drax says that he also transported several dozen genetically perfect young men and women of varying races to the space station.
In due time, the gaseous poisons from the orchid would evaporate into the mesosphere, and the attractive couples would return to Earth, most having likely become impregnated while in space, where Drax believes would make a perfect Earth free that is peaceful, pollution-free and one of income equality.
Drax also sees these babies to be as growing up to look to the space god who bestowed on them this perfect world - clearly himself, and also says these attractive couples will breed out medical problems such as Down syndrome or multiple sceloris. In case a baby is born deformed, it will be euthanized, as it is unfit for Drax's utopia. This megalomania, however, causes Jaws to realize the truth, and to defect to Bond and Goodhead.
Bond and Goodhead free themselves from Drax's henchmen and disable Drax's jamming equipment. With the radar jammer disabled, Drax's station becomes visible to Washington. After getting confirmation from General Gogol that Moscow did not authorize that station, the U.S. government deploys a space shuttle full of Unoted States Marines to capture or destroy Drax's station. During the ensuing battle Drax is blown out an airlock and the station begins to tear itself apart. Goodhead pilots Moonraker Five and uses the shuttle's laser to destroy the deadly globes that Drax had already launched.
After their task is complete, Bond suggested they could land, either at Vandenberg, or White Sands or Edwards AFB; but Holly begs Bond to ""take her around the world one more time"". So they do one ninety-minute orbit and celebrate their victory in a most intimate fashion.

1496,/wiki/Goldeneye:_The_Secret_Life_Of_Ian_Fleming,"Goldeneye: The Secret Life Of Ian Fleming is a 1989 television film starring Charles Dance as Ian Fleming.
The film is a fact-based biography of James Bond author, Ian Fleming, focusing on his wartime exploits and romantic adventures, which ultimately led to his creation of the super-spy.

The film begins with opening credits, during which a car drives down a Jamaican road to Goldeneye. The car’s occupants are Ann Fleming, her friend Loeila, and Noel Coward, who get out of the car singing “Let’s Fall in Love,” only to be shushed by a man who tells them that a movie is being filmed. As the scene continues, we see Fleming being interviewed. The interviewer asks him why he began writing; Fleming says he’d turned 40, and needed to take his mind off the shock of getting married. He goes on to defend his books’ sex and violence. The interviewer asks Fleming if he is himself a version of Bond; Fleming demurs, claiming to be nowhere near as capable as Bond. The interviewer asks him he was in the Secret Service; Fleming says he was not, although he also says that the one person who would never tell you whether he was a secret agent is a secret agent. He allows as to how he could recount one incident he was involved in with the CIA, and we flash back in time.
Fleming arrives in New York to conclude his wartime training: he has been tasked with assassinating a Chinese agent. Upon landing, me meets is friend Ivar Bryce, who will serve him in a support capacity.  The two of them meet William Stephenson, a Canadian who served as a major British intelligence officer during the Second World War. Fleming, Bryce, and Stephenson go to a firing range, where Fleming practices his skill against a moving target; Stephenson seems impressed but notes that Fleming will need to make his kill on the first shot, or else be killed himself. Bryce takes Fleming to a bar – “a bit of a dive,” Fleming remarks – which the Chinese agent frequents. The bar is run entirely by Jamaicans, and it doesn't take long for Fleming to obviously become a bit enamored with it. Fleming catches a glimpse of his target; and the target catches a glimpse of him.
Later, Fleming sits in his hotel bathroom, steeling his nerve; his target also prepares himself for the confrontation he clearly knows is looming, exercising in his own hotel room. Fleming takes a taxi to the target’s hotel; there has apparently been a murder outside the hotel. Undaunted, Fleming proceeds inside. The desk clerk informs someone that he is on his way; these, seemingly, are agents in a neighboring building, who look across the way at the Chinese agent and signal to him that Fleming is on his way up.  We see an eye looking in on the Chinese man from a hole in the wall. Fleming reaches the target’s room: 1007. The “1” has fallen partway off, so the door appears to read “007.” Fleming hesitates, seemingly unsure. Resolved, he kicks the door entirely off its hinges and points his gun at the quarry, who stands stone still. 
Fleming is unable to pull the trigger. Stephenson appears out of nowhere; seemingly, he was the man whose eye we glimpsed earlier. “Kill him,” he says, but Fleming seems unable.  “Then I’ll kill him,” Stephenson says. He begins firing, and the Chinese agent goes into a series of wild gymnastics, dodging Stephenson’s bullets. The entire scenario has been a training exercise, one that Fleming evidently has – not entirely to the CIA’s surprise – failed.  Inspector Chang is on loan from the Hong Kong bureau, and he is rather better at dodging bullets than Fleming is at firing them.
Fleming and Stephenson go to a bar and have martinis; “shaken, not stirred,” Stephenson proclaims, and the drink is very much to Fleming’s taste. He asks Stephenson for a favor: the British need a German U-boat, with a complete set of codes. Stephenson only knows one man in the world who can get that for them: Lucky Luciano. So, they go visit Luciano in prison, and in exchange for a post-war vacation to Italy, Luciano says he will arrange it.  Luciano says they will deliver the U-boat to the British in Jamaica.
Sometime later, back in London (where preparations for air raids are in full effect), a young blonde woman in the Naval Services – Lieutenant Marianne Bearing  – enters an admiral’s office, and is given orders to find Fleming and drag him out of whatever bed he is in.
The admiral wonders if Fleming has gone through with some hair-brained scheme involving getting a pair of German prisoners of war to give him some vital information. Bearing does not know, but requests the authority to do whatever it takes to bring Fleming; the authority is given.
Sure enough, Fleming is in a nightclub, with Lady Ann O’Neill, who is assisting him in trying to pull off his scheme: to ply the two Germans – one of whom is played by a young Christoph Waltz – with drink and food in an attempt to learn how the German U-boats made it through the British minefields near Norway. Ann speculates that she might have more luck seducing them.  A shadowy figure observes them from a balcony.
Fleming and O’Neill drop the POWs back at their barracks; their fact-finding mission has failed. As they drive off, a figure on a motorcycle pursues them. The driver deposits Ann at her home, and Fleming gently chides her for being married to one man but being a mistress to at least two others (Lord Rothermere and himself).
Fleming’s driver takes him home. As they drive, Fleming notices that the car is being pursued by a  motorcyclist, who overtakes them, passes them, and shoots a look backward. 
As Fleming gets out of the car, he seems worried, and air-raid sirens punctuate the atmosphere. A figure leaps at him, pins him against a wall then rips off its helmet, revealing – of course – Lieutenant Bearing, who kisses Fleming passionately. Fleming leads her inside, straight to the bedroom; but Bearing informs him that she is under orders to get him out of bed. He is also supposed to come with her. Bearing complains of having gotten an awful lot of dust down her back; it seems to be collecting in her boots, and even inside her trousers, and Fleming allows as to how they’d better get them off.
Fleming reports for duty, first hobknobbing with Admiral Godfrey’s starchy secretary. The two of them flirt about a hypothetical week of golf they could share; “Your balls or mine?” Fleming asks.
The Admiral asks Fleming if he has been hit by the odd bomb; Fleming allows he has had a dusty near-miss. The Admiral informs him that he is being sent to Jamaica to investigate reports of a German U-boat being in the area. His old friend Ivar Bryce will be there, and the two of them are to stay until the matter is resolved. Admiral Godfrey is sure they will be miserable.  Godfrey also has a gift from the Americans (for Fleming’s apparent help in writing the blueprints for their “secret intelligence setup”): a Colt .765 automatic pistol.
Fleming returns home, and flings his hat onto a coat rack. He hears noises, and takes his new Colt out, he finds Ann in his bedroom, forlorn as a result of the news that her husband has died in Italy. “Death was his best revenge,” she says; she seems convinced that Lord Rothermere will want to marry her now, and even though she says she does not love him, the implication is that she will have no choice but to accept.
Later, in Jamaica, Fleming and Bryce lounge around outside the villa where they are staying, and Fleming expresses a desire to live there permanently. He asks Bryce to arrange for him to buy a piece of land; “I’m serious,” he says, “I’m going to spend the rest of my life in Jamaica.” He declares his intent to write the spy story to end all spy stories. Fleming grabs Birds of the West Indies and says he’ll call his spy James Bond.
Fleming and Bryce meet with a rather portly Admiral – “Good lord,” says Bryce; “is that one Admiral or two?” – and swim out to the U-boat to open it. They get inside and retrieve the codes from the submerged vessel, and somehow sink it. The admiral is nonplussed by the entire affair.
Fleming and Bryce float down a river, and discuss Fleming’s parents a bit. Fleming says that his mother always said he would never really fall in love; “funny, that,” he says, presumably referring obliquely to Ann. He goes on to say that he sort of associates love with pain and loss.  “This place is dangerous,” Fleming says; “its beauty, I mean.” “That’s why you bottle up all your feelings,” Bryce speculates. “That’s what M always said,” replies Fleming. Bryce asks who “M” is, and is told that it stands for “Mama.”
At a piano recital, Ann and Lil talk – to the chagrin of the people around them – about the prospect of Ann marrying Lord Rothermere. Loelia wonders what she’ll tell Ian. Ann replies that she’ll tell him the truth, and says that Fleming has not asked her to marry him; he doesn’t want to marry anyone, evidently.
Later, Noel Coward is giving some sort of a recital himself – possibly an impromptu one – and Loelia continues to talk about Ann’s prospects, this time with a companion. Ann, meanwhile, dances with Ian. Afterward, she – seemingly having told Fleming that she will marry Rothermere – tells him that she does not expect him to be faithful to him. But she tells him that she loves him, and the two kiss.
Back at Naval Intelligence, Fleming flirts with Bearing a bit. He is out of cigarettes, and sends her out to get some for him.  An air raid commences, and she is killed in a blast.
Some time later, Rothermere and Ann visit Ian at a club and offer their condolences. “I didn’t know how much she meant to you,” says Rothermere.  “No; neither did I,” says Fleming wistfully. He tells Ann he is angry, because all the wrong people have died; he points out the indolent rich all around him.
Back at Naval Intelligence, Fleming finds that Godfrey is gone and has been replaced. The Admiral is none too pleased with Fleming’s record, especially with the five thousand pounds that went to Luciano. The Admiral seems to be putting an end to Fleming’s war. Chastened – or, perhaps, merely resigned – Fleming retreats to the outer office, where he pulls blueprints for Goldeneye out of a tube and hangs them on the wall; he sits, smoking and admiring them, contemplating the future ahead.
At a cinema, Churchill declares the European war to be at its conclusion. Fleming watches, with Ann at his side. Fleming asks if she will go with him to Jamaica; she says it is impossible, but says she will visit him there someday.
At Goldeneye, Fleming and Bryce look out on the sea. “It’s like a dream,” says Fleming, clearly enchanted. Later, he sits typing at a desk.
One morning, Coward brings Fleming mail and a couple of telegraphs. Among the correspondence: Ann, declaring her wish to be allowed to come and see Fleming’s home. He smiles.  We hear Ann’s voice as he reads the letter, and as Ann speaks, there is a time jump; Fleming, some time later, is sitting at his writing desk, reading the letter again, clearly moved. 
We hear his written reply, which includes an invitation for her to be the first person in the world to read about James Bond. “What do you think of the title Casino Royale?” he asks. Someone calls for his presence, and he goes outside.  He is, obviously, hosting a small party at his home, attended by Coward – who is singing – and Bryce and Loelia, among others. Fleming, however, stays more or less in the shadows.
There follows a sequence in which a woman rises – not unlike Honey Ryder – out of the surf and approaches Fleming. The two of them join hands and go off together, and there is then a scene of the two of them spending time together on a boat.
Ian and Loelia meet Anne at the airfield. Later, Ann paints a portrait of Goldeneye while Ian gives her on update on what James Bond has been up to.  (He’s evidently just earned his Double-0 status at Royale les Eaux.) The two of them behave as lovebirds, and Loelia declares her boredom with the whole affair. She stalks off, waking Coward from a nap to join her.  Later, Ann and Ian, silhouetted against the setting sun, kiss. Even later, they lounge in the midnight surf. This is paradise.
Back in London, Fleming is summoned to the offices of the Sunday Times. There, he is told by Lord Rothermere that Ann is pregnant by Fleming. He says that he wants the two to not see one another again, and storms out.
Later Fleming has a physical. The doctor tells him that his general state of health is alarming.
Fleming visits Ann and Rothermere in hospital. “Your child lived eight hours,” Rothermere says. Ann and Loelia discuss divorce and its downsides. Loelia says she feels Ann is less interested in divorce than in marriage and she knows who with.
Later Ann ties Ian up in bed, with Loelia in the next room. Ian proposes marriage; Ann accepts. Lil has to be called in to burn through the restraints. “This Bond thing has got most frightfully out of hand,” she says.
A Jamaican minister performs the wedding. Fleming’s housekeeper brings them a cake, which evidently is inedible. Later, Ian and Ann bury it on the beach while Coward sings a song he composed for the newlyweds.
We flash back forward in time, with Fleming talking about Coward’s having tied one of his own shoes to his car and driven off after the wedding. As the interview continues, a man walks up from the beach and introduces himself as “Bond; James Bond.” It is the ornithological author for whom Fleming named his character! Fleming autographs Birds of the West Indies for him.
Fleming and Ann visit a shabby cinema, where Dr. No is playing. Someone leaving is overheard saying that it isn’t as good as the book.  Cut to a reprise of the image of the lovers standing against the setting sun, and end credits roll.

1501,/wiki/Everything_or_Nothing,"James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing is a third-person shooter video game published by Electronic Arts. James Bond is modeled after and voiced by Pierce Brosnan, in his final performance in the role. It was developed by EA Redwood Shores and EA Canada for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Nintendo GameCube. The Game Boy Advance version was developed by Griptonite Games and when linked to the GameCube version via the GameCube–Game Boy Advance link cable allowed unique premium content. It's also the first James Bond game to use THX technology.
Everything or Nothing includes 29 missions as well as 4 unlockable bonus missions, numerous gadgets supplied by Q and the return of the Aston Martin V12 Vanquish from the 2002 film Die Another Day, which is considered as a continuation to the film.
James Bond Everything or Nothing opens in the mountains of Tajikistan where an arms trade is about to begin. The merchandise is a nuclear suitcase-bomb that was stolen from a stockpile of old Soviet Union weapons. James Bond is tasked with making sure that the trade is not completed. After Bond completes the mission, he is extracted via helicopter outside of the military base.
Afterwards, a Russian female scientist, named Dr. Katya Nadanova, of the Oxford Department of Microtechnology is kidnapped by a terrorist cell and is taken to their headquarters in southern Egypt. Her invention, a new kind of microtechnology used to enter electrical wires and repair damage at microscopic level, is also stolen. James Bond is once again called in to action. He destroys the stolen technology and chases after the terrorist's train managing to board stealthfully. Aboard, Bond has a confrontation with his old enemy: Jaws. The two fight and Bond wins. Arriving at an helipad-vagon, Bond sees Nadanova trapped with handcuffs at this vagon. The general escapes by helicopter and blows up a bridge, putting Bond and Nadanova into a trap. But there's still an helicopter, so they manage to escape before the train falls down the valley. They fly through the Valley of the Kings until Bond finally shoots the leader down. Bond drops off Katya at a nearby military complex, although unbeknownst to Bond, Katya meets with a Russian ex-KGB special officer turned businessman, named Nikolai Diavolo - the former protege of Max Zorin. During the meeting Katya delivers a small vial containing a mysterious substance to Diavolo.
Later, MI6 loses contact with 003, sent to investigate the mining of newly-discovered platinum reserves in western Peru. Bond is sent to a town on the Northwestern Peruvian coastline, located high above the Pacific Ocean on a series of cliffs. Bond learns that 003's last contact was with an American geologist named Serena St. Germaine. They meet and she takes him to the mining complex near ancient Incan ruins. Once there, Bond discovers 003 had been violently questioned by Nikolai Diavolo. Bond makes himself known to Diavolo and after shooting 003, Diavolo orders the guards to chase him through the mining complex and ruins. When Bond reaches 003 he tells Bond that Diavolo sets his plans in New Orleans but dies of blood loss. At the end of the mining tunnels, Bond reaches a cliff where a helicopter appears with Katya Nadanova in it, holding Serena hostage. She throws Serena out of the copter and Bond dives off the cliff after her. Dodging obstacles and enemy fire, he finally catches Serena and fires a grappling hook into the cliff wall. Upon returning to the town, Bond and Serena are met with military forces who are being paid off by Diavolo to protect him. Bond quickly returns Serena to her cottage in the dense forest, and goes on to reach the extraction point. Bond drives into a moving plane just as the military catches up with him.
MI6 had learned that Diavolo had employed an Interpol-sought war criminal named Arkady Yayakov. Yayakov secretly owns a night club in New Orleans along with the a local crime ring. Bond goes to New Orleans during Mardi Gras and stealthfully enters the night club where he meets Mya Starling, an NSA agent assigned to spy on Yayakov. Chaos erupts when Bond enters the main lounge of the club and Agent Starling's cover is blown. Yayakov kidnaps the NSA agent and leaves the club. Bond fights the thugs and chases Yayakov through an underground tunnel system that was used to traffic drugs and suchlike. Yayakov, Starling and Bond arrive in a gigantic 19th century graveyard. Yayakov hands over Agent Starling to Jean Le Rouge, a local mobster. Le Rouge and Bond run through the graveyard until they reach a crematorium where they have the final fight. Bond kills Le Rouge and saves Starling.
Bond is then sent to a remote area further north outside of New Orleans. At a secret lab inside an old, run-down villa, Bond discovers that Diavolo is using Yayakov to manipulate the purpose of Dr. Nadanova's microtechnology. They have managed to create a brand new weapon of mass destruction: microtechnology, infused with a natural chemical compound found only in the bayous of Louisiana, that literally eats away at all kinds of metal - save for platinum. Bond destroys the lab, killing Yayakov in the process but Jaws suddenly appears and smashes through the old villa, driving a platinum tanker truck filled with the metal-eating nanobots. Jaws' orders are to crash the truck into the levees that surround New Orleans and let the nanobots go to work destroying the levees, thus flooding New Orleans. Bond hops onto a motorcycle and chases Jaws across the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway and finally rams the truck off the bridge and into the lake below.
Later, MI6 learns that the operation in New Orleans was meant to be a test run for the metal-eating nanobots. James Bond returns to Peru to investigate what Diavolo plans to do with his new weapon. With the help of Serena St. Germaine, Bond infiltrates Diavolo's personal estate and covertly enters himself in a rally car race. The reward for coming in at first place is dinner with Diavolo. Naturally, Bond wins. However, Diavolo has already caught on to Bond's snooping around, and has both Bond and Serena captured. Bond breaks loose and manages to rescue Serena, killing a large number of Diavolo's henchmen in the process. Back together, Bond and Serena hijack one of the race cars and speed through town. Bond wants to see Diavolo's platinum mines first-hand. They go to the mines and Bond investigates. It is there when he learns of Nadanova's treachery and Bond escapes the mine, leaping through a hole in the rock where Serena is waiting in a helicopter.
Now in Russia, Diavolo uses his platinum army to break through to Red Square in Moscow and attempts to release toxic gas into the Kremlin. Preventing this, Bond discovers that there is a nuclear bunker under the Kremlin. Diavolo plans to launch several long-since decommissioned ballistic missiles - replacing their missing warheads with metal-eating Nanotech payloads. Rappelling down a large elevator shaft, 007 is confronted by Nadanova and escapes from her men by shooting out the elevator's brakes. As the platform plummets out of control, Bond and a flamethrower-wielding Jaws battle each-other; concluding with the spy using an aircraft's ejector seat to escape. The elevator violently crashes and Bond safely parachutes to the bottom of the shaft. He proceeds into the bunker and deactivates the missiles. While returning to the surface via the freight elevator, Diavolo and Nadanova attack Bond from an adjacent shaft using a Russian hoverjet. Bond destroys it, killing Nadanova, but Diavolo manages to eject just in time.
Diavolo makes his way to the surface, where he manually reactivates one of the missiles using a telemetry tower and aims it at London. Fighting through his remaining men, Bond destabilises the tower using a rocket launcher, causing Diavolo to plunge into the fiery missile silo below. However, Diavolo manages to press the launch button before falling and Bond is forced to use a nearby anti-aircraft turret to shoot down the missile. Catastrophe averted, 007 meets Serena outside the Kremlin and embraces her.

1502,/wiki/Bill_Tanner_(Michael_Kitchen),"Bill Tanner is the fictional Chief of Staff for the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6). Based on the recurring literary character, who first appeared in the 1955 Ian Fleming novel Moonraker, he was portrayed by English actor Michael Kitchen in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye and 1999's The World Is Not Enough.
Tanner is only briefly seen in the Situation Room when the GoldenEye weapon is set off over Severnaya. Tanner gets scolded here for calling the new M, ""the Evil Queen of Numbers"" while she is right behind him. He then gives her and James Bond a briefing of the GoldenEye weapon and the specifications of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) technology.
Tanner is seen at the castle in Scotland at an MI6 debriefing the agents on the murder of Sir Robert King, father of Elektra King. When Bond comes to the conclusion that Renard is behind it, Tanner is seen with them talking about what Renard can do or is planning to do. He is only seen again twice, when Elektra King contacts M to get her to come and see her and finally at the end of the film where R is attempting to find Bond using a camera in Istanbul.
As Michael Kitchen was unable to reprise his role for Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), the character of Charles Robinson (played by Colin Salmon), was created in his stead. Kitchen was the first actor to portray Tanner more than once in film.  Both characters later appeared in The World Is Not Enough (1999).

1505,/wiki/GoldenEye_(2010_video_game),"GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter video game published by Activision. It is a reimagining of 1997 video game GoldenEye 007, itself based on the 1995 film GoldenEye. The game was officially announced by Nintendo at their E3 2010 conference presentation. The game was released on November 2, 2010 in tandem with another James Bond game, James Bond 007: Blood Stone. It took on the elements of a modern shooter while retaining a classic name. A remastering of the Wii game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in 2011, re-titled as GoldenEye 007: Reloaded.
Although Pierce Brosnan starred as James Bond in GoldenEye' and was featured in the 1997 game GoldenEye 007, subsequent Bond actor Daniel Craig's likeness and voice are featured in the 2010 game and the plot has been modified to fit with the current style of James Bond films. Judi Dench, who has portrayed M since GoldenEye, reprises her role for the game. With the exception of M, all other main characters from the film have had their appearances altered, though they still retain their original names.
Unlike the original video game and therefore movie, the whole story takes place after the Cold War due to the Soviet Union's replacement by the Russian Federation, so the story does not jump nine years ahead after the opening sequence. 
Since the release of Spectre, the events of the game have been contradictory and are rendered as non-canon.
The story is set some time after the events of Quantum of Solace but prior to Skyfall.  It begins with James Bond (007) and Alec Trevelyan (006) on a mission infiltrating a chemical weapons facility in Arkhangelsk, Russia, which is believed to be the source of weapons used by a terrorist cell to target British embassies around the world. The mission goes awry when Trevelyan is caught and apparently shot by General Arkady Ourumov. Bond escapes by detonating explosives he had placed throughout the facility, and fighting his way out, with playable options to use the facility's missile embankments to destroy attacking helicopters before stealing a motorcycle and chasing a plane on the runway. With its pilot killed in the firefight, Bond is forced to chase it off a cliff and steady the controls, fleeing Arkhangelsk.
Afterward, Bond reports on his mission, and receives intel on a phone call intercepted from Ourumov connects him to Russian gangster Valentin Zukovsky as Ourumov attempts to acquire a helicopter that has been modified to survive an electromagnetic pulse attack. Bond travels to Zukovsky's nightclub in Barcelona, Spain, and through Sergeant Garcia local police mole placed inside Zukovsky's nightclub, Bond is able to make contact with the Russian and inquires about the helicopter. Zukovsky directs him to an arms fair in Dubai before being killed by Xenia Onatopp, disguised as a waitress in Zukovsky's club and has the murder pinned on Bond.
Bond tracks Onatopp to the same arms fair Zukovsky mentioned, but is unable to stop Onatopp and Ourumov from stealing the EMP-resistant helicopter. He is, however, able to plant his smartphone on-board, and MI6 is able to track the helicopter to Severnaya, a remote base in Siberia which the Russians claim is being used to observe the effects of climate change. In reality, it is a tracking system for ""GoldenEye"", a series of nuclear weapons in orbit designed to disable an enemy target with an electromagnetic pulse upon detonation, except for Bond's new smart phone that was EMP hardened. Bond is unable to stop the theft of the GoldenEye weapons satellite, with Ourumov detonating one of the satellites in orbit so as to cover up the theft. Negotiating his way through the lower levels of the Severnaya facility, Bond rescues Natalya Simonova before being arrested by the Russian army.
Believing Bond and Natalya to be responsible for the GoldenEye blast, Russian Defense Minister Dmitri Mishkin interrogates the two in St. Petersburg, but is interrupted by Ourumov - now working for The Janus Group, a shadowy PMC, murders Mishkin and abducts Natalya. Bond pursues Ourumov through the Russian military archives, before hijacking a tank and chasing Ourumov. Ourumov leads Bond to a rail yard where he boards a train with Xenia. Bond derails their carriage by crashing into it with the tank, leading to a confrontation with Ourumov over his plan for the GoldenEye satellite. He attempts to pit Ourumov and Xenia against one another, but Xenia betrays Ourumov and kills him. Bond is able to help Natalya off the train before it explodes and Natalya admits she overheard Ourumov arranging a meeting with someone for that night.
Bond goes to the meeting in Ourumov's place and is shocked to learn that Trevelyan survived his execution at the hands of Ourumov and is now Janus, the head of the Janus crime syndicate and the mastermind behind the GoldenEye theft. Trevelyan expresses disdain for his previous life, claiming that where they once fought for Queen and country, their cause had become corrupted by bankers and financiers seeking to make billions of dollars in profit by manipulating the course of governments around the world. He then leaves with Natalya, who is instrumental to his plan now that Ourumov is dead.
MI6 traces Trevelyan to a solar energy station in Nigeria. Bond is able to infiltrate the facility, killing Xenia in the process. Trevelyan's plan is to steal billions of dollars from all the banks in London and everything the banks have touched (stock markets, financial records, etc.) before detonating the second GoldenEye satellite, erasing all evidence of the theft, using Natalia's fingerprint; Bond, however, is able to trick him into destroying his own supercomputers before telling Natalya to deorbit the satellite. Trevelyan then makes his way to the top of the satellite array to defend the override module that will sabotage it; after fighting Trevelyan, Bond is able to overload the facility control room, causing the entire facility to collapse around them. Bond shoots Trevelyan, sending him to his death over the edge of the tower. Natalya has a helicopter piloted by a Janus man at gunpoint to pick up James and they soon get away as the station is destroyed. Landing a few miles from the station, MI6 arrest the pilot while James and Natalia get out and look at each other before being interrupted by M's phone call, congratulating him about the station's destruction and wants a report. Natalia throws the smart phone away and James and Natalia soon kiss.
Since GoldenEye 007 serves as a re-imagining of the film, rather than an accurate portrayal, the game does have some noticeable differences. Levels have been altered to reflect the game's modified story. According to Craig Harris of IGN, ""GoldenEye still retains the basics of GoldenEye's story, but retells it in a way that makes sense with Daniel Craig's interpretation of James Bond."" Likewise, the game features modern game elements to coincide with other modern first person shooters, such as destructible environments and online multiplayer.
Eurocom has also added a few updated features while retaining some features from the original game. Instead of a watch, players use a mobile phone to scan documents, take photos, and communicate with MI6. The original GoldenEye 007 featured a cheat menu which is available from the start in the re-make. The game updates the AI-Bot system which is built upon Eurocom's previous game, Dead Space: Extraction. Each computer player possesses its own AI-bot system to make them dynamic and challenging. The game, despite having a regenerating health system, contains a throw back to the orginial GoldenEye 007's health system with the 007 Classic single player difficulty. In this single player mode, the player has non-regenerating health and can pick up armor like in the classic GoldenEye.
The game offers players several choices of controllers: Wii Remote with Nunchuk, Wii Zapper, Classic Controller, Classic Controller Pro, or a Nintendo GameCube controller. GoldenEye 007 also provides players using the Remote with Nunchuk or Wii Zapper with the ability to peer around cover by tilting the Nunchuk. The game includes twenty-five weapons based upon counterparts from the Bond franchise.
GoldenEye 007 features both offline split screen for up to four local players and online play for up to eight players. There are 10 multiplayer maps. There are four different game modes for offline multiplayer and nine different game modes for online multiplayer. Online multiplayer is provided through the free Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, and though up to eight players can connect to a game remotely, only one local player is allowed at a time. Multiplayer includes characters from the single player campaign, such as James Bond and Alec Trevelyan, as well as classic Bond-series characters including Jaws, Oddjob, and Julius No. Additionally, online multiplayer offers XP progression, unlockables and multipliers. Split screen combat provides over a dozen modifiers, including Paintball Mode from the original game.
During November 2006, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime announced that Nintendo was exploring the possibility of adding the Nintendo 64 classic GoldenEye 007 to the Virtual Console, despite a complicated situation in which the game's developer Rare is owned by Microsoft (producers of the rival Xbox 360 console) and the video game rights to the James Bond franchise are held by Activision. He stated, ""We would love to see it [on the Virtual Console], so we're exploring all the rights issues. On January 7, 2008, Xbox Evolved reported that an updated version of GoldenEye 007 would be released on Xbox Live Arcade. However on January 11, 2008, 1UP.com reported that a GoldenEye port (as opposed to a remake) had been in development at Rare for several months, but stated that the title would not be released on the [[Wikipedia:Xbox Live Arcade]|Xbox Live Arcade]] since ""Microsoft and Nintendo couldn't agree on the financial side of things"". As of November 2011, Microsoft has made no comment on further effort to acquire the rights to the game and release GoldenEye 007 on XBLA. It was revealed at E3 2010 that a new Goldeneye video game would be released for the Wii in November 2010. GoldenEye 007 is built on a modified version of the game engine from another Wii game by Eurocom, Dead Space: Extraction.
Originally, Free Radical Design (now Crytek UK) were approached by Activision to develop the game because former Rare staff were working there, however the deal was never finalised.
David Arnold, composer of every Bond film score since Tomorrow Never Dies, composed the game's score. Nicole Scherzinger performs the title song, a cover version of the film's theme which was originally performed by Tina Turner. The game's script is penned by Bruce Feirstein. Rory Kinnear reprises his role as Bill Tanner, M's Chief of Staff.
Reviews for GoldenEye 007 have been mostly positive. GameRankings's aggregated review score for the game is 83.77% as of May 4, 2011, based on 62 reviews, about 13% less than the original game. IGN awarded the game a 9.0 out of 10 and an Editor's Choice Award, praising its multiplayer component and its well-crafted story while criticizing the lack of voice chat. The reviewer, Craig Harris, concluded by acknowledging that the game—as of its release—is the Wii's best first person shooter. Gaming Nexus gave GoldenEye 007 an A–, stating, ""instead of standing in the original GoldenEye's shadow, Eurocom has created a brand new game that is just as compelling and addictive as the original."" GameSpot reviewer Tom McShea also praised the game, awarding it an 8.5 out of 10. Joystiq scored the game 4 out of 5. Nintendo World Report awarded the game an 8.5/10, with the reviewer stating, ""Frankly, I haven't seen a more impressive Wii shooter."" The Official Nintendo Magazine gave GoldenEye 007 a score of 90%. GameTrailers scored the game at 8.6 of 10, indicating that while most aspects are well-done, the game's performance suffers from inconsistent framerates, particularly during splitscreen play. They also derided the menus as ""bland"" and the ""not very crisp"" overall picture due to aliasing. Digital Trends' gave the game 8 of 10, complaining of the enemy AI's simplistic strategies and lack of adaptability. While the multiplayer gameplay was highly praised by the reviewer, the lack of voice chat was seen as a significant omission.
GamesRadar, although less positive, were still pleased with the result, awarding the game a 7 out of 10, stating that it was impossible for the game to live up to the original, but that it was still ""a damn fine, 'serious' shooter on the Wii, and that's saying something,"" adding that ""even without the limited options for mature action for Wii owners, GoldenEye 007 is a solid game in its own right."" In contrast, however, Game Informer was less impressed, giving the game a 6.5/10, calling it ""a lackluster game that fails to hit the same high notes of the original, or keep pace with modern shooters"".

At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Activision unveiled GoldenEye 007: Reloaded, a remastering of the Wii game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles. The game features high-definition graphics due to running on a new game engine, an achievement system, new ""Mi6 Ops Missions"", and PlayStation Move compatibility for the PS3 version. On September 14, 2011, Activision announced plans to release an exclusive PlayStation 3 bundle called GoldenEye 007: Reloaded - Double 'O' Edition, which would include access to the downloadable character Hugo Drax. The bundle would include a PlayStation Move motion controller, navigation controller, PlayStation Eye camera, and Sharp Shooter peripheral along with the game. The game was released on November 1, 2011 in North America and on November 4, 2011 in Europe.
GoldenEye 007 features online play for up to 16 players. There are 14 multiplayer maps. There are nine different game modes for online multiplayer.

1506,/wiki/Graves,"Founder and owner of the Graves CorporationColonel Tan-Sun Moon, later known as Sir Gustav Graves, was a fictional North Korean military colonel who attempted to unite the Korean peninsula under his county's flag. After his presumed death at the hands of James Bond, he changed his appearance to infiltrate the society he intended to destroy; becoming a charismatic diamond magnate.
Portrayed jointly by Korean-American actor, Will Yun Lee, (as Moon) and British actor, Toby Stephens, (as Graves) the character served as the main antagonist of the 2002 James Bond film, Die Another Day. He was also featured in Raymond Benson's accompanying novelisation and was re-imagined for Activision's 2012 James Bond video game, 007 Legends.
Born the son General Moon, Tan-Sun Moon was a Colonel (Sangchwa) in the North Korean People's Army. In a hope that a Western education would help bridge the gap between East and West, General Moon sent his son to study at Oxford and Harvard. It was an experience which would prove formative on the young Moon, providing him with the contacts which he would later use; including Miranda Frost who was on also on the Harvard fencing team. He was able to bring Frost to his side by arranging her to win the Olympic Gold Medal in fencing by implicating her competitor for using steroids. General Moon would later regret the decision, coming to believe that his son had become corrupted by the ideas and greed of the West.
A radical and a dealer in hi-tech weaponry, Moon conducted various illicit operations in diamond  smuggling to fund his private army and ambitions to forcibly unite the two Koreas. He had his base set up in the middle of the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. He also had assistance from a fellow Korean officer named Tang Lin Zao. MI6 becomes aware of his activities, however, and dispatches three agents, including James Bond, to assassinate Moon by intercepting and replacing a diamond smuggler named Van Bierk.
When Zao finds out that Bond is in truth a British spy sent to kill him, Moon uses to destroy the helicopter Bond arrived in with one of his high-tech weapons, called Tankbuster, killing the two remaining agents. Before he can kill Bond too, Moon is told that General Moon is about to arrive at the base. The Colonel and his men then quickly leave the base with the hovercrafts and weapons, so that his father doesn't find out about his weapon dealing. He leaves Bond to be shot by his men but the agent escapes by blowing up the diamond suitcase, having implanted a bomb earlier, and fleeing with the last remaining hovercraft. Pursuing Moon, Bond has to fight off many Korean soldiers while being shot at by Moon with his Tankbuster and a flamethrower.
Eventually jumping onto Moon's hovercraft, Bond attacks the young military and the two fight long enough for the hovercraft to reach a cliff. Without a pilot to steer it the hovercraft drives right over the cliff into the river far below. Bond is able to jump off in time, but Moon is dragged over the cliff and presumed deceased. Right after, Bond is arrested by General Moon and his soldiers, and brought to a North Korean torture camp where he is brutally interrogated for before being exchanged for Zao, who had been arrested by the British.
Unknown to the rest of the world - including his own father - Moon survives the incident and flees to Cuba, where he undergoes DNA replacement therapy (provided by Dr. Alvarez) to alter his appearance to make him appear to be of European descent. Emerging from the therapy, he completed his transformation and adopted the name Gustav Graves.
Gustav Graves was seen as a sophisticated, sarcastic, rude and arrogant business man. In a conversation with Bond later in the film, he admits that he modelled this new identity after him. He portrays himself to the world as an ecologist, fencing champion and adrenaline junkie, with a penchant for speed—activities which he has plenty of time for, given that the gene therapy has robbed him of the ability to sleep.
His official story was that he was an orphan who worked in diamond mines in Argentina; from there, he learned engineering and founded the Graves Corporation. He discovered a great mine of diamonds in Iceland and made a huge fortune. With that fortune, Graves developed Icarus - a satellite which harnesses solar energy and focuses it, ""gently"", over the Earth, supposedly putting an end to famine and poverty. In reality, his fortune was made using a fake diamond mine as a front for laundering African conflict diamonds and his Icarus satellite is a super-weapon. The main purpose of Icarus was to blast its way through the heavily-fortified demilitarized zone, providing a pathway for the invading North Korean forces and bringing about Korean unification.
Brought on Graves' trace through blood diamonds he found with Zao, Bond - unaware of Graves' true identity - travels to London, where he witnesses Graves arriving at the Buckingham Palace by parachute before he is knighted by the Queen. Later that day, Bond visits the fencing academy where Graves is training and manages to persuade the fight trainer Verity to arrange a match with Graves. When being introduced to Graves, the villain asks whether they have met before, to which Bond responds by stating he would remember. Graves admits that he is mistaking. Driven by their arrogance, both men then engage in their training match, betting money on the outcome. When Graves asks Bond if he still wants to continue, Bond proposes to up the wager, showing him one of the blood diamonds he got from Zao.
When continuing their fight, Bond cuts Graves at the hand, pausing their fight to continue. When Bond mockingly-affably asks Graves whether he wants to continue, Graves responds that of course he wants to ""bloody continue"", but proposes that they use real swords and fight till first blood drawn from the torso. They engage in a furious duel, where both men are cut multiple times. Fighting their way through the club, changing their weapons multiple times. Eventually hammering at each others with medieval claymores, they continue their fight in the outer parts of the club, with Bond finally cutting Graves at the stomach, thereby throwing him into a fountain. Graves emerges furiously but before he can continue the fight, Miranda Frost stops them. Graves laughs and admits that Bond beat him and the men shake hands. Before they leave, Graves, as a token of good sportsmanship, invites Bond to his Icarus demonstration in Iceland at the next weekend.
When Bond arrives at Graves' Ice Palace at Iceland, a palace made from pure ice only built for the demonstration of Icarus, he is greeted by Graves and his security head Mr. Kil. While the guests entertain themselves inside, Graves is using his dream machine. He is interrupted by a man who is revealed to be Zao. Seeing his old friend for the first time after Zao's departure, Graves looks at his unfinished face and asks him who did that. Zao responds that it is Bond's work and Graves gleefully tells him that he has met Bond and Bond did not recognize him at all. Graves then asks Zao of news of his father and Zao tells him that General Moon still mourns his death.
The guests are then called for the presentation. Graves then presents Icarus, telling them that it will be used to bring light to the darkest places on earth and is able to warm even the coldest places to grow crops, therefor being a mean to end world hunger. He then uses Icarus to illuminate the entire palace, causing giant applause from the guests.
When NSA agent Jinx, who has also reached Island, breaks into the complex where Graves' chambers are located to kill Graves, she expects to find him under the dream machine's mask. However, when she takes the mask off, Zao looks at her and Graves attacks her from behind, wearing the prototype of his Icarus suit.
After saving Jinx from Zao, Bond heads to Graves' office where he waits for his old enemy. When Graves arrives, Bond tells him that he knows his true identity, based on Zao's presence and the lack of alternative explanations for the dream machine's presence. Graves mocks him, telling him he thought that Bond would never get it. He then reveals to Bond that while they only met briefly, Bond had made a lasting impression on him, causing him to model his new identity Gustav Graves after the MI6 agent. Miranda then arrives, holding her weapon at Graves. Graves remarks seemingly defeated that Miranda seems to be not the one she claims to be. Bond agrees, but then Graves asks whether he has found out who betrayed him in North Korea and if it never occurred to him to look inside MI6. Miranda then aims her gun at Bond, revealing herself as the traitor. Graves also reveals that he knows of Jinx and says that a tragedy will befall her soon.
When Bond is about to be killed, Bond goads Zao into hitting him into stomach in order to allow him to fall to the ground. Using a special ring he got from MI6's quartermaster, he breaks the glass panel that covers the entire floor in order to fall into the lower floor. As Bond runs off, Graves orders Zao to follow and kill him but Bond escapes with Graves' speeder, driving off into the ice plains at insane speed. When Zao returns and tells Graves that Bond escaped, Graves decides to unleash Icarus.
He orders Zao to bring the three North Korean generals (Dong, Li & Han) that were underneath the guests and tells them that he will demonstrate them the full power of Icarus. He then has Icarus produce a gargantuan heat beam, which Bond can only escape because of his vehicle's enormous speed. When Bond drives off a cliff, hanging there only on the breaking hook of the speeder, Graves has Icarus cut off the entire cliff. Though Bond survives, Graves believes him to be dead.
Preparing to return to North Korea, Graves leaves Zao at the palace to oversee the final preparations. He, Miranda and most of his men then leave the palace, leaving Zao only with a minimal force. Returning to the palace for Jinx, Bond sees their escape plane arrive. On the plane, Graves uses Icarus to destroy his ice palace, destroying any evidence left. After this, he tells his engineer Vlad to complete the Icarus suit.
Having fled to a North Korean airbase, Graves plans to use Icarus to destroy the minefield in the demilitarized zone, allowing North Korean forces to attack the South. As General Moon wouldn't allow this war, the hardliners staged a coup and put the general under arrest. Bond and Jinx are sent to stop Graves.When the USA sends a missile to destroy Icarus, Graves uses the satellite's power to disintegrate it mid-air.
Unable to assassinate Graves at the airbase, Jinx and Bond are forced to board Graves' plane. On-board the plane, Graves and the generals are inside a planning room, where Graves admires the finished Icarus suit. He tells his men to have his father brought down. When General Moon arrives, Graves addresses him, but as his face is changed General Moon does not recognize him. When Moon tells him that he does not now him, Graves says that Moon always found it difficult to accept him, which made his exile easier to bear. He then quotes his father, which makes Moon realises that the man next to him is his son. However, he is deeply shocked, asking what his son did to himself. Graves then tells his father to watch the rising of his son and activates Icarus to destroy the minefield. However, opposed to Graves, Moon is disgusted by the heat beam as he knows this would mean war, with the Americans presumably sending nuclear warheads.
Finally realizing what his son has become, Moon grabs a gun from General Han and points it at his son's head. Graves asks his father whether he would kill his own son. When Moon claims that his son died long ago, Graves disarms him with the electricity glove of his Icarus suit and shoots him. He then sees Bond walking towards him and about to shoot him, but a henchman intervenes and the bullet hits the plane's window instead, causing it to break, sucking out everyone except Bond and Graves.
Graves and Bond then fight in the remains of the room, with Graves eventually overpowers Bond with his shock glove, Graves takes the plane's two parachutes and throws one out of the window. Intending to leave Bond to die in the plane crash, Graves kneels down next to Bond for one last gloat.
As he leans over the fallen spy to gloat, 007 reaches out and yanks the parachute's release cord; causing Graves to be pulled through a hole in the fuselage. As Moon desperately clings onto the edge of the chassis, Bond reaches out and activates the suit's electric defenses causing Moon to shock himself. He loses his grip and is sucked - along with the controls for the Icarus - into the Autonov's jet engine. With the destruction of his suit, Icarus is rendered harmless.
Gustav Graves also appears in 007 Legends in the Die Another Day mission. He has the likeness of is and voiced by Toby Stephens, but no reference is made to his past as Colonel Moon, implying that he was born Gustav Graves. The only exception to this theory is that a bust of Colonel Moon's head can be seen on Graves's cargo plane. Although he is shown wearing his North Korean uniform underneath his armor, his collar cuffs are absent.
While an original character, the character of Gustav Graves incorporates a number of elements from Ian Fleming's original novel Moonraker. In that novel, a Nazi adopts a new identity and becomes a popular British multi-millionaire. He then donates millions to create a ""Moonraker"" missile which is supposed to be for Britain's protection but is actually meant to destroy London. In addition, the club called Blades, a fencing club in this film, was featured as a gentleman's club in Moonraker. The name Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is a homage to the first official James Bond novel written after Ian Fleming's death, Colonel Sun by Robert Markham (Kingsley Amis).

1507,/wiki/Hawkins_(Grand_L._Bush),"Hawkins is a fictional DEA operative and associate of Felix Leiter. He appears in the 1989 James Bond film Licence to Kill, portrayed by actor Grand L. Bush, and also appeared in John Gardner's accompanying novelization.
After Central American drug lord, Franz Sanchez, is spotted in the Bahamas, the DEA send Hawkins and his fellow operative Mullens to notify and collect Felix Leiter in Key West. After interrupting his wedding day by flagging down his car from a helicopter, Leiter and his best man, James Bond (ostensibly, as an ""observer""), travel to a airfield where Sanchez is attempting to make his escape. After Sanchez takes to the air in a stolen Beechcraft 18, the agents pursue him by helicopter and hook his aircraft in mid-flight, taking him into custody. He is present during the drug lord's subsequent interrogation and physically restrains his colleague Ed Killifer when he lunges for Sanchez.
Hawkins later attempts to phone Leiter at his home, but instead gets through to Bond, who has discovered that the recently escaped Sanchez has maimed Felix and murdered his wife Della. He phones for an ambulance and later visits Bond at the hospital, where he informs the spy that Sanchez has fled the U.S. and is now outside their jurisdiction. Bond suggests that there are 'other ways' to get to Sanchez, but the frustrated DEA agent promptly orders him to 'let it go'. Later, Hawkins intercepts Bond near the Ernest Hemingway Home and discusses 007's recent break-in to the warehouse where Leiter was maimed; including his killing of two armed guards and causing the death of the traitorous Killifer. He informs him that he is concerned with Bond's violation of U.S. law and can only cover for him so much; the police and District Attorney want to know what happened. Bond storms off, only to be confronted by two armed Secret Intelligence Service men, who usher him into the Hemingway House for an audience with M.

1509,/wiki/Gibson,"Gibson is a character in the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun. He was played by Gordon Everett.
Prior to the film's events, Gibson, a British solar energy expert, was employed by Thai multi-millionaire industrialist Hai Fat to develop a solution to the world's ongoing energy crisis. With the help of Fat's construction company, a highly efficient solar power-plant was constructed on an island belonging to the industrialist's junior partner, the assassin Francisco Scaramanga.
However, following its completion, Gibson attempts to return to Britain, bargaining for immunity with a critical component of the power-plant: the Solex Agitator unit. Having outlived his usefulness, Scaramanga is dispatched by Hai Fat to assassinate the scientist and recover the Solex. After meeting with his British contact at a Hong Kong strip club, Gibson is shot by Scaramanga, and the Agitator is stolen from the crime scene by the assassin's diminutive assistant, Nick Nack.

1511,/wiki/Brad_Whitaker,"Brad Whitaker was a fictional American arms dealer and one of the two main antagonists in the 1987 James Bond film The Living Daylights, alongside General Georgi Koskov. He was portrayed by American actor Joe Don Baker.
Brad Whitaker is an international black market arms dealer from the United States. He is fascinated by war - he always wears a US military uniform with the US insignia of General of the Army (5 stars General) - but his actual military career is a failure, so he turns to arms dealing to organize his own personal military force. Expelled from West Point for cheating, he spends a short stint as a mercenary in the Belgian Congo before working with various criminal organizations to help finance his first arms deals. He resides in Tangier, Morocco. He loves military history, and it is implied that he Wargames various historical conflicts using automated miniature figures and effects, such as the battles of Agincourt, Waterloo, and Gettysburg. In a conversation with James Bond, Whitaker believes that Pickett's Charge should have been made up Little Round Top, and that if Grant was in charge of the Union at Gettysburg, he would have crushed the Army of Northern Virginia, ending the war.
Whitaker even has a pantheon of ""great military commanders"" in his headquarters, which included some of history's most famous and infamous figures, such as Adolf Hitler, Napoleon I of France, Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, and Attila the Hun. Whitaker holds these men in high regard and calls them ""surgeons who removed society's dead flesh"". Perhaps the most disturbing thing about this collection is that all representations of these ""surgeons"" are sculpted to resemble Whitaker himself, which is highly noticeable when Whitaker hides among the statues waiting for General Pushkin to visit.
Whitaker hires the help of Soviet General Georgi Koskov to secure a large shipment of opium from the Snow Leopard Brotherhood in Afghanistan for $500,000,000 worth of diamonds that he had obtained from an arms deal with the Soviets. At the same time, they attempt to use James Bond to eliminate the Soviet head of secret operations, General Pushkin, on the basis that he has instituted an ongoing operation called ""Smert Shpionam"" meaning ""Death to Spies."" Actually, it is their men, especially Koskov's henchman Necros, who are involved in killing British secret service agents. After thwarting Whitaker's plans, Bond hunts him down at his Tangier headquarters and kills him after a game of cat-and-mouse in his gaming room, with him using high-tech weapons (such as a light machine gun with an integral ballistic shield), and Bond using his Walther PPK. After Bond hides behind a bust of British commander Wellington, he sets his key-ring finder behind it. Whitaker gets right in front of it, and the key-ring finder explodes, triggered by Bond's wolf whistle.

1514,/wiki/General_Pushkin_(John_Rhys-Davies),"General Leonid Pushkin (Russian: Леонид Пушкин) is a fictional Soviet general and the successor of Anatol Gogol. A major character portrayed by British actor, John Rhys-Davies, he only appeared in the 1987 James Bond film, The Living Daylights.
Soviet ""defector"", Georgi Koskov, informs MI6 that the KGB's old policy of Smert Spionam, meaning ""Death to Spies"", has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin, the new head of the KGB. Koskov is later abducted from the safe-house and assumed to have been taken back to Moscow. Bond is directed by M to track down Pushkin in Tangier, Morocco, and kill him in order to forestall further killings of agents and escalation of tensions between the Soviet Union and the West. Although James Bond's prior knowledge of Pushkin initially leads him to doubt Koskov's claims, he agrees to carry out the mission when he learns that the assassin who killed 004 (as depicted in the pre-title sequence) left a note bearing the same message, ""Smert Spionam.""
Meanwhile, Pushkin meets with arms dealer Brad Whitaker in Tangier, informing him that the KGB is cancelling an arms deal previously arranged between Koskov and Whitaker. Bond, arriving in Tangier, confronts Pushkin in his hotel suite as he got ready to spend time with his mistress, Rubavitch. The Russian General disavows any knowledge of ""Smert Spionam"", stating that the KGB deactivated Smert Spionam decades earlier and reveals that Koskov is evading arrest for embezzlement of government funds. Bond and Pushkin decide to let Koskov progress with his scheme by faking Pushkin's assassination; Bond ""kills"" Pushkin as he speaks to a trade convention in Tangier. Ironically, Bond saves Pushkin; Necros was about to kill Pushkin before Bond appeared and shot him first, which later revealed he wore a Kevlar vest and blood pack to fool Necros, Koskov and Whitaker into thinking he was killed.
Pushkin makes one final appearance after Bond later returns to Tangier to dispatch Whitaker. Following the arms dealer's demise, Pushkin arrives later and saves Bond by shooting Sergeant Stagg. Then, his men bring Koskov out, who is happy he is alive and tried to trick Pushkin into thinking Whitaker held him, but Pushkin arrests Koskov, sending him back to Moscow ""in a diplomatic bag"". After having Koskov taken away, Pushkin apparently helps Bond to clear his love interest Kara Milovy of any wrongdoing, as she had been Koskov's unknowing pawn and has her amnestied.
Originally, the KGB general set up by Koskov was to be General Gogol; however, actor Walter Gotell was too sick to handle the major role, and the character of Leonid Pushkin replaced Gogol, who appears briefly at the end of the film, having transferred to the Soviet diplomatic service. This was Gogol's final appearance in a James Bond film.
Similar to Milos Columbo in For Your Eyes Only, Bond was initially led to believe Pushkin was the enemy, only for him to ultimately be an ally against the real villain.
He was in the first draft of GoldenEye (1995). Just like in The Living Daylights, Pushkin was going to be used as a pawn in the main villain's scheme. His character was replaced with Dmitri Mishkin.

1515,/wiki/Brad_Whitaker%27s_Villa,"Whitaker's Villa is the fictional residence of arms dealer Brad Whitaker. It appears in the 1987 James Bond film The Living Daylights.
Brad Whitaker is an international black market arms dealer. From his villa in Tangiers, Whitaker conducts his illicit business with various governments and individuals. As would be expected, the villa's grounds are patrolled by armed guards.
On arrival, guests are led through a hallway containing a pantheon of ""great military commanders"", which includes some of history's most famous and infamous figures, such as Adolf Hitler, Napoleon Bonaparte, Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, and Attila the Hun. Whitaker holds these men in high regard and calls them ""surgeons who removed society's dead flesh"". All representations of these ""surgeons"" (or ""butchers"" as KGB Head, General Pushkin describes them) are sculpted to resemble Whitaker himself.
The villa also contains a further room devoted to military artifacts and a large case containing miniature soldier figurines with which, it is implied, he wargames various historical conflicts such as the battles of Agincourt, Waterloo, and Gettysburg. Contained within automated panels along the side of the case are various prototype weapons the arms dealer intends to sell to prospective clients.

1519,/wiki/Golgov_arms_cartel,"The Golgov arms cartel was a fictional arms smuggling ring founded by rogue Russian general, Golgov. Based in Central Russia, the cartel was active primarily in Morocco, Kurdistan and Central Russia. The organisation appeared in the 1998 James Bond video-game, James Bond 007, for the Nintendo Game Boy.
The Golgov arms cartel was an arms smuggling ring controlled by rogue Russian general, Golgov, and based in Central Russia. It was established for the purpose of destabilising volatile geopolitical regions and, ultimately, amassing an army to crush the West in retaliation for Russian nuclear disarmament. Operating in China, Morocco, and Kurdistan via their intermediary, Oddjob, the cartel supplied arms and equipment to both factions in the Kurdistani civil war. Among their assets, the organisation had access to nuclear weapons, tanks and high-tech powered exoskeletons; presumably inherited from ex-Soviet stockpiles. After Golgov's death at the hands of James Bond, the cartel's fate remains unknown; but it can be assumed to have dissolved.

1521,/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Dahum,"The Democratic Republic of Dahum, is a fictional West African country which appeared in William Boyd's 2013 James Bond novel Solo. It's political climate is wracked with a massive Civil War with Zanzarim that left its citizens starving by the tens of thousands. It's capital City is Port Dunbar.
What would one day become Dahum was originally part of the colonial country of Zanzarim. Zanzarim was an African nation that had been colonized by Germany before being overtaken and split in two by France and England in 1904. It eventually voted to become entirely an English colony until voting for independence in 1964. Zanzarim's main exports were cocoa beans, bananas, copper, and timber. Unfortunately, oil was discovered in the Zanza river delta in the South of the country. The Lowele tribe, the country's largest of their twenty-four or so tribes, dominated the government, but the oil was discovered squarely beneath the Fakassa tribe's ancestral lands, leading them to believe that it was solely theirs, while the Lowele government proclaimed that the proceeds from the oil should go to the entire country. In 1967 their stalemate was broken by an assessment of the oil reserves, which lead to both anti-Fakassa and anti-Lowele riots, which lead to general chaos and mass killings. England and the United Nations both tried to broker peace, but failed. As Fakassa tribesmen fled to the south, an official secession occurred, creating the Democratic Republic of Dahum. The Zanzari army invaded, but faced retaliation: starting the Civil War. Dahum was hopelessly outmanned and outgunned, but managed to stave off every attack on their shrunken borders due to the tactical genius of Solomon Adeka.
Unfortunately, the people of Dahum were essentially cut off from any supplies, and relied mainly on drops arranged by Hulbert Linck at the nearby Janjaville airstrip, but the people were still left starving. During the war, Port Dunbar was relatively untouched by the chaos of the war and life went on normally for the people in the city. After two years at war, Dahum was finally overtaken by Zanzarim.
The flag of Dahum is described as a rectangle horizontally bisected with white on top and black on bottom with a red disc in the white field. It is symbolic of a red sun casting a black shadow.

1522,/wiki/Everything_or_Nothing:_The_Untold_Story_of_007,"Released in 2012 and in time for the 50th anniversary of the Bond franchise by documentary maker Stevan Riley, Everything or Nothing: The Untold Story of 007 is a celebration of the 50 years of the James Bond films.
The documentary starts at the very beginning with the famous, and sometimes tepid, relationship between Ian Fleming and Hollywood, and it ends with today’s Bond, Daniel Craig. This talking-heads documentary successfully delves underneath what we already knew, giving us an insightful and informative look into the inner-workings of the Bond films that many of us grew up with.
Drawing inspiration from his intelligence work for the Royal Navy, author and journalist Ian Fleming first created James Bond as an alter ego of himself; Bond was whom Fleming wanted to be like. The antithesis of the modern man Bond’s fictional dealings within MI5 morphed him into a one-man army bent on serving his Queen and country.
The film’s linear narrative (going through each film chronologically) is helpful in keeping things simple for unfamiliar viewers. Candid interviews with everyone from Cubby Broccoli’s daughter Barbara (who produced Casino Royale) to Pierce Brosnan really encapsulates the influence that Bond has had for five decades.
For more Bond appreciation, the entire Bond collection was released on Blu-ray, in an epic collection aptly titled Bond 50. The set, which includes every Bond adventure in pristine condition and a set of behind-the-scenes extras that dive deeper into the series history, should feed any Bond junkie's appetite.

1523,/wiki/Cleek_MacSawney,"Shortly after Randolph Hellebore inherited the Hellebore estate on Loch Silverfin, he fired the previous gillie after he stood in his way when he tried to beat a horse. He then hired the bitter, spiteful, apelike alcoholic that was Cleek MacSawney. Over the next five years, he accompanied the Hellebores on hunts, and looked after the livestock and grounds. He kicked the dogs so often that they would shrink away when he came near. One night, MacSawney went out to the pigpen to get a new test subject for Hellebore's experiments. The pigs were resistant to his taking one of the piglets, and so he kicked their mother in the head, making her back off. However, he kicked one of the piglets clear across the pen and killed it. He resolved to take it away to eat. James Bond was found that night sneaking into the castle. He was taken to the laboratory, and attempted to escape. MacSawney stood in his way, and suffered a kick to the testes for it. When the boy had been injected, Cleek dragged him to a holding cell, and swore he would pay for what he'd done.
However, when Randolph's son George Hellebore, and James Bond entered the laboratory, and began to destroy it. MacSawney entered with a shotgun, prepared to shoot the boys. He narrowly missed, and shattered an eel tank. The boys escaped and released some of the deranged SilverFin test pigs on him, which he promptly shot. More pigs came, and he tried to keep them back, but was eventually killed by the swine he had abused with a sickening crunch. As James escaped, he believed he saw that MacSawney's body was missing its lower half.

1529,/wiki/Die_Another_Day_(soundtrack),"La La Land RecordsThe soundtrack was composed by David Arnold; this is his third time composing for a James Bond movie. The soundtrack was released on Warner Brothers Records, which is also Madonna's label.
Although the Bond films have a longstanding connection with the pop music world, the choice of Madonna's song, coupled with the use of The Clash's London Calling, proved wildly controversial with some fans who felt the two pieces of music were inappropriate for a Bond movie. ""London Calling"" was used briefly in the film as Bond returns to England via British Airways; at the time, the airline was using the song in American radio and television commercials.
The title song for Die Another Day was written and sung by Madonna. Madonna also had a small cameo in the movie as Verity, a leather-clad fencing instructor.
Madonna's theme song was unusual in that it was presented in a credit sequence that actually moved the film's plot along (as opposed to all previous Bond film titles which are standalone set pieces - an exception being the third segment of the Dr. No titles). The concept of the song/title sequence was that it represented Bond trying to keep his sanity during 18 months of torture at the hands of the North Koreans. The divided opinion over the ""Die Another Day"" theme is evidenced in that it was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song as well as for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song (2002).It peaked at number eight in the United States and remained as her last top 10 hit until ""Hung Up"" (2005).

1530,/wiki/Fleming,"Ian Lancaster Fleming (28 May 1908 – 12 August 1964) was an author, journalist and Commander in the Royal Navy, most famous for creating the James Bond series.
Ian Lancaster Fleming (28 May 1908 – 12 August 1964) was an English author, journalist and naval intelligence officer, best known for his James Bond series. Fleming came from a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co., and his father was the Member of Parliament for Henley from 1910 until his death on the Western Front  in 1917. Educated at Eton, Sandhurst and the universities of Munich and Geneva, Fleming moved through a number of jobs before he started writing.
While working for Britain's Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War, Fleming was involved in planning Operation Goldeneye and in the planning and oversight of two intelligence units, 30 Assault Unit and T-force. His wartime service and his career as a journalist provided much of the background, detail and depth of the James Bond novels.
Fleming wrote his first Bond novel, Casino Royale, in 1952. It was a success, with three print runs being commissioned to cope with the demand. Eleven Bond novels and two short-story collections followed between 1953 and 1966. The novels revolved around James Bond, an officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a commander in the Royal Naval Reserve. The Bond stories rank among the best selling series of fictional books of all time, having sold over 100 million copies worldwide. Fleming also wrote the children's story Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and two works of non-fiction. In 2008, The Times ranked Fleming fourteenth on its list of ""The 50 greatest British writers since 1945"".

Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker who suffered from heart disease; he died in 1964, aged 56, from a heart attack. His novel The Man with the Golden Gun and short story collection Octopussy and The Living Daylights were released posthumously and he only saw two of his Bond novels turned into films: Dr. No and From Russia with Love. Other authors have since produced Bond novels.
Fleming was born in Mayfair, London W1 of parents Valentine and Evelyn st. Criox Rose. He had an elder brother Richard and a half sister Amaryllis. Fleming Married Anne Geraldin Mary Charteris in 1952. They had a son Caspar Robert Fleming.

He left Sandhurst early and improved his languages at Kitzbühel, Austria, studying German mainly. In preparation for his Foreign office exams he also went to Munich University, and the University of Geneva where he Improved his French.

They used the gathered intelligence to direct the commandos to targets predetermined in early campaigns. This included raids on enemy headquarters for intelligence. 30 Commando were seconded to other forces as opposed to independent activities. Later, due to it reliable information and efficiency it was given direct tasks under Fleming's control. He later had to make a case for the misuse of the Commandos for being the main force as opposed to intelligence gathering which was becoming less of a priority and would cause a loss of reporting which would have made other units less effective.
In 1944 Fleming became a member of Boodle's gentleman's club in St. James's Street, until his death in 1964.

1534,/wiki/Hammerhead,"Hammerhead was the third Dynamite James Bond comic arc. It was written by British author Andy Diggle and illustrated by Italian comic book artist, Luca Casalanguida. Published by Dynamite Entertainment, the story was released in six issues between 12th October 2016 and 29th March 2017.
After returning from Venezuela to learn that Hunt Engineering, Britain's leading arms manufacturer, was targeted by a mysterious figure going by the codename of 'Kraken', a radical anti-capitalist, whose underlings he was sent to kill, James Bond is assigned on behalf of the British Intelligence to attend the Dubai Arms Fair and make contact with Hunt Engineering where they will be showcasing their newly developed weapons, for which M is under the impression that Kraken will be making another attempt on the firm. Bond meets Victoria Hunt, the daughter of Lord Hunt, the company's owner, who gives him a tour of all the products they have manufactured, including a technically advanced firearm rounds called APHEX and a massively large sized, heavily modified and overdeveloped railgun given the name of 'Hammerhead'.
Bond is invited to a gala held by Lord Bernard Hunt, whom he briefly meets before a sudden hostile attack ensues by masked gunmen in heavy combat armors. Lord Hunt is killed in the process with a headshot by a bullet which 007 identifies as an APHEX round, an off-the-market product manufactured by Hunt Engineering, suspecting the existence of a manipulative insider within the company. Bond manages to kill the assailants and protects Victoria in the process. After identifying the group of attackers, Bond tracks their source down to Al Hajjarah in Yemen and heads over there, escorted by Victoria in her personal jet, in which both have a romantic encounter. Meanwhile, at the Outer Hebrides, a Royal Navy helicopter transporting decommissioned Hunt warheads was shut down and its containment disappeared. Upon learning the news, Bond classifies the attack as a scheme planned and executed by Kraken.
Arriving at the Yemeni airport, Bond acquires a facilitated MI-6 vehicle by the Q-Branch, a gadget-laden Ford Mustang sports car, and drives to the location he tracked the source of the late gunmen down, kills the remaining members of the team, only to find out that their current involvement in the case was to deliver the smuggled goods to Karim Malfakhar. He contacts Bill Tanner to inform him of the grasp he has on the case, who tells him in return that Kraken isn't targeting the warheads but stealing them. Suddenly, Bond's car eliminates the connection with Tanner and enables the auto-pilot mode on its own, making several attempts to kill him. Bond, however, manages to manipulate the car into taking a leap over the edge of a cliff which falls into its own destruction. Among the remains of the vehicle, Bond finds the computer software microchip inserted into the source and identifies it as a product of Hunt Engineering, knowing that Kraken has been keeping an eye on him. Soon thereafter, in the middle of the Yemeni desert, Bond is captured and tranquilized by a group of mobsters led by a man who introduces himself as Malfakhar, the aforementioned smuggler.
Untrusting of his employer, Malfakhar tells Bond he had orders to smuggle a nuclear bomb, unrelated to that of the incident at the Hebrides, and eliminate the British agent. But, his orders from Kraken to wait for further instructions made him suspicious, hence 007 proposes an allegiance with him by revealing to him that the actual nuclear containment is missing, with the casing sent Malfakhar's way for distraction. Using the microchip to extract information from, Bond and Malfakhar track down the nuclear containment into a warhead in custody of The Bodicea, a militarized ship registered to Hunt Engineering, who are preparing to use Hammerhead to fire it at an undisclosed location on Kraken's orders. Bond, Malfakhar and his men engage in a firefight with the ship's crew and take over control of it, preventing Hammerhead from launching the warhead. And in the meantime, Bond comes to deduce the true identity of Kraken.
At the Outer Hebrides, in a nuclear reprocessing facility known as Black Crannog, M and Moneypenny meet the Defence Minister and Victoria Hunt for an official meeting discussion over the matters of public inquiry regarding Kraken's attacks. But, eventually, as Moneypenny is alerted of an attack on the facility, Victoria reveals herself as Kraken and captures them all as her hostages, killing the Defence Minister in the process. She explains her schemes being about restoring the British Empire to its former glory and wipe out the entirety of London and dismantling the current government with the hope of rebuilding it all anew by her own administration.
Bond is extracted by Malfakhar at an undisclosed coordination in the middle of the Outer Hebrides and lands on HMS Vengeance, a Royal Navy ballistic missile submarine, and circulates Black Crannog with a stable plan along with the crew as well as the additional assistance from other Royal Navy battleships to unleash an attack on the base and eliminate Victoria Hunt. As they are to deploy an underwater team for the planned assault, HMS Vengeance is taken over remotely by Victoria's Kraken system and fires a nuclear missile away, giving the team (including 007) thirty minutes to stop the missile before it hits London. However, as they approach the Black Crannog, the entirety of the team was eliminated with the Hammerhead railgun, just in time Bond takes a leap into the sea for his life and survives. Believed dead, Bond sneaks into the base and takes over the Hammerhead, killing whoever comes in his way. Knowing Victoria installed backdoor systems to keep track of her own active artillery with microchips, Bond uses the microchip he acquired from his Mustang earlier to get a lock on the fired warhead and destroys it. He also uses the Hammerhead to kill Victoria for good in her own quarters. Bond finds and rescues M and Moneypenny and all the three escape in a MI-6 helicopter just as the facility is destructed in the blast.

On FDR Drive, the assassin known as Whisper driving a white Corvorado fires a metal dart from the wing mirror into Charlie's temple, killing him. This causes Charlie's foot to stomp on the accelerator trapping Bond in the speeding car. Bond manages to get the car to stop by swerving it into a nearby car. Later as the police examine his body, Bond, using one of the officers' phones, informs Felix Leiter of Charlie's death.

1536,/wiki/Disco_Volante,"In the movie adaptation of Thunderball, the ship is destroyed during a pitched battle between Largo and Bond. With no one at the helm and the steering jammed, the ship ran aground at full speed and burst into flames.
The Disco Volante consisted really of two vessels, a front hydrofoil and a rear attached ""cocoon"", this enabled the hydrofoil to be detached and move independently at high speed. It included an underwater hatch for loading the bombs and giving access for divers.
Aside from its underwater hatch, the vessel's cinematic counterpart came equipped with numerous pieces of equipment which were not included in the novel Thunderball, including:
The real craft used in the film was a hydrofoil ferry, The Flying Fish, built by Rodriquez Cantieri Navali, who had built the first successful one at Freccia del Sole. The ""cocoon"" was built on set. It was purchased for the film for $500,000 and brought from Puerto Rico to Miami for refitting and refurbishment. The hydrofoil never sailed again after the filming. It was rented as a stationary houseboat, docked at a marina on Miami's MacArthur Causeway, until it sank at the dock in the early 1980s.

London-based journalist Dolly Hamnet travelled to Corsica investigating a secretive Vampire Cult. On her last day on the island she attended a party at a fashionable resort, attempting to make contact with its members, and was trailed back to her hotel in Ajaccio. She was also shadowed by James Bond, who had also been investigating the cult - who had already claimed three lives. The astute and resourceful Hamnet immediately saw through Bond's cover identity, familiar with his previous operations, and acquiesced to his request to protect her. The pair were jumped by one of the cult's members, who tranquilized 007 and bit the reporter with poisonous false fangs. Her corpse (and the recently awoken 007) was discovered the following morning by a terrified bellhop.

1539,/wiki/CMDR_Carter,"Commander Carter is the fictional captain of the USS Wayne, an American nuclear submarine. A major character, he appears in the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, portrayed by actor Shane Rimmer and also appears in Christopher Wood's accompanying novelization.
Carter first appears when James Bond and Anya Amasova are transported by helicopter to the USS Wayne in the ocean to continue research on Liparus. When the two battleships are on the surface on the high seas, the huge tanker ""swallows"" the submarine as he had done before with the British HMS Ranger. Bond, Anya, Carter and the entire crew are rendered by men of Karl Stromberg and put together the commander Talbot and his British crew captured early in the film.
Bond and Carter can however take command of the ship after intense struggle among navy men and henchmen of the lunatic villain and the captain uses the tracking system USS Wayne to change the trajectories of nuclares missiles launched by Stromberg and make them destroy submarines villains themselves. Carter then ordered to immediately destroy Atlantis, the great submarine platform that is home to Stromberg and where he fled, and gives Bond an hour to try to save Anya who is imprisoned in it. After this time, even without Bond to news, he fires the torpedoes that destroy and sink the platform but the two spies had managed to escape shortly before.

Shane Rimmer also portrayed a radio operator in You Only Live Twice and Tom in Diamonds Are Forever.

1540,/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_MP5,"First seen in the unofficial 1983 James Bond film Never Say Never Again, 
variants of the firearm have seen widespread usage in the official James Bond franchise from 1987's The Living Daylights onward. In addition, semi-fictional firearms modeled on the MP5, renamed and lacking identifying trademarks, appeared in many James Bond video games.
The Heckler & Koch MP5 is first seen in the unofficial 1983 James Bond film Never Say Never Again. While attempting to move a stolen atomic bomb through the cavernous Tears of Allah, below a desert oasis on the Ethiopian Coast, Maximillian Largo's men carry old spec MP5 submachine guns with the original straight magazines.
First officially introduced in The Living Daylights' (1987) pre-credits sequence, the SAS unit training with MI6 at Gibraltar uses Heckler & Koch MP5A3 submachine guns loaded with paintballs. Several years later, in Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), many of Elliot Carver's henchmen, including Stamper carry MP5 variants; including the MP5A3, MP5K, and MP5K-PDW. Notably, in the final gunfight on-board Carver's Stealth Ship, Wai Lin dual-wields a pair of MP5A3 and Bond uses an MP5K-PDW along with his Walther P99. For The World is Not Enough (1999), the villain Renard uses an MP5K while fleeing the nuclear test site. One is also used by Valentin Zukovsky when he and his men attack Maiden's Tower near the climax. In Die Another Day (2002), many of the guards at Gustav Graves' ice palace can be seen carrying MP5Ks with suppressors attached. During the training simulation, several terrorists can be seen carrying MP5SDs. In Quantum of Solace (2008), General Medrano's men carry MP5K-PDWs during the Haiti boat chase sequence. CIA officers attempting to apprehend Bond in Bolivia are also seen using suppressed versions of both the MP5K and MP5A3.
It is also used in GoldenEye 007 (1997) as the D5K Deutsche and D5K Silenced.
In Agent Under Fire (2001), called the ""Koffler & Stock KS7"", the Heckler & Koch MP5A1 is used in the ""Trouble in Paradise"" and ""Cold Reception"" Levels. The guards in the ""Bad Diplomacy"" level use this weapon as well. The version used in the game has a buttcap instead of a stock, making it the elusive MP5A1. The MP5 in the game is shown as being inaccurate (while the real life one refutes this as it is one of the most accurate submachine guns in the world) and it makes a strange laser sound when firing.
In Nightfire (2002) the MP5K appears in the game as the ""Deutsche M9K"", and has a 21-round magazine (despite the real MP5K having only 15 or 30-round box magazines) and a removable silencer.
The MP5K is one of the submachine guns that are used in Everything or Nothing (2004). It has a small magazine but is quite strong. It can stop a person with one shot, and bring him down with the next.
The Heckler & Koch MP5A2 appears as the ""SAF 9mm"" in Quantum of Solace (2008). It comes with tri-rail handguards and a forward pistol grip. The gun can also be modified with an ARO red-dot scope and a suppressor, and a gold-plated version is available for use in multiplayer. This gun appears in the levels Siena, Miami, Airport, and Casino Royale, appearing variously with a fixed stock or without a stock at all.
The ""Sigmus 9"" in GoldenEye 007 (2010) is a proper Heckler & Koch MP5-N, since it has a fixed stock and a Navy 3-position trigger group. In Reloaded Bond performs a normal HK slap reload with the weapon rather than racking the charging handle. As in the Wii version, capacity is 30 rounds. The ""Sigmus"" in Reloaded is a MP5KN, equipped with a 20-round magazine; even if Bond is also carrying an MP5, it is impossible to use the compatible 30-round magazines in this weapon. The model has all three fire mode settings white, and the selector is set to semi-auto even though the gun fires in fully automatic mode.
The H&K MP5A2 made a final video-game appearance in 007 Legends (2012), once again as the ""Sigmus 9"".

A minor character, he appeared in the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall, portrayed by Serbian actor Milorad Kapor.
The Boat Captain is first seen in his boat in Shanghai awaiting for Silva's mistress Sévérine following the death of Patrice at the hands of MI6 agent James Bond. However, Silva soon learns that Sévérine has defected herself to Bond for her safety.
To that end, Silva gets the Captain and his crew to hold both Bond and Sévérine hostage and deliver them to his island near Nagasaki Harbor. During the meeting between Bond and Silva, the Captain is seen at the background, acting as a guard. He later helps the rest of Silva's men in preparing a classic game by using Sévérine as a target with a glass of alcohol on her head. On Silva's orders, the Captain holds Bond at gunpoint to make him shoot down the glass if he can. After Bond fails, Silva kills Sévérine, but this resulted in an angry Bond smacking the Captain's arm before shooting down the rest of Silva's men with the Captain's gun. He also pulls the Captain's leg. Eventually, one of the henchmen tries to shoot down Bond with his rifle, but Bond spins the captain into the path of the bullets. As such, the Captain is accidentally shot to his death by the thug, who would later end up shot to death by Bond while Silva is arrested by MI6.
Bond would later find out that Silva was planning to get himself arrested as part of his true plan to discredit MI6 and kill M for betraying him to the Chinese (which became a complete success), and that the Captain was nothing more than a pawn alongside Silva and the rest of Silva's thugs as part of Ernst Stavro Blofeld's true plot of wreaking psychological pain on Bond.

On-board Drax's Space Station, James Bond and Dr. Holly Goodhead manage to disable the station's radar jamming system; leading to the unauthorized space structure becoming visible to both the Americans and Soviets for the first time. The United States dispatches a platoon of Marines in a space shuttle, which blasts off from Vandenberg Air Force Base. Colonel Scott was the commanding officer of the group and leads his men in their attempt to storm the station. Captain Waite controls the space craft. After a sustained firefight with Drax's armed forces around and inside the station, it begins to lose structural stability and violently falls apart. Their mission accomplished, the Marines retreat back to the relative safety of the shuttle and depart.

1548,/wiki/Blofeld%27s_Yacht,"The Delos (her name in 1963), built as Wappen von Hamburg, today named Aurora, was the first German ship after World War II. She was built by the famous Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, used by the HADAD line to connect the German islands with the mainland.
In late 1961, she was sold to Greece for £ 375.000, and renamed to 'Delos'. Under this name, she was used for filming 'From Russia with Love'.
The ship was sold again in 1967, this time it went to Canada, was renamed 'Polar Star' and was used for trips to polar regions.
After several renamings in the United States, it was last renamed in 2009, changing its name from 'Faithful' to 'Aurora'. Currently, she is under restoration in California.
In the movie, this ship serves as the headquarters of Ernst Stavro Blofeld. He summons Rosa Klebb and Kronsteen there twice in the movie.

1550,/wiki/George_Lazenby,"George Lazenby was born in Goulburn, New South Wales, Australia, and served in the Australian Army Special forces and as a military unarmed combat instructor.
He moved to London in 1964; working as a car salesman and as a model, then as an actor in advertising, by 1968, he was the highest-paid model in the world (it is said that in 1967, he made £40,000 directly from modelling, and £60,000 from commercials and product endorsements—equivalent to more than a million pounds in 2004); he also was the European Marlboro Man.
In the 1970s he worked in Hong Kong with Bruce Lee; a luncheon meeting with Lee and Raymond Chow to discuss a movie project collapsed with Lee's sudden death. Despite having starred in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) and The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977), the combined gross earnings of which exceeded $100 million worldwide in the 1970s (then the standard establishing an actor as a box office success), Lazenby's career never flourished. He then focused on business and real estate investments and ended up owning mansions in Hawaii, Brentwood, California, Australia, and a 600-acre (2.4 km²) ranch estate in Valyermo, California, a small town about 17 miles southeast of Palmdale, California; he also owns a portside penthouse apartment in Hong Kong, and an estate home in Maryland.
In 2002 he married his second wife, former tennis player Pam Shriver (member of the Kennedy family and fourth cousin of Maria Shriver, wife of California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger). They have three children, George, born on 12 July 2004, and twins Caitlin Elizabeth and Samuel Robert, born in October 2005. He also has an adult daughter named Melanie from his first marriage to Christina ""Chrissie"" Gannett Lazenby. Lazenby also had a son with his first wife Gannett, named Zack, who died in 1994 of brain cancer. Lazenby's first wife, Christina Gannett, is heiress to the Gannett News Service publishing empire.
Today, Lazenby enjoys sailing, motorcycle racing, car racing, reading, watching movies and playing golf, and tennis.
George Lazenby's first serious acting role was as James Bond in the film On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). Lazenby is the second official actor to portray the British secret agent. It was rumoured that Lazenby had been ""difficult to work with"" in this project. According to Lazenby, however, the difficulties were caused by director Peter R. Hunt, who apparently refused to talk directly to him—and this in turn was caused by Lazenby (unaware of studio politics or Hunt's sensibilities) passing on a request for Hunt's friends to clear a set before filming. During the film's production, Lazenby's manager, Ronan O'Rahilly, talked him into refusing a seven-movie contract on the grounds that the Bond character was out of touch with the times. Unsurprisingly, Lazenby describes this as the biggest mistake of his life.
Reception of Lazenby's performance often varies greatly, as some view him to be the quintessential James Bond while some view him as the worst of the actors to play 007. Likewise, feelings about the film usually vary greatly as well. From a commercial perspective On Her Majesty's Secret Service paled in comparison to the previous Bond film You Only Live Twice and the later Diamonds Are Forever (both featuring Connery as Bond); this has been partly attributed to a poor publicity campaign.
Critical response to On Her Majesty's Secret Service remains sharply divided. Many fans, perhaps especially fans of Fleming's original novels, regard it as one of the best Bond films. Other critics name it as one of the lesser Bond films. Nevertheless it is widely considered one of the best and most faithful adaptations of Ian Fleming's original novels.
Lazenby has portrayed Bond several times over the years in numerous parodies and unofficial 007 roles, most notably the 1983 TV movie The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E. and an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, titled ""Diamonds Aren't Forever"".

1561,/wiki/Cigar_Girl,"Giulietta da Vinci (listed in the film credits as Cigar Girl) was a fictional assassin under the employ of the terrorist, Renard. She appeared in the 1999 James Bond film, The World Is Not Enough, and its accompanying novelization penned by Raymond Benson. The character was portrayed by Italian actress, Maria Grazia Cucinotta, and was doubled by stuntwoman Sarah Donohue.
Bond overpowers Lachaise's bodyguards and holds him at gunpoint. Just as Bond is about to get the name of an assassin, Lachaise is killed by a thrown knife in his neck by an escaping Giulietta. Bond and the Cigar Girl both escape from the building.

In a deleted scene of the film, we find that Giulietta is actually working for Renard, and she reveals that Bond on the case. Renard gives her the task of taking him out, and says that he trusts she won't let him down. She was also told to allow Bond to escape the original attack in Spain, so that the bomb would be delivered to MI6 headquarters. Bond returns to MI6 headquarters in London, England in order to return the money to Sir Robert King. However, the money was actually a fertilizer bomb which kills King and blows a hole in the wall of the building. Through a hole in the wall, 007 spots Giulietta, who is watching the building from a Sunseeker boat on the River Thames. The assassin is wearing a red leather body suit with a zipper down the front. She uses a machine gun to fire at Bond and then takes off down the Thames, with Bond pursuing in a prototype Q-boat.
An elaborate chase takes place along the Thames, and it ends at the Millennium Dome. Giulietta uses a grenade launcher as well. Just as two torpedoes are about to blow up her boat, she beaches her boat near the Millennium Dome, and jumps onto a hot air balloon basket. Bond follows closely by, and jumps to catch the mooring ropes to the balloon. Bond offers her protection from her real boss, but she refuses, asserting that Bond cannot protect her from ""him"". Giulietta then commits suicide by shooting the aircraft's gas tank, causing the balloon to explode in a huge fireball. Bond releases from the rope and falls onto the roof of the Millennium Dome, hurting his shoulder on the landing. This injury hampers him throughout the rest of the film. We later learn in the film that she was working for Renard or his full name, Victor Zokas. Giulietta was hired to keep an eye on Mr. Lachaise.
In the novel adaptation of The World Is Not Enough, then-current Bond novelist Raymond Benson gave the Cigar Girl a name: Giulietta da Vinci, and retained a scene between her and Renard in Bilbao that was cut from the theatrical release.

1569,/wiki/Bond_girl_curse,"The term Bond girl curse was coined after media supposition that actresses starring as Bond girls in James Bond movies would later damage their acting career as a result.
The term has usually been applied only to relatively unknown actresses. A small amount of Bond girls have been portrayed by already established actresses such as Honor Blackman, Diana Rigg, Teri Hatcher, Monica Bellucci and Ana de Armas.
The production of both Die Another Day and Casino Royale were stalled after encountering difficulty finding willing actresses to accept roles as a result of the supposed ""curse"". Eva Green had to be persuaded by her agent to take the role of Vesper Lynd, which she eventually did with some diffidence.
In more recent times the pattern seems to have halted, even reversed. Since 2002 a majority of Bond girl actresses have either continued their careers successfully, or shot to even greater success after starring in a Bond film. Two Bond girls (Kim Basinger and Halle Berry) would later win Oscars.

The story is set a few years after the events of Quantum of Solace. It starts with Greco, an international terrorist planning a suicide attack on the G-20 Summit at the Acropolis structure in Athens. M sends James Bond to investigate and prevent an attack from occurring. After a brief encounter with Greco on his yacht, Bond pursues him through Athens by boat and then on foot. After a second confrontation with Greco which ends with Greco left alive, Bond stops a bomb-laden car destined for the Acropolis structure by knocking it off the road with an Aston Martin DBS V12 he had commandeered, saving the G-20 summit from potential disaster. Greco's fate is left unclear; leaving him potentially the only villain who escapes or ends up in the hands of the authorities.
In the Nintendo DS version of Blood Stone, Greco is able to outrun Bond and get into a truck loaded with explosives, intending to drive it into the Acropolis to carry out the suicide attack personally.  With no transportation immediately available to pursue Greco's truck, Bond then takes a rocket launcher from a nearby goon and uses it to destroy the truck before it reaches its intended target, killing Greco.

1574,/wiki/Carte_Blanche,"Carte Blanche is a James Bond novel written by Jeffery Deaver. Commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications, it was published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton on 26 May 2011 and was released in the United States by Simon & Schuster on 14 June 2011. Carte Blanche is the thirty-seventh original James Bond novel and the first to have a contemporary setting since The Man with the Red Tattoo by Raymond Benson was published in 2002; as such, it does not share continuity with its predecessor, Devil May Care, which was set within the timeframe of Ian Fleming's original novels.
The title and cover artwork were unveiled on January 17, 2011, at a special launch event at the InterContinental Hotel in Dubai.
Carte Blanche updates James Bond's backstory to fit with the 21st century setting, making it the first ever true reboot of the literary James Bond series, to the extent of reimagining several major characters from the franchise (the John Gardner novels, though they were updated for the 1980s, avoided the issue of fully rebooting the Bond character). Jeffery Deaver has stated that his James Bond will have been born in 1979, making him a veteran of the war in Afghanistan (Operation Herrick), instead of a World War II veteran and Cold War secret agent as originally conceived by creator Ian Fleming. Among the changes, Q is from India, while Moneypenny is directly described as resembling the actress Kate Winslet.
Set in mid-2011, the story takes place over the course of a week. James Bond is a former Royal Naval Reserve officer who has recently joined the Overseas Development Group - a covert operational unit of British security under the control of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office tasked ""to identify and eliminate threats to the country by extraordinary means."" Bond is an agent with the 00 Section of O (Operations) Branch of the ODG.
He starts his assignment on the outskirts of Novi Sad in Serbia where an Irish sapper-turned-enforcer named Niall Dunne is planning to derail a train carrying three hundred kilograms of methyl isocyanate, dumping it into the Danube. Bond is able to prevent the catastrophe by derailing the train himself at a much safer place along the line. He is unable to detain Dunne, who kills Bond's Serbian contacts in the course of his escape.
Using what little intelligence Bond was able to gather from the operation in Serbia, the ODG is able to establish a connection to Green Way International, a waste disposal consortium contracted to demolish an army base in March. Because Bond is not authorized to act on British soil, he is forced to work with a domestic security agent named Percy Osborne-Smith. The two men clash over the interpretation of the intelligence, prompting Bond to manipulate Osborne-Smith into pursuing a lead Bond knows to be false, and allowing him to investigate the March army base on his own. While exploring the base hospital, he is sealed inside by Niall Dunne, who intends to kill him by bringing the hospital down in a controlled demolition. Bond escapes by improvising an explosive device.
Bond turns his attention to Green Way International, led by the enigmatic Severan Hydt. The Dutch-born Hydt is a ""rag-and-bone man"", who made his fortune in the disposal of waste. He has an intense fascination with death, which is strongly implied to be a sexual fetish. The Overseas Development Group authorize Bond to investigate Hydt when intelligence surfaces suggesting he is also known as 'Noah' and a key player in the derailment in Serbia, which is believed to be a prelude to a much bigger attack that will affect British interests. Bond gets wind of a second attack, to occur later in the week, killing up to one hundred people. He tracks Hydt to Dubai and with the help of CIA officer Felix Leiter, eavesdrops on a conversation with one of Hydt's senior researchers.
Concerned that the attack is imminent, Bond attempts to anticipate Hydt's next move and is on the verge of evacuating a crowded museum when he realizes that Hydt is there for an exhibit of the bodies of ninety tribal nomads who were killed a millennium ago. Aborting his planned evacuation, Bond returns to Hydt's facility to find that Leiter has been attacked by an unknown assailant and a local CIA asset has been murdered.
Hydt leaves Dubai for Cape Town, with Bond following closely. Once inside South Africa, he meets Bheka Jordaan, a local police operative. Bond is able to get close to Hydt by posing as a Durban-based mercenary, and fuels Hydt's fixation with death by promising him access to mass graves across the African continent. Hydt is taken by Bond's proposal of exhuming the bodies and recycling them into consumer products such as building materials, and gradually welcomes him into his inner circle. Bond attends a fundraiser for the International Organisation Against Hunger with Hydt, where he meets Felicity Willing, the charity's spokesperson. After helping Willing deliver the left-over food from the fundraiser to a distribution centre the two begin a relationship.
Using his cover, Bond is able to infiltrate Hydt's operations in South Africa. His relationship with Bheka Jordaan sours, particularly when he encounters the assailant who attacked Felix Leiter in Dubai: the brother of one of his contacts who was killed in Serbia. As the deadline for the attack - known as Gehenna (derived from the Hebrew word for Hell) - approaches, the Overseas Development Group is ordered to pull Bond out of South Africa and send him to Afghanistan as Whitehall believes the attack will happen there as they can see no connection between Hydt and Gehenna. M is not convinced and manages to keep Bond in South Africa, but the future of the agency depends on his being correct in suspecting Hydt.
On the day of the Gehenna attacks, Bond deduces that the target is somewhere in York, but his report is ignored by Osborne-Smith, who believes it is aimed at a security conference in London. Bond manages to access Hydt's research and development facility, where he uncovers plans for a weapon developed by Serbia known as ""the Cutter"", which fires razor-sharp shards of titanium at hypervelocity. Hydt has been using his operations to steal sensitive information, from which he has acquired the blueprints to the Cutter. Bond realized that the derailment in Serbia was a false flag operation: its intention was not to drop methyl isocyanate into the Danube, but to allow Niall Dunne the opportunity to steal scrap metal from the train for use in the prototype Cutter. Hydt was employed by an American pharmaceutical corporation to detonate a Cutter at a university in York, killing a cancer researcher on the verge of a breakthrough that would bankrupt the pharmaceutical corporation. Misinformation fed to a Hungarian newspaper would suggest the attack was aimed at a fellow lecturer who was a vocal opponent of the Serbian government. With the help of Hydt's personal assistant, Bond is able to stop the attack. Hydt is arrested, but Dunne escapes and shoots his employer at long range.
Bond is uncomfortable with the conclusion, feeling that there are too many loose ends at hand. Research shows that the ODG had been misled, and their intelligence misinterpreted; Severan Hydt was never known as Noah. Rather, it is an acronym for the National Organisation Against Hunger, which recently expanded to provide food aid on an international scale. Niall Dunne is an associate of Felicity Willing, whose organisation has expanded to the point where she directly controls one-third of all food aid arriving in Africa. She intends to use this power to strategically distribute food throughout east Africa, giving the Sudanese government a pretext to go to war with rebels and prevent Southern Sudan from seceding. Bond lures Willing into a trap at an abandoned inn where she confesses the plot. Niall Dunne re-appears, attacking the party before Bond and Bheka Jordaan shoot and kill him. Willing is taken to a black site after MI6 spread stories suggesting she was embezzling from her own charity.
A subplot throughout the novel involves Bond's investigations into a KGB operation code-named ""Steel Cartridge"". Bond believes that his father was a spy for the United Kingdom during the Cold War, and that he was killed by Russian agents. Further evidence suggests that Steel Cartridge was a clean-up operation, with the Russians assassinating their own agents that had infiltrated Western intelligence organisations. The suggestion that his father was a traitor does not sit well with Bond, until he unearths further evidence that shows the Russians carried out a Steel Cartridge assassination on a Western spy-hunter who was dangerously close to identifying Soviet moles - his mother, Monique Delacroix Bond.
Carte Blanche features several recurring characters from the Fleming novels, however, they all have updated backstories in order to fit in with the contemporary setting:
"

Gregor Karakov is a Russian politician, owner of several mines of Siberia but also a member of Quantum's executive board. He was one of several peoples attending a meeting during a performance of Tosca at an opera house in Bregenz, Austria. The primary issue on their agenda was the Tierra Project - a scheme to establish political and financial dominance of Bolivia by illicitly buying up the rights to their limited water supply, gaining a monopoly, and installing an amenable puppet dictator. However, James Bond crashes their meeting and identifies Karakov as a member of Quantum by using his smartphone to create a composite image, which is transmitted to MI6. Along with most of the hierarchy, the man promptly flees the auditorium and is not seen again, leaving his fate unknown.

After they leave, Natalya emerges from her hiding place and respectfully covers Anna's body with a sheet before escaping the facility. Anna was avenged after Onatopp was killed by James Bond in Cuba.
"
1578,/wiki/Cedar_Leiter,"Cedar Leiter was the fictional American intelligence operative and daughter of Felix Leiter who spied for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The character first appeared as an ally and love interest in John Gardner's 1982 James Bond continuation novel, For Special Services, and was mentioned in several successive books in his continuity.
In 2020, Cedar Leiter was unexpectedly referenced alongside the cinematic character Della Churchill in Dynamite Entertainment's James Bond graphic novel, Reflections of Death.
Prior to the events in the novel, Leiter began her career when she was eighteen serving as a secretary in the U.S. State Department. Within a year, she was approached to work for the Central Intelligence Agency. She eventually decided to keep her job at the State Department, though she went through a comprehensive course to become a CIA operative during vacations, weekends, and certain evenings.
After meeting Bismaquer, Bond later meets his French wife, Nena, and shows them the Hogarth prints. When Bismaquer tries to purchase them, Bond, now using his Christian name, states the prints are not for sale. After a dinner the following evening, Bismaquer challenges Bond to a race against Walter Luxor for $1 million and the prints; Bond unhesitantly agrees. As they depart for their cabin, Bond and Leiter are almost killed in a fatal car crash, and hide the body of the deceased pickup driver. That same night, Bond and Leiter spy on Bismaquer's ice cream factory where Leiter informs Bond on the pasteurization of the ice cream. Also, Bond overhears a conservation between Bismaquer, Luxor, and two employees where they discuss a chemical added to the ice cream that eliminates reason and conscience, and makes the consumer completely submissive to another person's orders.
In Icebreaker, Cedar is revealed to still be working at the CIA despite her father's having found out about her career as an agent. After discovering that her colleague ""Bad Brad"" Tirpitz was going to work with her friend James Bond on a mission in Finland, she sends him her regards.

1580,/wiki/1948_Maserati_4CLT,"In the late 1930s, continued rapid development in the increasingly competitive international voiturette class, and the introduction of the Alfa Romeo 158 and ERA B- and C-type models, forced the Maserati brothers into designing a new, square-bore, inline-4-cylinder engine. This new engine developed 30–50 bhp more than the previous inline-6, the increase mostly achieved through an increase to four valves per cylinder, coupled to the use of a more powerful supercharger and a small increase in the compression ratio. Following customary Maserati practice, the engine was mounted into a chassis design almost identical to that of the 4CL's predecessor: the Maserati 6CM. Conventional in its architecture, twin box-section spars ran the length of the car joined, ladder-fashion, by smaller cross members, although the 4CL design did incorporate more aluminium componentry than its forebear. Although near-identical in its wheelbase, the 4CL's track was a full 5 cm (1.97 in) wider than the 6CM, and sat lower thanks to repositioned spring hangers.
Ian Fleming's character James Bond was to drive one in the TV James Bond episode Murder On Wheels (it was never made and abandoned after the films success). However he drives one in the Anthony Horowitz 2015 James Bond novel Trigger Mortis .
In Fleming's original unpublished notes, Bond is at the Nürburgring in Germany, the infamous race track to stop SMERSH agents from deliberately sabotaging a race which will kill the British race car driver Stirling Moss and make it look like an unfortunate accident . He is trained to drive the Maserati by a female racer to tackle the course and he eventually defeats the agent by making him lose control of his vehicle and saves Moss's life.

"
1588,/wiki/Camille,"Camille Montes was the youngest daughter of Ernesto Montes, a Bolivian military officer employed by the Junta of Commanders of the Armed Forces (and apparently a ""very cruel man""), and an unidentified Russian prima ballerina. When she was a young girl, the opposition in Bolivia sent General Medrano to the family house; he shot Ernesto, raped Camille's mother and eldest sister before strangling them to death, and then smiles at Camille before leaving and setting the house on fire, which is the cause for the burnt scars on her back. This left Camille severely traumatised and pyrophobic, but also instilled in her a burning (pun not intended) hatred of and desire to kill Medrano. Once she was old enough, she joined the Bolivian Secret Service and spent a long time waiting for a chance at revenge. To that end, Camille has approached environmentalist and Quantum operative, Dominic Greene, and slept with him in order to be able to reach Medrano with whom Greene made a deal in overthrowing the Bolivian government in exchange for giving ownership of a seemingly barren piece of Bolivian land for its vast resources.
In August 2006, realizing that Camille only sleeps with him to approach Medrano and she is trying to kill him, Greene sent hitman Edmund Slate to murder her by pretending to be a geologist with whom she had planned a meeting at Port-au-Prince, Haiti. However, British Secret Service agent James Bond kills Slate in his hotel room with his own agenda and taks the assassin's briefcase. As the spy is walking on the street, Camille sees him and tells him to get in her car, mistaking him for the geologist. As the Bolivian operative drives 007 off, she finds a gun and a picture of herself at the bottom of the briefcase and pulls her gun on Bond, who quickly jumps out of the car commenting ""That wasn't very nice!"". Camille later goes to a nearby dockside to confront Greene for trying to get her killed but the villain turns her over to Medrano, requesting that he kills her once he is done with her to sweeten their new partnership. Fortunately, Bond pursues them and manages to save Camille and the pair make escape, killing many of Medrano's men in the process. An unconscious Camille is then dropped off at a hotel down the river before Bond continues his investigation of Greene.
A few days later, Camille is present at a party hosted by Greene, who celebrates the land in Bolivia and attempts to make other deals. In order to force the billionaire to tell him where Medrano is, Camille makes him lose investors and a furious Greene tries to push the spy through a balcony, but Bond intervenes again and leaves with Montes. The criminal operative sends his right-hand man Elvis after them but 007's colleague Strawberry Fields trips the henchman and sends him tumbling down a staircase, leaving Bond and Camille leave the party. Unfortunately, Greene has the corrupt Bolivian police chief murdering French agent René Mathis in order to frame Bond and have the spy arrested by the police. However, Bond and Camille manages to escape after killing two of Carlos' policemen and then borrow an antiquated transport plane. Their pilot towards Bolivia's Atacama Desert to learn more about Greene and Medrano's plans. Carlos so dispatches a militarized Aermacchi SF.260TP fighter-trainer to pursue the duo and kill them on sight. To that end, the unidentified pilot riddles Bond and Camille's plane with bullets, destroying one of the engines and causing it to produce heavy smoke. Despite the damage, Bond manages to improvise by using the smoke to block the pilot's vision, placing his aircraft in such a manner as to reduce the SF.260's airspeed; causing him to lose control and crash into a rock formation. Bond and Camille fall into a chasm but survive thanks to a parachute. While they are alone, Camille talks with Bond about his motives for her revenge against Medrano.
The pair later leads a raid at Perla de las Dunas where Greene and Medrano attempt to finalise their deal, killing all of Greene's thugs and Medrano's men. As Bond fights against Greene, Camille makes her way to Medrano' suite, where she frees the maid the general attempted to rape and lets her escape. However, Medrano attacks the vengeful agent, gloating of the time when he raped and killed her mother. The ruthless General then tries to rape Camille, but she fights back and grabs her gun, aiming at Medrano. Swearing that she will burn, the dictator foolishly charges at Camille in an attempt to kill her, but the latter forcibly shoots the General in the head, killing him and ending her quest for vengeance. However, as the burning hotel is falling apart, Camille starts to panic but manages to escape the building with Bond, leaving Medrano's corpse to be buried in the rubble. Bond later escorts her to a train station where she is last seen walking for an unknown future.
Barbara Broccoli has said that she intends for Camille to return for a future film. If this happens, Camille will become the second Bond girl, alongside Madeleine Swann, to make a return appearance since Eunice Gayson, as Sylvia Trench, appeared in Dr. No and From Russia with Love and Rubelvitch from The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy, albeit as a minor character.

1589,/wiki/General_Arkady_Ourumov_(Laurence_Possa),"General Arkady Ourumov is commander of the Russian Space Division, a member of the Janus Syndicate and one of the primary villains in the 2010 James Bond video-game GoldenEye 007. He was portrayed by Laurence Possa, who would also provide the voice of Stefan Pomerov in the video-game Blood Stone.
In the 2010 remake of GoldenEye 007, General Ourumov has a broader bodily frame, shorter hair and wears dark grey military clothing instead of green. MI6 discovers that Ourumov has been receiving large cash transfers that trace back to a Nigerian shell corporation, the Janus Group. At the start of the game, Bond and Trevelyan (006) are briefed by M on their infiltration of the Arkangelsk Chemical Weapons Facility, commandeered by Ourumov. The general himself had been stealing Russian military equipment and selling it on the black market, and he plans to sell a sample of high-tech weapons to a terrorist organization arriving on that day.
Bond and Trevelyan sneak into the facility and Bond eventually plants timed explosives on a number of fuel tanks, but later discovers that Ourumov has captured Trevelyan and has him at gunpoint. Ourumov threatens to kill Trevelyan if Bond does not throw down his weapon, but Bond takes refuge behind a stack of fuel canisters. One of Ourumov's soldiers tries to shoot Bond, but the general tells him not to for the fear of blowing them up. After a second soldier tries to fire at Bond, Ourumov shoots them. Bond eventually drops his gun and raises his hands, but Ourumov shoots Trevelyan anyway, then walks towards Bond to eliminate him as well. Before he can fire though, Bond sets off the timed explosives on the fuel tanks and catches Ourumov and his soldiers off guard, giving Bond the chance to escape.
Following the destruction of the Arkangelsk Facility and the loss of Janus' EMP hardened helicopter, Ouromov attempts to procure a second helicopter via Russian gangster Valentin Zukovsky. Zukovsky points him in the direction of the annual Dubai arms fair. Ourumov and Xenia enter Dubai using fake passports, murder the head of security at the arms fair, Sky Briggs, and attempt to steal the EMP-hardened helicopter being unveiled onboard the carrier. Bond tries to stop them but fails.
When Bond and Natalya Simonova are being interrogated by Defence Minister Dmitri Mishkin in the Archives level, Ourumov bursts into the room fearing Bond will reveal too much information about him and his plans. Therefore, he kills Mishkin and frames Bond for the murder, then takes Natalya hostage before leaving the archives. Bond manages to escape from Mishkin's guards, and as Ourumov makes off with Natalya in his car, Bond hijacks a tank and chases the general through the streets of St. Petersburg. After causing much destruction, Bond eventually reaches a station where Ourumov takes Natalya on board a train. Just before it leaves, Bond drives the tank into one of the carriages and derails it, then deals with a great number of Ourumov's soldiers.
After eventually boarding the train, Bond confronts Ourumov and Xenia Onatopp in one of the carriages. Ourumov arrogantly taunts Bond, thinking that this time he will not escape, and Xenia then asks him for the GoldenEye controller. The general claims that this was not part of their plan, that he was supposed to give the controller to Alec Trevelyan, and therefore refuses, at which point Xenia uses the gun she is holding to fire a single shot into Ourumov's heart, killing him. Ourumov's body is incinerated when Xenia Onatopp blows up the train.

1590,/wiki/GoldenEye_(character),"Mr. Hunter, best known by his moniker GoldenEye, is a fictional discharged MI6 intelligence operative and chief enforcer to Auric Goldfinger. The protagonist of Electronic Arts' 2004 video-game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, the character is not part of the formal 007 continuity, as the game's plot is set in an alternate timeline.
Once a candidate for “00” status, Hunter began a swift descent into darkness after an operation against the notorious Dr. Julius No, who personally fired the shot that cost him his right eye. Three years after the incident, he was evaluated through a holographic simulation in which he is paired with James Bond to stop Goldfinger from blowing up Fort Knox. He fails miserably, being directly responsible for the 'death' of 007, and was summarily dismissed from Her Majesty’s Secret Service for ""reckless brutality"". Previously approached by Goldfinger with an offer of employment, he accepted the villain's offer and was recruited to become his chief enforcer, with the promise that he would have his vengeance against Dr. No. He subsequently travels to meet with Goldfinger. At Goldfinger’s behest, one of Francisco Scaramanga's scientific contacts restores his sight with a gold-hued cybernetic eye, earning the rogue agent the name GoldenEye. In addition, Scaramanga arranges for periodic upgrades of the eye, starting with MRI vision. A master of weapons and explosives, GoldenEye’s unwavering mission is one of extreme vengeance.
Searching for the location of Dr. No's private island, Crab Key, GoldenEye was dispatched to the Organisation's underwater trading outpost, The Octopus, in a bid to retrieve the navigation coordinates from its computer system. To aid him, he was upgraded with a final augment - a magnetic field generator. During the mission, knowing he would need an escape plan, Goldeneye charged a small underwater craft along with a supply of explosives to Goldfinger's account; much to his employer's disgust. He was eventually sent to Crab Key, where he confronted Dr. Julius No. During their duel, GoldenEye used his bionic eye to sabotage the island's nuclear reactor and fatally electrocute the scientist. Upon No's death, Goldfinger swiftly betrayed and abandoned Hunter; revealing that he had been using the enforcer as part of his larger scheme to take over the Organisation. The operative narrowly managed to escape the island's resulting atomic meltdown in a stolen aircraft.

The following morning he is seen forcefully denying Bond's Swiss contact, Shaun Campbell access to the Piz Gloria clinic as the man attempts to use the cable car, shouting him out the door and closing it after him. Campbell subsequently tries to scale the mountain face, but is caught by Grunther and his security team while Bond is curling with the other guests. He is escorted back down via cable car and, unbeknownst to Bond, killed with an undisclosed method. 
Later that evening, Bond lets himself into one of the patients' rooms as he had been doing throughout his stay, only to be greeted by Frauleïn Bunt, hiding in the guest's bed, and Grunther, who knocks him unconscious with a blow to the back of the head. Aware of his identity, Blofeld and Grunther escort 007 to be locked in the room where the cable car's mechanical components are installed. On the way, Blofeld takes the opportunity to point out Campbell's corpse hanging from the rockface outside. Bond tries to attack him, but is restrained by Grunther and another guard.
Bond quickly escapes from the cable car room and takes to the slopes on a stolen pair of skis. His escape doesn't go unnoticed and Grunther frantically alerts Blofeld by phone. Taking a team of men with him, he pursues Bond down the mountain before losing control and crashing into a tree. Bond temporarily evades his pursuers and reunites with his fiancée, Tracy, in a nearby village before being relocated by Blofeld and Grunther the following day. The chase resumes across the road, through Lauterbrunnen again and then the alps, concluding with Blofeld launching a flair and causing an avalanche which buries 007 and Tracy.
Assuming Bond to be dead, Grunther is dispatched to take the incapacitated Tracy back to Piz Gloria. However, Bond survives the incident and returns to London. The next day, he returns and assaults the clinic with the help of Tracy's father, Marc-Ange Draco. Grunther alerts Blofeld to Draco's incoming helicopters, only to have the mastermind dismiss the warning, thinking they are harmless delivery choppers. As chaos ensues, Grunther is ordered by Blofeld to deal with Tracy with another guard. The two fight hand-to-hand, with the girl wielding a broken bottle and the guard holding a cudgel. Tracy manages to knock him down the stairs through a wall or ornamental rings and he is ultimately killed when she throws him against a set of decorative wall spikes, stabbing him through the back.
In his role as a stuntman, Yuri Borienko was one of the people who assisted in the auditioning of George Lazenby for the part of James Bond. In 1968, Lazenby was required to 'fight' Borienko as part of his screen test at Pinewood Studios. During this, Lazenby punched the wrestler unexpectedly and broke his nose on accident.

1599,/wiki/Becoming_Bond_(documentary),"Christopher LeggettJosh GreenbaumThe stranger-than-fiction true story of George Lazenby, a poor Australian car mechanic who, through an unbelievable set of circumstances, landed the role of James Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), despite having never acted a day in his life. Then after being offered the next seven Bond films and a $1 million signing bonus, he turned it all down.
It had gained mostly positive reviews on IMDB, 7.7/10 out of 435 votes and has an 80% score on Rotten Tomatoes from 15 critics. A positive review from Jim Vejvoda of IGN Movies stated, ""The charming, skillful storyteller George Lazenby himself is the best reason to watch Becoming Bond. The reenactments, while often funny and involving, simply can't hold a candle to the man and his anecdotes"". The documentary was praised for its humour and good storytelling, however it did not stray away from criticism. A negative review from Peter Sobczynski of RogerEbert.com stated, ""There is a potentially interesting film-documentary or fiction-in Lazenby's life and career, but Becoming Bond, despite its ambitions, is not it.""

1600,/wiki/General_Orlov,"Lieutenant-General Orlov was a fictional Soviet General and one of the two main antagonists in the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy (the other being Kamal Khan). He was portrayed by British actor Steven Berkoff. The character also appeared in the 1986 James Bond 007 tabletop role-playing game.
Orlov is a megalomaniacal Soviet General, he wears the rank insignia of a lieutenant-general, who believes that the Warsaw Pact has a decisive advantage over NATO in conventional military strength that is being tossed away by its leaders in détente. Rejecting their diplomacy, he advocates a massive military attack in Europe to seize dominance of the continent and call (what he thinks is) NATO's nuclear bluff. However, his proposal for a full-scale invasion of Europe is flatly rejected, with General Gogol being the loudest voice, in part because NATO would respond with nuclear strikes that would escalate the conflict to a global nuclear war. Gogol also seems to hold Orlov in contempt, feeling that his thirst for power is dangerous.
To eliminate that objection, Orlov's plan involves the detonation of an atomic bomb at a circus performance inside a United States Air Force base in West Germany. The effects of the bomb would be indistinguishable from American atomic bombs, and the explosion would be assumed to be an accident (as a nuclear strike would trigger the Air Force's early warning systems), prompting nuclear disarmament throughout the West and the East. Under Orlov's reasoning, with the nuclear factor taken out of the equation, the superior numbers of the Soviets would then be able to defeat the West without threat of nuclear reprisal, or even resistance, from NATO.
Orlov's accomplice in this scheme is Kamal Khan, an exiled Afghan prince involved in jewelry smuggling. He pays Khan by stealing priceless Fabergé eggs from state depositories and replacing them with counterfeits. He gets James Bond's attention when MI6 agent 009, who had been working undercover, is killed with one of the counterfeits in his possession in West Germany.
With Khan's employee, Octopussy, the pair plan to use the latter's circus as a front for smuggling the original jewellery. Instead of selling the jewellery in Switzerland and split the profit, they replace it with the atomic bomb to detonate en route in West Germany, which Octopussy is unaware of.
Bond eventually confronts Orlov and attempts to force him to stop the train carrying the bomb, but he is interrupted by Russian soldiers. Orlov and Bond both race to catch the train, with Bond unknowingly taking the General's car with the jewellery. Orlov commands his soldiers to pursue Bond's car, which crashes into a river just after 007 managed to jump onto the train.
Finally Orlov also catches up with the circus train. However, he is gunned down by a border guard while trying to jump onto its back, as he has forcibly crossed the border between East and West Germany. By this point, General Gogol had discovered Orlov's role in the smuggling by retrieving Orlov's car containing the jewellery from the river. When the arriving Gogol calls him ""a disgrace to the uniform"", the dying Orlov utters his last words: ""Yes, but tomorrow, I shall be a hero of the Soviet Union,"" unaware that James Bond is about to foil the scheme.
Orlov was completely insane, having a manic fixation with the USSR gaining complete power over Europe, as opposed to General Gogol, who preferred to make peace with the West. He was also incredibly psychotic, not caring that thousands of people would die due to his plan. He also had no qualms with betraying Octopussy for his plan to succeed. In addition, he seemed to have a short temper, frequently snapping at people while arguing with them, seen most prominently in his confrontations with both General Gogol and James Bond.
